I discovered he was missing a small bone in the elbow area,

I'm afraid Gu Tian's arm will grow crooked.

What about splinting his bones with a wooden board?

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.510
A plank can be used

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:17.130
to treat common fractures,

If I fix it with a nail,

I can dissect it to reset the fracture

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.960

What's the best material?

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.570
Gold is too soft, copper rusts easily,

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:20.660

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.590
I'm staring at Sun Siming and Che Hujue.

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:16.590
They're not moving yet.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.190
Have you noticed

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:20.080
that there are no birds chirping here?

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.040
Isn't that strange?

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.400
Could it be that the drums before the game

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.320
scared the birds away?

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.870
I knew

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:46.430
Sun Siming couldn't follow the rules.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:48.390
Lord Wen.

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:51.240
The rules don't allow arms.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:54.000
The Chamber of Commerce doesn't follow the rules.

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:55.040
What should we do with them?

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:56.150
That's right, Father.

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:57.520
The Chamber of Commerce is cheating.

00:23:57.790 --> 00:23:59.520
They should be disqualified.

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:00.480
Sun Siming.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.560
You're shameless.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:05.040
Lord Wen.

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:09.040
Sun Siming disobeyed the rules

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.630
and hid weapons in the arena.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:13.800
The tournament can end now.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:15.280
Che.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.280
If you don't know how to use your head,

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.040
don't come to the tournament like everyone else.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.280
Lord Wen

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:21.320
only said

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.830
we couldn't bring weapons into the arena,

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.320
but he didn't say we couldn't

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.430
put them in the arena beforehand.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.480
I'm just taking advantage of a loophole in the rules.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.240
However, none of Ma Gang's generals

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.960
know how to use their heads.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:36.080
Sun Siming.

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:38.080
Do you want to die?

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.830
I have not thought this through,

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.590
but Chairman Sun has a point.

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:47.430
If there is no rule

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:49.390
against placing weapons on the field,

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:51.520
then

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:53.320
you may.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.520
Jibei Chamber of Commerce

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.870
is too shameless.

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:03.240
You are too stupid.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:05.720
If there is an afterlife, find a decent master.

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.800
Don't just bark like a dog at the end of your life.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.150
Gu Tian.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.480
The Chamber of Commerce's people are despicable.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.200
Two people are bullying one person.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.670
A handicapped man.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:57.520
Wu Xi.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:59.830
Are you really my ally?

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:00.750
[Illustrious And Wealthy]

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:02.000
You mean

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.870
you're going to ally yourself

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.560
with us in the tournament?

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:06.590
Yes.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.630
We can work together to eliminate

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:11.520
the Chamber of Commerce first.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.560
You're already disabled.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.080
What makes you think I'd agree?

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:19.430
I want to be prepared for the worst,

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.430
that Fu Sheng can't cure my arm.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:24.390
As the saying goes,

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.390
the enemy's enemy is a friend.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.000
Since we both have a grudge against the Chamber of Commerce,

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:31.720
we are friends.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.040
Why didn't Gu Tian tell us

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:51.960
he's allied with someone else?

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.670
He scared me.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:53.760
Don't panic.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.830
We must

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.150
prepare

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.390
for everything.

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:00.560
Luckily, Gu Tian is afraid of death

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.350
and prepared in advance.

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:04.560
Gu Tian,

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.150
if you can't handle this,

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:08.080
you don't deserve to be our ally.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.150
You've made an alliance?

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.520
I'll find something to use as a weapon.

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:14.870
Hold on.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:15.770
Hold on.

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:45.320
Gu Tian.

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:46.400
Are you done?

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.720
Right away.

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:50.090
Wu Xi, I'll help you.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:53.280
Let's go.

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:26.430
Wu Xi, help me.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.190
Wait.

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:29.110
Let me find something I can use as a weapon.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.190
Hold on.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.000
Are you messing with me?

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.800
What are you talking about?

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:35.190
I'm just doing what you did.

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:24.830
Wu Xi.

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:31.800
I'm going to kill you.

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:35.760
Che.

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:37.430
I'm sorry.

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:41.670
It's just the beginning.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.280
Let's see who gets

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:44.830
the last laugh.

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:48.280
You're tough.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:08.240
Get the jade plate.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.320
I'll handle them here.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:10.320
Yes, sir.

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:28.040
Chairman Guo.

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:29.720
I've done

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:30.590
what Chairman Sun told me,

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:38.390
so the reward...

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.150
There will be a reward.

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:41.760
Show me that.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:42.480
Okay.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.960
Are you going to put some nails

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.150
in Gu Tian's body?

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.320
What's the best material?

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:47.880
Gold is too soft, copper rusts easily,

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:48.870
and lead is toxic.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:50.910
They are not good.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.040
In Xichuan, you don't have to worry

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.870
about not having good metals.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:57.670
Right.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.320
There's Star Gold.

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.590
I knew Sun Siming wouldn't play by the rules.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.560
Luckily, I was prepared.

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:06.520
You made an arm out of Star Gold?

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:10.060
I made more than just an arm.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.320
Concentrate.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.190
I got it.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:32:59.960
Please give me inspiration.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.070
Do you remember when I said

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:04.770
there was no birdsong here?

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.910
Because this eagle was nearby

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:09.830
and scared away all the birds.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:12.870
The reason why the eagle nabbed the jade

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.830
must be because the bag containing the jade

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.430
had been soaked in blood before.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.870
That's why the bag smelled so stinky

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:21.350
when Gu Tian grabbed it.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.160
This kind of fishy smell

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:25.670
is what the eagle likes the most.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:27.560
Your Excellency.

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:29.200
Now the jade is lost.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.680
Will Fu Sheng blame us?

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.150
We have to thank Chairman Sun

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:36.040
for thoughtfully

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:38.430
asking a bird to rob us.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.350
Sun Siming has provoked Your Excellency several times.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.040
Let me arrest him.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:44.760
Forget it.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.280
Listen up.

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:47.910
Take a couple of able-bodied men

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.080
after that eagle.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.290
Such a treasure

00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:55.390
is carried away by a bird.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:57.350
Lord Wen.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.520
What should we do now?

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.270
I've asked Wen Jiu

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:03.240
to go after the eagle.

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:08.670
Fu Sheng.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.400
I just saw Guo Sishui

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.040
kill a man in the alley.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.080
That seems to be a guard from the Lord's Mansion.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.710
Lord's Mansion's guard?

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:19.150
I was too far away to hear what they said,

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:21.280
but I saw a wooden chest

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.550
in the guard's hand.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:23.730
That seems to be the chest

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:24.880
that held the treasure before the match.

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:28.400
The jade plate has been taken by an eagle.

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:31.670
Now there is only one left.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.630
Based on Sun Siming's reaction,

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.670
I think he bribed the guards at Lord's Mansion

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.150
and switched the chest containing the Painting of Luan.

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:55.480
See?

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.190
Someone cares about me.

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.920
My arm and dagger

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.750
are made of Star Gold.

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:16.040
It's a pity that you lost

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:17.480
the two border soldiers.

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:19.040
They were masters.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.150
Not at all.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.190
They've done their job.

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:24.360
They're all your men.

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:25.560
Why so cold-blooded?

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:28.230
Cut the crap. We should go.

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:34.000
Lord Wen.

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:36.190
Jibei Chamber of Commerce is outclassed.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.790
I've lost.

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:41.310
Goodbye.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:46.920
Fu Sheng.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.710
Sun Siming is running away. What should we do?

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:49.710
That's not important.

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:52.150
The most important thing now

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:53.770
is not to let Gu Tian know

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.000
that the box is empty.

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:56.560
Why?

00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:58.280
Since the box is empty,

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.440
there's no need for them to fight anymore.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.710
Why should one more person die?

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:02.880
But there is a rule before the match

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:03.670
that this is a death match.

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:05.710
They won't stop

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:07.000
until there's only one left.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.480
Only one of Wu Tou

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:09.920
and Gu Tian will survive.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:23.270
Your Excellency.

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:24.560
The bird flew too fast.

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.590
We lost it.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.670
Maybe it's fate.

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:40.600
I think you're out of your mind.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.960
This is the method Fu Sheng taught me.

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:42.880
Let me cure you.

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.750
Gu Tian.

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.560
Young Mistress.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.080
This is the rule set by the city lord.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.230
Please don't give us a hard time.

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:35.000
Sir.

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:47.840
Well done.

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:03.230
Protect the leader.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:04.400
Jiu, protect the Young Mistress.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.230
The Lord is in Xichuan.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:23.560
On my mark.

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:24.310
Yes, sir.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.150
Go with Chairman Guo

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:28.440
to meet the Lord.

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:29.230
Yes, sir.

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:36.670
Your Excellency.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:38.960
Father.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:46.630
Father.

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.880
Father, wake up.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.710
Fu Sheng, save my father.

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:55.110
The wound is a bit deep,

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:57.290
but his heart and lungs aren't hurt.

00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:58.270
Pulling out the arrow

00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:59.960
will cause him to hemorrhage.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.230
What should we do?

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:02.440
Take him to the clinic.

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.590
Prepare the carriage.

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:04.080
No.

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:05.710
The carriage will be bumpy. Get some men to carry him.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:06.400
Go on.

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:09.670
Report.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.360
The Jibei Army is attacking

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.190
and has reached the city.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.440
Sun Siming of the Jibei Chamber of Commerce

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.440
has left the city with his soldiers and turned to the enemy.

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:18.900
Damn.

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:20.400
He's so bold as to collaborate

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.710
with foreign enemies.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:22.780
If I had known,

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:23.920
I would have killed him.

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:27.310
Sun Siming took the Painting of Luan and the jade plate.

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.080
He's going to give them to Breakwall.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.080
Don't worry.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:32.040
I knew he was up to no good.

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.670
The jade plate is fake. I have the real one.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.080
My Lord.

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:04.750
I, Sun Siming,

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:06.920
have got

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:08.400
the Bird Jade Plate

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:09.840
and the Painting of Luan.

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:13.080
Come here.

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.080
My Lord.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.110
I've gone through a lot of trouble

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.840
to get this treasure.

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:38.670
Congratulations, My Lord.

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:40.800
With this jade and painting,

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.040
you can open the Treasure of the Sealed Book.

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.000
My Lord.

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.270
Why did you do this?

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:54.000
Sun Siming.

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.000
How dare you?

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:57.760
This jade is so poorly made,

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.110
yet you dare to deceive me with it.

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:01.840
Fake?

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:03.130
Impossible.

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.600
I saw with my own eyes

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:05.480
that Fu Sheng

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:06.800
put this in the box.

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:07.880
How can it be fake?

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:10.630
Father, calm down.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.000
It's not good for your health.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:12.840
You...

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.000
If you have anything to say,

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:21.400
go to the other world and tell Liu Yunting.
