I've told you several times.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.520
My name is Gu Tian.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.390
I never and will never change my name.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.540
It's the only name my father gave me,

so what else could I be called?

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.830
You're lying in the Mansion,

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.350
so you don't want to join the Mansion?

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.350

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.390
and repeatedly asked about my name.

Your Majesty,

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.790
you're the King of Jibei State.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.520
Just agree

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.880
before you get beaten up.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.560
Who is the King?

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.000
Your Majesty,

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:37.680
this man's family name is Su.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.260
He volunteered to become a eunuch.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.560
I asked him his name,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.560
but he kept arguing and trying to fool me.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.790
I sensed that he was up to no good,

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.690
so I was reluctant to hire him,

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.800
but he insisted on seeing you.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.440
Please make a decision.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.030
His family name is Su,

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.590
and he wants to be a eunuch,

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.120
so are you...

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.950
Su Rang.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.510
Yes.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:07.640
I'm Su Rang.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.880
Su Rang, you jerk.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.080
The King is here, but how dare you clamor?

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.830
Stop it.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.440
You just said

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.470
I'm the Jibei King.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.760
Since I'm the King

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.710
and you still obey me,

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.800
don't hit him.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.120
Yes, sir.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.590
Do you want to keep this man

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:29.950
at your side?

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.350
Please decide.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.080
Please decide.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.440
What should I choose?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.760
Just say whatever you want.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.840
Let me out of the palace.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.240
Don't make me stay here.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:47.800
Let me think about it.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.500
Then I'll decide

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.270
to keep this man in the palace as an attendant.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.350
Keep him.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.030
Do you really want me to be a eunuch?

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.680
Don't shout.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.200
So did we pick the right one?

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.680
I think so.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.590
They've all disappeared,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.560
and we seem to be fine.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.590
Help me up.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.680
My legs have gone numb.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.320
Fu Sheng, you're evil.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.400
You really want me to be a eunuch?

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.200
Aren't you afraid those lunatics will cut me down

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.350
and leave me with no offspring?

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.790
Don't you have some younger brothers?

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:39.960
I...

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.260
Don't be angry.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.080
I'll kill you.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.030
Listen to me.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.010
I reckon

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.820
everything we just saw

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.430

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.810
You mean

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.340
those masked men

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.940
used all this to show us

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.140

I chose wrong.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:11.680
My Lord.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.660
There are several traces of mining on the rock walls,

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.430
so this could be a subterranean space that someone mined

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.910
with the help of natural underground caverns.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.150
If this underground space was mined,

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.280
how many people and how long

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.340
do you estimate it would take?

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.520
In the case of the border army, for example,

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:32.640
it would take several years to mine out

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.480
such a huge space,

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.030
but we've just entered the underground.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.720
If there's a bigger space behind this passage,

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.550
then I'm afraid it's not something that can be accomplished

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.310
by the border army alone.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.080
Then what you are saying is...

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:47.790
Even if Jibei State were to do it,

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.030
it would take the strength of the nation.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:52.720
My Lord.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.150
There's a wide square up ahead.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.600
Let's take a look.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:12.120
How are you?

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:16.430
I'm poisoned,

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.880
but the poison is on you.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:19.940
On me?

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.890
OK, don't move.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.780
The poison

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.980
may have been used against me.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.120
It's because it's used against you

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:32.340
that I should get rid of it.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:33.700
Don't bother.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.370
I wouldn't have suffered this

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.220
if I had picked the right one.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:41.180
So what now?

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:42.770
Let's go out and cure the poison.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:44.460
No.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:47.460
I've used the needle

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.130
to hold the poison back for now.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.610
We'll talk about the rest

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.090
of the poison when we get out.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.850
In the song, it says

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.120
that the late Jibei King

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.530
was poisoned by Su Rang,

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:05.730
and you just chose to allow Su Rang

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.130
to enter the palace and serve you,

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.420
so is that why

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:12.610
you were poisoned?

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:13.730
Possibly.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.580
Looks like we'll have to be careful

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:29.380
I'll do it, OK?

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:33.930
Wait a minute.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.380
Since I'm the King,

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.380
how dare you do this to me?

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.380
You're eight years old,

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:41.410
so you should be more sensible.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:42.980
How old am I?

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:43.780
Eight.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.080
Do I look like I'm eight?

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.160
I've taught you day and night

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.280
since you were born.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.920
It's been eight years and three months now.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:53.770
Isn't that right?

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.320
That's right.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:55.320
That's right.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:57.830
Looks like

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:00.400
Jibei King's life is miserable too.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.950
Why did you hit me again?

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.560
As a king,

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.280
you must always maintain the majesty

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:08.800
to manage your subordinates well.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:09.830
Making faces.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:10.920
What kind of behavior is this!

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.040
Right.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.230
Okay. I'm sorry.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.230
You have succeeded to the throne

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:16.920
but are not allowed to handle political affairs.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.230
You take orders from Attendant Su

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:21.920
and are confined hereto learn etiquette,

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.990
so do you resent that?

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:24.590
No.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:26.560
Your education was right.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.740
I am convinced

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:28.710
and have no complaints.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.040
I do.

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:33.280
I do, okay?

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:35.830
I get beaten up no matter what I say,

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:36.750
so what am I supposed to do?

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:38.950
Let me ask you.

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:41.380
If disaster struck Jibei

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.700
and the people were left starving,

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.830
how do you respond?

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.440
Open the granaries and release grain.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.230
Stupid.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:52.800
Keep thinking.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.040
Is it wrong to do that?

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.750
Sun Siming.

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:00.920
Fu Sheng. Gu Tian.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:01.800
You've come at the right time.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.630
What should we do

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:04.800
if there is a famine?

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.350
Open the gates and distribute food.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.040
That's not what I said.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.040
They said that, but why hitting me?

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.710
You're being half-hearted again.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:16.660
Your Majesty.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:19.110
I'm sorry.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.160
It's my fault.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.870
Su Rang, that jerk, wanted to rebel

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.160
and didn't want you to handle the government,

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.130
so you became his puppet.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.610
Your Majesty.

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:35.460
If you don't study hard,

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:37.160
how can you

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:40.160
kill Su Rang later?

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:41.200
Kill Su Rang?

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.800
Are you crazy?

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.470
Please remember.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:45.520
You

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.800
are the Lord of Jibei.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.800
Difficulties are only temporary.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:52.750
One day,

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.680
you will be able to kill the traitor

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.200
and take back the throne.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.590
Attendant Su is here.

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:14.560
Hello, Attendant Su.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.870
Your Majesty.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.630
You've learned etiquette for so long,

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:20.710
but you still don't bow when you see me.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:22.680
It seems

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.850
the education wasn't done properly.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.470
Come on.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:28.710
Drag him out

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:29.800
and execute him.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:33.400
You jerk.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:34.750
Your Majesty, please bear this in mind.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.760
What this eunuch's done is the root of disaster.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:38.830
All right.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.750
All except His Majesty,

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.320
leave here.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:52.830
When the late King died,

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.230
he entrusted the rule

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.990
of the country to three ministers.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:58.830
He wanted us to work

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:00.800
hand in hand to aid you,

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:03.990
but I found out today

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:08.200
that those two have been colluding with foreigners

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.080
and betraying Jibei,

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:12.400
so I made an immediate decision

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:14.750
to execute those two.

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:17.470
Your Majesty.

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:19.400
Get up.

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.680
There will be no more worries

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.800
in Jibei State.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.920
It seems that from this day on,

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.750
Su Rang became the ruler of Jibei State.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:43.920
I got carried away

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.470
and drank too much,

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.800
so now I'd like to take a nap.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:51.990
Your Majesty,

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:54.920
please fan me.

What do you think?

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.150
I was faced

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.040
with a choice once before.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.910
I followed history to keep Su Rang with me,

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.190
but I chose wrong,

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.210
so

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:12.430
I was punished.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.350
Choosing based on history is wrong.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:19.190
It seems that I can't

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.630
make it the same as history.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.390
I need to kill this person.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.380
Wait a minute.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.480
What about my choice?

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.920
I've already killed Su Rang,

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.870
so it looks like the Treasure

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.160
of the Sealed Book is mine.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:29.840
Who's that?

Physician Fu, help me.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.150
Physician Fu.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:23.800
He's been setting us up,

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:25.150
so why should we care about him?

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:27.520
This is a dangerous place.

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:28.750
One more person

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:30.590
is one more way.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.670
Letting me live won't do you any harm.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:41.670
Have you seen Wen Jue?

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:42.560
No,

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.670
I haven't.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:58.590
I didn't expect

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.560
such grandeur in this cave.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.840
No wonder the surviving rebels came here.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.390
Looks like it's a relic left behind

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.390
by our old ancestors.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:08.590
My Lord.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:10.480
There are signs of human life in the square.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.040
My Lord, look.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.190
The pot is still warm.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.800
I sensed something was wrong

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.730
as soon as I came in.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.700
The smell seemed familiar.

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:45.060
Sure enough,

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.020
some of our old friends

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.140
have lived here.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:49.970
Sishui.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:52.500
Smell it.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:21:59.490
Sorry for my ignorance.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.760
You've been in the army for a long time, so you don't know

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.480
it's Longxian Incense commonly used by the royal family.

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:11.030
Only people from Liu's clan can use it.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.520
So is this where the rebels

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.790
were hiding?

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.590
More than ten years later,

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:21.920

My Lord, don't.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:02.190
What are you afraid of?

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:04.240
Can that hole

swallow a man?

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:05.990
Let's go.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.840
Hello, My Lord.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.040
Do you

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:14.190
think we're

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:16.670
on solid ground?

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.080
But I think we're

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:21.320
at stake.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.880
My Lord, please don't joke.

Jibei's power

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.230
is in our hands,

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.360
so who can threaten us?

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.230
Who would dare

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.120
assassinate Lord?

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.270
It's Liu Luan.

His Majesty?

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:53.080
Our King has grown up.

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:55.430
He is disgruntled to see me

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:57.560
in control of the court.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.120
And I suspect he already knows

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.080
we killed the late King.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.270
What should we do?

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.350
What should we do?

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:07.230
Don't be afraid.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.750
Since we've done it once,

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.560
we can do it again.

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:14.640
Zhu.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.230
I've heard your ancestors

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.880
had a skill

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:25.120
called face-changing

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.040
that can remake one person's face

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.360
to match another's.

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:31.270
Yes.

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:35.600
Good.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.990
Then you do this.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:40.840
Yes, sir.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:47.080
How dare you hide in the dark and spread lies here?

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.880
Take them down.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.470
My Lord.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.040
I think

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.640
we're back.

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.910
My Lord, be careful.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.320
Protect the Lord.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.560
Where is this place?

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.750
Fu Sheng.

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:57.670
Fu Sheng.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:00.750
Gu Tian.

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:03.270
Where are you?

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:16.320
There's no painkiller here,

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:18.190
so I have to use acupuncture.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:19.800
Bear with it.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:21.880
I feel much better.

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:24.160
Thank you, Physician Fu.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:26.840
Otherwise, I would have bled to death.

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:28.120
I didn't expect you

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:30.270
to save me even after all the misunderstandings

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:31.230
between us.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.600
Jibei King was so tough

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.710
that he dared to assassinate Su Rang at the age of eight.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.470
You said there's bad blood between the two,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.800
so could we use that

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:45.160
to ask Lord Wen

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.600
to find a way to drive a wedge between them?

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.120
But I don't think

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:51.190
it's that simple.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.490
I met Jibei King

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:54.320
in Su Rang's army.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.230
Jibei King has,

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.990
how should I put it,

00:27:58.590 --> 00:27:59.400
a lot of respect for Su Rang.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.990
He calls Su Rang

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:02.710
Father.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.410
- Why has Jibei King - Fu Sheng.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.380
- changed so much? - Fu Sheng.

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.560
Gu Tian.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:12.470
Where are you?

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:14.110
Gu Tian.

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:14.950
It's Wen Jue.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.170
Fu Sheng.

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:18.040
Where are you?

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:20.230
Fu Sheng.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.160
Gu Tian.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.320
Which hole is it this time?

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:30.400
Fu Sheng.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:32.600
Gu Tian.

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:35.120
Where are you?

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.600
Fu Sheng.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:39.800
Fu Sheng.

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:41.510
Over there.

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:43.050
Gu Tian.

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:45.120
Fu Sheng.

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:46.920
Fu Sheng.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:47.990
Where is Wen Jue?

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:50.160
Why is the sound going left and right?

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.270
There's an echo here.

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:52.110
Let's split up.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.880
I'll go that way.

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:54.480
Fu Sheng.

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:56.040
Fu Sheng.

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.990
Gu Tian.

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.950
Fu Sheng.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:00.880
Fu Sheng.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:03.950
Gu Tian.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.470
Where are you?

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:15.400
Wen Jue, where are you?

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.670
Fu Sheng, I'm here.

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:23.510
Why are you dressed like this?

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:24.800
Are you okay?

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:26.800
I don't know what happened.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.120
I woke up like this

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.910
in wedding clothes.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.400
And my head hurts

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.840
like I've been hit.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:33.950
That's right.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.360
We've all been hit.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.520
Where's Gu Tian?

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.470
Is he okay?

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:42.040
He's looking for you too.

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:48.710
What's that noise?

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:49.990
Don't worry about the noise.

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.750
Let's go.

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:51.560
Okay.

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:05.510
My Lord.

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:08.910
This is an old crossbow

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:10.840
used by the Royal Army 20 years ago.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.800
It was only for the Royal Army,

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:14.950
and it's a little shorter than today's arrows.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:16.950
But it's less accurate,

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:18.990
so it was abandoned years ago.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.400
They're just a bunch of pretenders.

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:27.190
Search the entire cave.

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:28.800
I want to see

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.840
if we can find anything.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:31.670
Aye.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.990
Treat those who are injured.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.750
The rest, split up and search.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:37.510
Yes, sir.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:38.470
Follow me.

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.950
Gu Tian.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.190
I finally found you.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:52.710
You didn't find her either?

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.590
But

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:57.470
the Young Mistress's cries are gone.

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.600
Has Fu Sheng found her?

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:02.670
Let's go.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:05.840
Wait for me.

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.160
What's going on?

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.600
Where is this place?

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:22.880
It feels like someone's getting married.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:28.910
Ghosts!

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:31.190
They're not ghosts but performers.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:32.430
We have to

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.910
make a choice after they dance.

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:35.750
That's one of the tests.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.910
The ghosts are going to sing

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:39.080
and test us?

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:48.200
♪Jibei King♪

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:52.750
♪Was betrothed at fourteen♪

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:57.400
♪Lord planned to kill him♪

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:02.910
♪And lure Liu Luan into doing it♪

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.710
Who's getting married?

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:13.400
Isn't Jibei King in his 30s?

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.560
Why is he getting married now?

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:15.910
I don't know.

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:21.510
My Lord.

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:22.800
We searched the area

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:24.120
but found no hidden entrance.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:27.640
My Lord.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.320
It's difficult to defend this place,

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:31.360
so can we go back to the cave and confer later?

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:36.080
OK.

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:38.160
Stay at the entrance.

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:40.950
Let's see if these old men really won't come out.

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:43.160
Let's go.

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:44.400
Let's go.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.040
There's something wrong with these guys.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:59.230
Why don't we leave?

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:01.120
Let's see what they're up to.

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:09.320
Your Majesty, why aren't you wearing your wedding clothes?

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:11.990
What do you mean?

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.320
Who are you people?

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:14.510
Your Majesty, please don't joke.

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:18.640
Congratulations on your marriage.

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:22.270
The time has come.

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:25.470
Please attend the ceremony.

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:28.990
What if I don't agree?

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.950
Then we'll see whether

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:32.710
you are ruthless enough.

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:36.320
What's wrong with you?

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.910
I don't know.

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.880
You were poisoned.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:41.470
When?

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.670
Let's go.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.560
What do you want?

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:55.640
This is Hejin Wine.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:57.120
It contains the antidote

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:59.500
that can cure the poison.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.880
Drink this wine,

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:04.580
and you will officially become husband and wife.

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:06.810
After the ceremony,

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.800
you can leave.

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:28.270
What's going on?

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:30.670
Yours is the antidote.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.710
Mine is the poison.

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:35.150
Then don't drink it.

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:35.920
I'll drink the antidote,

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.120
and then let's find a way to get out.

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.710
No.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:39.220
If you don't drink the poison,

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:41.600
you can't get out.

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:43.350
What do you mean?

00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:44.600
Wen Jue.

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:47.190
I've finished.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.960
Can we go now?

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:54.920
Let's go.

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:57.310
Wen Jue.

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:03.750
Wen Jue.

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:05.440
That's poisoned wine.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:07.870
I know.

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:10.960
If I drank the poisoned wine,

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.080
you could save me,

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.000
but if you drank it,

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:18.350
who could save you?

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:20.440
Fu Sheng.

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:23.120
You're the best physician I've ever seen.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.350
You can cure me,

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.790
right?

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.830
Why can't I sense it?

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.760
What kind of poison did you give?

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:34.710
You can't cure me,

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.560
can you?

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:47.670
Am I ugly now?

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:51.040
No.

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:54.960
How did we come to this shabby place again?

00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:56.870
Is this shabby?

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.160
I finally found you.

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:07.080
What happened to Wen Jue?

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.390
Why didn't you save her?

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.120
I didn't know how the poison was spreading

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.710
or have the antidote.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.160
And I didn't dare to use the needles.

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:27.520
Give her the antidote,

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:28.830
or you'll die first.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:35.120
There is no antidote.

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:52.040
Gu Tian.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:53.560
Don't bother yourself.

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.270
Please

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.160
take care of Fu Sheng.

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:07.480
He forgets to eat when he studies medicine.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.600
If you ask him to put down what he's doing,

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.350
he'll get angry with you.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.190
At this time,

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.080
don't eat

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:23.080
and sit down

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:24.600
to keep him company.

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:29.600
Shortly, he won't be able to take it

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:33.120
and will start eating.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:36.670
Also,

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:40.390
he sometimes needs your help

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:42.710
when he stitches up after surgery.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.240
You've got a steady hand,

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:49.640
so you'll make it.

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:52.390
And...

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.040
And...

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:57.710
Fu Sheng.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.920
I don't want to die.

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:04.270
Am I really going to die?

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.280
But

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:08.640
I don't want to die here.

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:11.920
It's too dark,

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:13.710
and there are

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:15.270
so many bugs.

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:17.540
I'm scared.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:20.560
Help me.

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:22.560
Help me.

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:24.190
I will.

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:26.390
Don't worry.

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:28.130
I'll get you out.

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:29.750
I'll get you out.

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.750
Wen Jue.

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:59.160
The blue color on your face is gone.

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:00.960
Really?

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:03.310
Fu Sheng, I'm fine.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:06.270
Where is Fu Sheng?

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:07.310
Fu Sheng.

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:10.040
Fu Sheng.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.670
Fu Sheng.

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:15.520
Fu Sheng.

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:19.830
Young Mistress.

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.270
Don't panic.

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.520
A kind man like Fu Sheng

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:23.830
will live a long life.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:27.190
The masked men probably took him away

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.750
to look for the Treasure of the Sealed Book.

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.960
I see.

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:33.920
What we saw just now were all illusions.

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:37.790
They probably just wanted to tell us

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.750
what happened to Jibei King.

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:41.750
They didn't want to hurt us.

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:43.840
Fu Sheng is probably being taken somewhere else

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.790
to perform again.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:45.480
Right.

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:47.830
Gu Tian is right.

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:49.230
That's what I think.

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:53.710
Let's keep looking.

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:54.390
Okay.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:58.920
Fu Sheng.

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:07.870
How is he?

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:09.480
He's very weak.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.790
It's probably because he was in such a hurry

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.290
and the miasma poison hurt his heart.

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:19.710
Boy, don't blame me.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.600
It's your choice.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:23.710
Take him away.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.390
OK.

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:49.670
Where is this place?

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:54.670
There are people here.

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:55.830
Get them.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.080
Go.

00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.830
Be careful.

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:08.830
Why just you guys?

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:13.710
Where's Fu Sheng?

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.390
What's it to you?

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.960
My Lord.

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:22.040
Fu Sheng was captured by some masked men.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.520
Why aren't you dead yet?

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:26.350
My Lord.

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.080
My life is yours.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.350
If you don't let me die,

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:30.560
I dare not.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.390
You are finally willing to come out.

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:02.600
Su Rang.

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:05.560
There's one last good show.

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.440
Don't you want to watch it?

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:10.480
Okay.

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:12.560
I want to see

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:14.480

Liu Luan, don't blame me.

It's Su Rang's fault.

Don't give the wrong name

I got it.

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:46.230
That guy outside isn't the real Jibei King,

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.870
right?

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:49.120
I saw a man named Zhu

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:51.080
change Jibei King's face

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.440
in the illusion,

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:56.930
so you four

00:43:57.330 --> 00:43:58.920
are Jibei King's men.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:11.830
Why them?

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:14.600
Madam, what's wrong?

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:15.920
I know all these people.

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.350
The man on the far right

00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:19.870
with the scar on his face is Wang Huangyu,

00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:22.160
the former Royal Army commander.

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:25.600
Beside him is Liu Yuan, the guard of the King's sons.

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.710
The rest of them should be Liu's clan members.

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:29.960
Aren't these people all royal clansmen

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:32.000
who once held high positions?

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:33.230
Why are they here?

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:36.400
I thought you guys were somebodies.

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:38.870
You're just a bunch of wild ghosts

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.520

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:54.120
Isn't he your strength against me?

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:08.170
It was a mistake

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:10.490
for me to let you go twenty years ago.

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:13.740
