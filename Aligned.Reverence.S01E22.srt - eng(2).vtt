(I want to stand equal to heaven)

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.980
It seems I am not the only one who wants
to interrogate Prince Yu tonight.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.820
I will go find out more.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.340
He is not dead, is he?

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.260
I knew what to do.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.900
Yan.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.539
What happened?

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.740
Leave quickly.

00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:43.095
Pretend you were never here.

00:02:43.112 --> 00:02:45.992
I am now framed as the killer
who poisoned Prince Yu.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.580
Go now.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.580
Unless you explain everything,
I will not leave.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.300
Yuan,

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.500
the one who caused the downfall
of the entire Xiao family

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.060
is the Emperor.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.300
Your Majesty.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.579
I knew you

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.420
would definitely protect me.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.580
You are wrong.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.500
As of today,

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.620
no one can protect you.

00:03:27.087 --> 00:03:28.847
Do not worry.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.540
The Nanyue poison

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.940
will ensure you have a quick death.

00:03:38.812 --> 00:03:39.799
Your Majesty.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.139
You cannot kill me.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.339
You must not kill me!

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.700
If you kill me, I will...

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.860
Your Majesty.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.860
Why?

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.100
Have you forgotten

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.660
that I was the one who helped you
poison our father back then?

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.780
Otherwise, this throne

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.620
would have belonged
to Prince Duan long ago.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.700
Therefore,

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.980
both you and the Xiao family

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.860
must die.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.260
So that is the truth.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.180
It was you

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.419
who colluded with Nanyue
to frame the Xiao family,

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.499
wasn't it?

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.674
In fact,

00:04:52.675 --> 00:04:54.555
you had already colluded
with Nanyue long ago.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.480
No wonder as soon
as our Imperial Father died,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.940
Nanyue launched an attack.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.860
What a meticulous scheme.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.420
First, you used me
to eliminate the Xiao family,

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.380
and then you used Xie Yunyan
to eliminate me!

00:05:16.425 --> 00:05:17.819
Do you think

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.260
if I die,

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.259
no one will know

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.220
about your dirty deeds?

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.620
I will be waiting for you
in the afterlife.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.420
The Xiao family's private seal,

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.540
the Edict of Succession...

00:06:10.437 --> 00:06:11.837
The private seal...

00:06:13.562 --> 00:06:14.682
The Edict...

00:06:45.825 --> 00:06:46.985
Dare to fight me?

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.700
Xie Yunyan

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.260
poisoned Prince Yu.

00:06:59.312 --> 00:07:01.592
Prince Yu retaliated before his death

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.260
and wounded Xie Yunyan.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.757
He was captured
on the spot by the guards.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.060
Xie Yunyan,

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.700
if you want the elderly, weak,

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.780
women, and children
of the Xiao family to live,

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.420
confess your crime obediently.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.140
The Xiao family's private seal

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.739
is related to the
late Emperor's Edict of Succession.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.900
That is why the Emperor caused the
destruction of the entire Xiao family.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:46.860
Yuan,

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.980
he is the Emperor.

00:07:52.487 --> 00:07:54.407
The Xiao family cannot defeat him.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.259
Only if I die

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.780
will you all be safe.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.779
Protect Grandmother and the others.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:02.782
Go.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.100
Yan,

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.449
hiding and backing down will not help.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.010
As long as the Edict of Succession
remains a threat,

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.220
the Emperor will never
let the Xiao family go.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.757
What are you going to do?

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.140
Xie Yunyan,

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.780
promise me

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:32.940
you will not confess.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.180
Stay alive.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.440
Wait for me to come back
and save you.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:42.970
Yuan.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.100
(Xie Yunyan.)

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.420
(I always thought it was
because you acted so drastically)

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.820
(that in the last life)

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.870
(you became so cynical)

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.260
(and chose to ruin the world.)

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.407
Slaughter all
the wicked officials in court

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.620
to honor the heroes of my Xiao family.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.140
(Now I understand,)

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.380
(it was the Qing Emperor
who twisted right and wrong,)

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.900
(allowing monsters and evil spirits
to run rampant in this world,)

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:17.140
(making good people stepping stones
and paving bones.)

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.179
(But I insist on justice being served)

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.980
(and all grievances settled.)

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.060
(Xie Yunyan,)

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.260
(I want to set the world right.)

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.499
(Xiao Ancestral Hall)

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.620
Yuan,

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.579
why did you wake us up

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.500
in the middle of the night?

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.740
Where is Yan?

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.220
I remember you two returned together
from the court.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.220
Grandmother, Mother,

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.330
tonight you must leave
the capital to avoid disaster.

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.570
Heir Qi will help.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.302
Avoid disaster? What disaster
are you talking about?

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.020
The Emperor

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.820
is the one who murdered the Xiao family.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:02.161
Tonight,

00:10:02.162 --> 00:10:03.980
he is framing Yan again

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.740
for poisoning Prince Yu.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:11.374
He is using the lives of everyone
in the Xiao family to force Yan to confess.

00:10:11.375 --> 00:10:12.895
What?

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.500
Mother.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.019
I will

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.299
explain the details after I

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.340
rescue Yan.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.500
However, this undertaking is perilous.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.020
I can only act freely

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.180
once you have left.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.619
Saving him is urgent.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.259
This is not the time to talk.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.340
Go quickly and prepare to leave.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:32.900
Alright.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.020
Yuan,

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.580
do you already have a plan?

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.340
I want to set the world right.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.220
Young Lady Su,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.082
this is indeed shocking.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:16.620
Tonight,

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.340
I was never here.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.220
Is it not a little late

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.820
for Your Lordship to withdraw now?

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.420
Are you trying to implicate me?

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.020
Did Your Lordship not ask Luo

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.660
to seek justice for the Xiao family?

00:11:44.887 --> 00:11:46.927
Therefore, saving Xie Yunyan

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.020
is something you must do.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.300
Su Jinyuan, are you out of your mind?

00:11:51.712 --> 00:11:53.792
Tell me how to save him.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.260
Are we to storm the imperial prison
or raid the execution ground?

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:57.960
How many lives do you have to waste?

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:58.899
You know what I mean.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:11:59.819
Naive.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.699
Without a just cause,

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.100
we will only become rebels scorned
by the entire world.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.820
Tonight, I learned
an earth-shattering secret.

00:12:09.375 --> 00:12:12.295
The late Emperor
was killed by Prince Yu.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.900
That is how the current Emperor
seized his opportunity.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.020
In those years,

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.379
Prince Duan, as the crown prince,

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.020
was nonetheless kept from the throne.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.680
I know you harbor resentment,

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.080
and have been secretly plotting
and preparing for a long time.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.700
If we have the late Emperor's Edict,

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.259
and in addition,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.300
evidence of his tyrannical
and unworthy actions,

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.220
Your Lordship,

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.340
will you not have a just cause to act?

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.220
Is that true?

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.899
I once promised my late husband

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.019
(Memorial Tablet of Xiao Jin)

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:17.060
that I would take this secret
with me to my grave.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:19.660
Back then,

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:24.420
my late husband, Xiao Yingting,
and the late Emperor were like brothers.

00:13:24.812 --> 00:13:25.932
At that time,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.980
the late Emperor was worried

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.979
that his sons harbored ambitions
for the throne.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:34.780
So he prepared an Edict of Succession
for the Crown Prince early on.

00:13:35.037 --> 00:13:38.620
It was locked in the Ancestral Temple,
on the main beam.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.300
The key

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.780
was the private seal of Xiao family.

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.660
Later, when Nanyue invaded,

00:13:52.012 --> 00:13:53.619
the Crown Prince led the army to battle,

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.660
but the late Emperor
suddenly passed away.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:00.332
By the time the Crown Prince
and my late husband rushed back,

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:01.940
the current Emperor

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.700
had already ascended the throne.

00:14:05.062 --> 00:14:07.382
To appoint someone else at that moment

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.540
would certainly have plunged
the world into chaos.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.780
My late husband had no choice
but to let the matter stand

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.086
and warned me

00:14:16.087 --> 00:14:17.807
to keep the matter of the Edict

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.460
secret forever.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.740
Yet, even this could not escape
the Emperor's suspicion.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:35.940
The Xiao family

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:38.930
was ultimately ruined and destroyed.

00:14:42.225 --> 00:14:46.632
(Memorial Tablet of Xiao Jin,
Xiao Yunxi, Xiao Yunxin)

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.340
May I ask, Grand Madam,

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.020
where is the private seal now?

00:15:01.887 --> 00:15:03.007
Yuan,

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.220
take off your headpiece, the one symbolizing
your authority over the family.

00:15:35.962 --> 00:15:37.082
No wonder.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.880
They searched everywhere but couldn't
find the Xiao family's private seal.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.780
It was hidden in this hairpin all along.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.540
Your Lordship,

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.380
now,

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.020
are you willing to raise an army?
