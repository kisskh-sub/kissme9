(Adapted from the Jinjiang Novel
"Sniper Butterfly" by author Qibaosu)

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.180
=Episode 27=

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.733
(Today you will have flowers
and the moon.)

00:01:57.733 --> 00:01:58.980
(Wish you happiness.)

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.410
(Are you free tonight?)

00:02:09.466 --> 00:02:11.240
(Would you honor me
by having dinner together?)

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.940
(Mr. Li.)

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.220
Right.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.380
What are you doing?

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.010
You scared me, Jun.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.690
What are you doing?

00:02:44.444 --> 00:02:46.680
My mom has been staying
at my place at night lately.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.460
She checks on me.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.180
I have to prepare in advance.

00:02:50.533 --> 00:02:52.380
Do you know
what you look like right now?

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.380
What?

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.910
You look exactly like a scumbag

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.460
lying to his wife about working late.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.970
I'm being forced, okay?

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.840
All scumbags

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.940
seem to say that.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.940
I'm really defeated by you.

00:03:06.111 --> 00:03:07.460
Being in love really is different.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.190
The client's feedback

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.750
keeps coming again and again.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.290
Everyone outside is exhausted.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.710
Only you

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.290
are calm and sweet here.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.340
It's enviable.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.910
It's the app reminding me

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.620
to have a good mood today.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.180
What app is that?

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.130
Another toxic positive quote?

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.460
You don't understand.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:31.250
Right.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.470
Of course, I don't.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.440
Do you know what my phone
reminds me of every day?

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.380
My phone reminds me
about the parents' group

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.340
from my kid's teacher every day.

00:03:38.622 --> 00:03:39.780
A few days ago, they said

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.410
a placement test is coming soon.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.620
We must help our kids review.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.900
And today,

00:03:45.644 --> 00:03:46.909
another message saying

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.560
that the kid didn't do well.
Is it because

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.870
parents are too busy working

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.130
and didn't review with them?

00:03:51.555 --> 00:03:53.000
My god. I've been studying with her

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.977
until midnight every day.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.500
My head is about to explode.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.470
So, I'm telling you,

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.310
enjoy your romance while you can.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.970
Okay?

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.010
I need to go pick up my kid.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.910
You go on dating.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:04.460
I'm leaving.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.190
Thank you, Jun.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.900
Bye.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.444
(Okay. I'll pick you up at seven.)

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.140
(Okay.)

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.580
(I'll pick you up at seven.)

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.140
(Yi City Xingguang Technology)

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.820
Hello.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.930
How's the talk going?

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.140
I haven't even seen them yet.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.610
Still haven't met them?

00:04:57.044 --> 00:04:58.360
You've waited all afternoon, right?

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.866
What kind of meeting lasts this long?

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.510
This company

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.930
is very popular lately.

00:05:04.555 --> 00:05:05.659
It's already good enough

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.830
that they agreed to meet us.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.430
We're begging to cooperate with them.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.260
So just wait.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.930
Alright.

00:05:12.555 --> 00:05:13.900
Things are a mess on my side, too.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.270
Just let me know

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.100
if anything happens.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.170
Okay.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.100
Thanks.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.260
Well...

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.800
May I ask

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.850
what time Mr. Zhang's meeting
will roughly end?

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.920
Well...

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.970
I'm not really sure.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.240
Okay.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.820
Thank you.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.430
(I might)

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.780
(need to work late tonight.)

00:05:57.022 --> 00:05:58.711
(There's something I need to handle.)

00:05:59.044 --> 00:06:00.977
(Let's meet directly at the restaurant.)

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.340
(Did something happen?)

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.820
(No.)

00:06:20.066 --> 00:06:21.140
(Just a small issue.)

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.750
Sister.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.820
Brother says being late was his fault.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.930
He wants you not to be mad.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.290
Thank you.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.830
Then, help me tell brother

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.000
that I'm not angry.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.310
Okay?

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:04.920
Okay.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.530
Thank you.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.240
I still remember

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:21.830
the first time

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.260
we had Western food together.

00:07:23.333 --> 00:07:25.311
You didn't even know how
to use a knife and fork.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.100
You just sat there foolishly.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.460
Hello?

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.460
Did you hear what I said?

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.050
What did you say?

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.580
Nothing.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:46.480
Sorry.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.310
I was just thinking
about something else.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.050
I didn't notice.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.260
Thank you.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.160
Are you still worried

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.444
about my mom's attitude?

00:08:01.733 --> 00:08:02.560
This isn't something

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.100
that can be solved in a day or two.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.190
I think

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.820
as long as we stay firm,

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:09.830
and let my mom know

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.260
that we're not acting on impulse,

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.900
she'll eventually be moved.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.040
Besides,

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.730
you're so presentable now,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.260
young and promising.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.600
If you go to People's Park,

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.533
there will be so many mothers
fighting over you.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.310
By then,

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.711
she'd have to hold onto you tightly.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:27.920
When did you ever

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.930
go to People's Park?

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:32.820
For blind dates?

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.420
I was just curious.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.130
I went with Chun Chang
to join the crowd.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.370
How was it?

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.010
As expected,

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:48.300
I was very popular.

00:09:03.222 --> 00:09:04.777
I'm going out to take a call.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.820
Hello, Jie.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:12.700
Li Wu.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:14.420
I'm really sorry.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:15.600
Actually,

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.955
I wanted to act as a middleman,

00:09:16.955 --> 00:09:17.890
to connect you two.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.770
You're both solid companies.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.120
If you could work together,

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.355
it would be great for everyone.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:22.940
It's okay.

00:09:23.644 --> 00:09:24.720
Just being willing to help me

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.177
is already something I'm grateful for.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:27.120
I guess

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.610
their company is very busy lately.

00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:30.066
It's the end of the year after all.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.440
Many projects for next year

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.890
have already been finalized.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:33.750
At this stage,

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.080
finding new partners

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.060
is indeed difficult.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.010
Yes.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.730
But no matter how hard it is,

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.940
I still have to try.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.840
Actually, there's another company

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.755
that's very interested
in your CloudMap system,

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.490
especially in your R&D technology.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.650
They've even expressed interest
in investing.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.370
Which company?

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:53.130
Kejun.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.720
Actually, this company

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.390
is also a veteran

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:57.540
in the tech industry.

00:09:57.555 --> 00:09:59.688
Their latest products
have been quite well received.

00:09:59.688 --> 00:10:02.150
The CEO even asked me

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.100
to reach out to you.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.060
Sorry.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.850
But we won't take
a single cent from Kejun.

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:12.010
Jie.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.480
You've already helped me a lot,

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.630
and I'm very grateful.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:17.250
But,

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.370
when it comes to Kejun,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.340
we will never work with them.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.940
I'll look for other options.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:33.770
Okay.

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:09.000
It's so hot.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.890
Let's take a taxi.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:12.460
We're very close to home.

00:11:12.488 --> 00:11:13.580
Let's walk a little more.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.750
My hands are sweating.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.250
Don't you feel they're sticky?

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.850
Isn't it uncomfortable?

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.010
Not for me.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:27.490
You're so clingy.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:29.940
Well...

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.730
Do you

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.220
find it annoying?

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.010
A little.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.220
I'm joking with you.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:44.670
Did something

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.580
happen today?

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:49.420
Is your company in trouble?

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.180
Nothing serious.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:56.060
Just...

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.540
a small bug.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.630
I can handle it.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:02.820
I just need some time.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.390
Didn't you say you hate sweating?

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:13.420
Isn't it uncomfortable?

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.220
But I didn't tell you to let go.

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:18.940
Okay, then.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:19.940
As you command.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:33.370
I'm heading back now.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.540
Can you stay at my place tonight?

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.180
My mom's home. It's inconvenient.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:42.220
Just for a little while?

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.370
Just a little while, okay?

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.010
Be good.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:56.180
My phone.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.770
Elevator.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.610
You really can't come to my place?

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.360
Nonsense.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.270
Didn't you see?

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:14.770
My heart almost jumped out.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:18.370
Fine.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:21.650
Be good.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:31.420
Cen Jin.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.610
Do you love me?

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:41.820
What's with you today?

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.250
It's nothing.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.420
Just kidding.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.240
Just in case, take the stairs.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.060
We'll split up.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.700
And...

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.100
I love you.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:44.720
(How's the issue)

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.977
(with the bug coming along?)

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:29.130
(It's almost fixed.)

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.100
(Don't worry.)

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.540
Hello.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:43.890
Where are you?

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.340
Almost there. Thirty minutes.

00:15:46.555 --> 00:15:48.420
This company was really hard
to book today.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:50.200
Hurry over. I'll start the meeting.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:50.650
Okay.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.580
(It's almost fixed. Don't worry.)

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.790
A few new babies

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:42.390
just entered my livestream.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:43.730
Let me repeat this again.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:45.580
Anyway,

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.130
if someone

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.320
sends you a message

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.800
saying "What are you doing?",

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.250
it means they miss you.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.080
Old viewers of my livestream

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.080
should know

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.000
that we have
a few forbidden phrases, like,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:58.715
"I'm at work."

00:16:58.730 --> 00:16:59.688
"I'm working overtime."

00:16:59.688 --> 00:17:00.377
"Let's eat."

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:01.820
You should instead say,

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.070
"I'm eating something delicious alone."

00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:04.980
"It's so good."

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.030
"Hopefully next time

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.500
I can take you to eat it too."

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:08.880
That way,

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.340
you keep the conversation going.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.890
Also, look at their attitude.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.610
If they follow along with the topic,

00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:16.830
then it means

00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:18.690
they're curious about your life.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.310
Then, you can follow along

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:21.260
and ask them something.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.740
From their attitude...

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:32.400
Delicious grapes.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.370
Fans get the first bite.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.580
They're pretty good.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:42.240
That's it

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.260
for today's livestream.

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:44.880
Next time, I'll share

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.480
my favorite daily items.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.930
See you next time, bye!

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.850
It's over?

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.690
No wonder my mom always says

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.740
my place looks like a doghouse.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.060
It really is much cleaner now.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.540
Thank you, Honey.

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:12.820
Oh, right.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:14.820
I have something to give you.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:15.780
What is it?

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.060
What?

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.000
Last month,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.450
I discovered a small asteroid.

00:18:24.622 --> 00:18:25.510
The observation data

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:26.844
have already been submitted.

00:18:26.844 --> 00:18:28.244
The International Astronomical Union

00:18:28.244 --> 00:18:29.333
has confirmed it as well.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.300
This is its temporary number.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:32.590
Next,

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:33.680
as long as we observe

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.930
four more return cycles,

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.370
we'll gain the naming rights.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.450
Can we name it with our own names?

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:44.310
So you have to stay with me

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.980
through the remaining cycles.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:55.850
Is this it?

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:00.450
It should be in this direction.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.300
(Jie: Kejun still wants to
meet you guys.)

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.410
(They seem sincere.)

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.610
(Why not meet them once?)

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.270
Mr. Li.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:40.210
Sorry to interrupt.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:42.020
What is it?

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:46.540
What's wrong?

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.680
I need to report something.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.210
The company barely has money left.

00:19:50.333 --> 00:19:51.780
We can't make next month's payroll.

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:00.210
Does Mr. Cheng know?

00:20:00.377 --> 00:20:01.480
I haven't seen him today.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.850
I texted him, but no reply.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.410
Okay.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.170
It's fine.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.300
You go ahead. I'll think of something.

00:20:09.377 --> 00:20:10.800
Alright, I'll get back to work.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.260
Hello.

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:58.060
Wu.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:03.030
Help me ask

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.550
how much my car

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:05.370
can sell for now?

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.680
The remaining money

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.450
will arrive within three working days.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:12.480
Okay.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.020
Thanks.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:13.844
You're welcome.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:33.820
Hello.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:36.820
Are you at the company?

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.410
I won't make it to the company.

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:41.020
I'm at the hospital.

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.930
What?

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:52.920
Okay, I think it's almost done.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.740
Proofread it a few more times
before sending.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.300
Ugh, uncomfortable.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:07.170
Drink a few more bottles.

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.340
Maybe two negatives make a positive.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.580
Don't look at me like that.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:14.980
You're making me nervous.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:18.370
I really had no choice.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.480
If I didn't keep them company

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.540
and make them happy,

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.070
how would they be willing

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:23.850
to invest in us?

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.060
Besides,

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:27.060
Li Wu is under huge pressure now.

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:29.690
I have to help him
carry the load, right?

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:46.020
What?

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.130
You gonna provide for me?

00:22:49.711 --> 00:22:50.955
My mom said when we buy a house,

00:22:50.977 --> 00:22:52.880
your family can't pay for everything.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.210
So she gave me a down payment.

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.890
How much?

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:57.540
One million yuan.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:00.690
That much?

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:02.500
I can't accept it.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.170
Besides,

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.100
I haven't even told my family.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:07.310
How can I take your money?

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.070
I told you to take it, so take it.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:10.980
Let me ask you.
Do you have any other solution?

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:13.690
Just not at the moment.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:14.890
But I will...

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.980
Listen, Cheng Rui.

00:23:17.111 --> 00:23:18.440
If you ever again risk your life

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.890
and drink for money

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:21.590
or come up with

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:22.960
some shady loan idea,

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.370
then forget about our wedding.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.210
I swear I never will.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:34.980
Here's the deal.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.030
If in the end,

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:37.980
I really can't solve it,

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.100
we'll consider using your money.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.210
Keep it for now.

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:51.890
Sir.

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:53.410
Are you here to visit a patient?

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.020
It's fine.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:57.890
I'm not.

00:24:08.111 --> 00:24:09.740
I still have something to do today.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.820
I won't come by.

00:24:10.844 --> 00:24:12.060
I'll visit you in a few days.

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:14.580
Leave the rest to me.

00:24:14.622 --> 00:24:15.622
Don't worry about it.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:32.740
(Jie: Kejun)

00:24:32.844 --> 00:24:34.130
(still wants to meet you guys.)

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:35.450
(They seem sincere.)

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:37.580
(Why not meet them once?)

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:53.410
Okay.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.300
Let's find a time this week

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:57.580
and talk.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:19.340
Get in.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:20.820
Why?

00:25:21.222 --> 00:25:22.300
I'm taking you to elope.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.500
Taking me to elope?

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:51.260
So?

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:52.890
This place is beautiful, right?

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:55.980
It's beautiful.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:05.030
Your company

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.533
has run into trouble lately, right?

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:27.100
(Intelligent Environmental System
Live Launch Event)

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.533
Still trying to hide it from me?

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.340
Actually,

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.440
it's not that big of a problem.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.260
Just a bug.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:43.110
That bug

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:44.030
has already been fixed.

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:45.355
So it's not a big deal anymore.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.590
I didn't tell you

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:50.911
because I didn't want you to worry.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.170
Your acting is kind of bad.

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:57.580
If you ever switch careers,

00:26:58.030 --> 00:26:59.500
you won't make it as an actor.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.820
Such a waste of that face.

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.130
Yi went to Kejun.

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:12.750
At your company's stage,

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:14.540
a co-founder quitting

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.690
isn't exactly good news.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.980
Plus, these days,

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.020
you frown

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.650
every single day like a twisted rope.

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:30.740
I figured it wasn't that simple.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.100
Tell me.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.070
Yi took our

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.070
first-gen CloudMap system

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.930
and went to Kejun.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.060
Our investors

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.300
immediately demanded withdrawal.

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:51.170
We originally

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:54.260
wanted to file a lawsuit.

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:56.890
However...

00:27:58.533 --> 00:28:00.244
It's time-consuming and costly.

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:03.780
Besides,

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:05.240
to keep the system

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.060
able to launch,

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:06.920
we still have

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.288
to keep making new adjustments.

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:11.410
And that's another huge R&D cost.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:18.690
If we still can't find funding...

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:30.500
Probably...

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:34.740
The company won't last much longer.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:40.500
Come on.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.300
Li Wu.

00:28:46.644 --> 00:28:48.000
Facing difficulties in startups

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.300
is completely normal.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.450
It doesn't mean you're not capable.

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.790
I've seen

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:56.260
the light in your eyes.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.130
Why now that you've hit

00:28:58.270 --> 00:28:59.450
a bit of a setback,

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.370
your sharpness has disappeared?

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:07.340
Because...

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:12.650
Because...

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:15.850
I didn't want you to know.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.450
If I fail,

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:24.610
maybe...

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.070
I won't even have the right

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:31.000
to give you happiness.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.270
So you quietly

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:42.540
carried all this by yourself.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.500
Even considering accepting

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:47.060
unreasonable demands.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:48.930
That's all for me?

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:53.890
I...

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.890
If you really

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:00.500
gave up things

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.410
you believe in because of me,

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.640
that would only become

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.170
a ticking time bomb between us.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.450
Until the day it explodes,

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:09.650
you'll blame

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.680
that if not because of me,

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:12.980
you would never have done that.

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:23.060
You're right.

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.540
I really

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:27.550
never actually thought

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:28.890
about whether you wanted these.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:30.690
It's just...

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:33.310
I wanted

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:34.980
to earn the right to stand beside you.

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:42.500
Thank you.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.890
I'm very happy.

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:45.340
Really.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.580
But I want you to know,

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.510
my happiness

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:55.410
does not depend on your achievements.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.610
How successful you are

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.440
and whether we can stay together

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.410
are two different things.

00:31:02.755 --> 00:31:04.000
Let me put it this way.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.580
You are you, and I am me.

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:07.920
We are simply two people together

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.690
because we are attracted to each other.

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:12.550
So we don't need all those

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:14.440
fancy rules and restrictions.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.350
No need for matching backgrounds

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:17.540
or going hand in hand.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:20.790
We should be

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:22.170
each other's most trusted person.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.300
Any self-sacrificial decision

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.720
would actually be

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.260
irresponsible for this relationship.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.510
Of course, this only applies to me.

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:34.000
A lady

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.410
you still like at the moment.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:37.440
If there's another one,

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.540
then that's not my concern.

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.780
There will never be another.

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:48.020
Long time no see, Mr. Li.

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:49.500
Long time no see.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:54.450
I'm late today.

00:32:54.777 --> 00:32:56.177
I'll punish myself with a drink.

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:18.130
I'll take another one.

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:35.210
I didn't expect

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.680
Mr. Li to grace us

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.688
by coming to this meal.

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:39.580
If it were before,

00:33:39.822 --> 00:33:42.190
even with eight sedan chairs,
we couldn't have invited you.

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:02.510
We're all brothers.

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:03.610
You're being too formal.

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:04.820
Sit.

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.630
When Tongchen was at its hardest,

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:17.420
you still extended a hand,
and helped us out.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.500
A great favor needs no thanks.

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:41.860
Then,

00:34:42.044 --> 00:34:43.511
I'll get straight to the point.

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:45.070
Right now, I have

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:45.960
30 percent

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.130
of Tongchen's shares in hand.

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:48.690
I figure you and Cheng Rui

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:50.244
don't have the money to buy them back.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.980
But now Kejun is willing to pay.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.100
You could see it
as an investment in your tech.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.466
You're just short on money, right?

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.980
This counts as timely help.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.770
Kejun is an industry leader.

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:04.770
Being recognized by them,

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.170
of course, is an honor for us.

00:35:09.222 --> 00:35:11.244
Looks like you've already
made up your mind.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.580
People

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:15.940
don't know who they are

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.170
until they go through some hardship.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.920
I thought, with your character,

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.510
you'd act all aloof again.

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:24.580
I was overthinking.

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:27.230
You're well aware

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:28.580
of our situation here.

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:29.760
We have no right

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.770
to be picky anymore.

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:33.020
I'll toast you again.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.060
Li Wu.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.980
Fortunes turn.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.060
You're in a particularly good state now.

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:47.690
Congratulations.

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:32.380
Why are you here?

00:36:33.511 --> 00:36:35.755
What are you doing coming
to this kind of meeting?

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:37.940
Isn't this obvious bullying?

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:39.320
Yi is just

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.230
here to watch us fail.

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:42.022
And you're just giving him
a warm welcome.

00:36:42.711 --> 00:36:44.311
I was so angry that I pulled the syringe

00:36:44.311 --> 00:36:45.355
and rushed over.

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:01.480
(This is)

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.020
(a gift for their first meeting.)

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:08.540
(When I first interacted with them,)

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.550
(I knew they)

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:12.250
(were developing a new system.)

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.650
(But there's one difficult part)

00:37:15.777 --> 00:37:16.860
(he hasn't overcome yet.)

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:20.500
So,

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.111
you're here to fish for info.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.170
Of course.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.730
You are my best brother.

00:37:35.311 --> 00:37:36.570
Tongchen was also established

00:37:36.577 --> 00:37:37.622
by the two of us together.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.060
I definitely

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:44.170
cannot give up.

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:45.420
Then why didn't you...

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:51.190
I rushed over while Wen

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:52.460
was in the bathroom.

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:55.460
There's still half a bottle
of IV drip left.

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:57.420
It makes me so mad.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:03.730
Tomorrow,

00:38:05.733 --> 00:38:06.840
I'll give this recording

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.690
to Lawyer Li.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:09.940
Along with

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.770
Zhang Chenyang's

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:15.030
previous record
of accessing the intranet

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:16.330
and downloading the algorithm.

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.020
Together, these should

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:25.230
be enough to charge them
with trade secret infringement.

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:26.060
Let's sue them.

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:32.170
Alright.

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:35.444
I'll call a designated driver for you.

00:38:35.488 --> 00:38:37.200
You haven't finished your IV yet, right?

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:38.650
Go back and rest properly.

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:40.650
It's already arranged.

00:38:41.422 --> 00:38:42.600
I'll send you off first.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:47.500
Get up.

00:38:49.933 --> 00:38:51.933
You're so drunk.
You can't even walk straight.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.770
It's fine.

00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.580
Hello.

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:01.690
May I ask
who called the designated driver?

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.060
License plate ending 5603.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:04.900
That's me.

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.330
Where's the car?

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:11.540
Where did you park it?

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.860
Where is the car parked?

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:22.060
Where's your car?

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.170
I sold it

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.540
to pay the supplier's final payment.

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.170
Mine's sold, too.

00:39:34.733 --> 00:39:36.533
Just enough
to cover this month's salary.

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:40.100
Then, please cancel it.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:42.290
But the fee still applies.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:43.290
Okay.

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:44.480
Sorry about that.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.020
No problem.

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:46.266
Thanks for the trouble.

00:39:49.466 --> 00:39:51.810
When did you sell the car?

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:20.250
Mrs. Cen...

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:22.610
Li Wu.

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.880
Mom.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:29.760
Li Wu is drunk.

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.810
He can't be left alone.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.730
During this time,

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:36.760
you should know

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:37.900
what's been going on with us.

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:41.770
Are you sure you've
thought this through?

00:40:42.422 --> 00:40:44.210
Aren't you afraid
of what others will say?

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:46.420
We're open and honest,

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:48.210
and haven't done anything shameful.

00:40:49.111 --> 00:40:50.110
I won't say more now.

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:50.730
You sleep first.

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:54.690
Li Wu.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:56.840
Careful.

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:57.650
Why are you out here?

00:40:58.760 --> 00:40:59.170
Come.
