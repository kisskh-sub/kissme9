I hope everyone can actively participate in
international environmental protection

cooperation and exchange,
and bring in advanced technologies.

Why isn't it Li Wu's turn yet?

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.760
It should be him

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.810
after this lady, I guess.

00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:57.600
Isn't he standing right there waiting?

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.150
Thank you

Next, let's welcome Tongchen Technology's CTO,

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.970
Mr. Li Wu.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.810
Thank you.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.955
Hello, everyone.

00:02:21.977 --> 00:02:23.970
I'm Li Wu from Tongchen Technology.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.430
Welcome to

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.630
this AI-themed

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.970
conference.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.800
Today,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.030
we're lucky

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.360
to hear wonderful talks

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.570
from top experts,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.590
entrepreneurs,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.750
and scholars from all over.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.710
We can learn about

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.800
technological innovation

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.840
in AI,

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.800
research progress,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.470
and market applications.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.120
I've personally

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.570
gained a lot as well.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.100
This conference has quite the setup.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.520
Tongchen can finally show up

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.180
at an event of this scale.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.730
Pretty impressive.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.620
Yeah.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.470
Those big names

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.130
we only see in journals are here too.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.250
Li Wu's supervisor
from Penn is also here.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.940
If he can introduce him to us,

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.250
maybe we can collaborate someday.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:16.410
Alright.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.470
That's the example

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.780
of real-time monitoring.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.800
As I mentioned earlier,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.680
regarding a series of data
on air impurity detection

00:03:25.688 --> 00:03:28.010
and carbon dioxide
concentration monitoring.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.810
Please.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.780
Professor Liu.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.970
Li Wu.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.630
You did a great job

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.840
just now.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.500
Not at all.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.780
Professor Liu,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.430
do you have time tonight?

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.010
Maybe we could have dinner together.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.180
Dinner?

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.840
I'm afraid not.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.970
I have a meeting tonight.

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:02.822
How's the technical issue

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.680
we talked about last time?

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.530
Is it solved?

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.850
I haven't had a chance to tell you.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.360
The initial testing

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.080
of our new system

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.190
was a success.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.240
We're now simulating

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.180
different environments.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.240
Besides,

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.755
we're close to securing our Series B.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.050
Pushing forward technically is good,

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.260
but now you're running a company.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.660
Don't be too eager for quick success.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.680
Ambition and confidence

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.700
are good,

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.220
but you have to move one step at a time.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.800
I understand, Professor Liu.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.820
But the problem right now is

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.155
that there are too many companies

00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:39.970
doing the same thing as we are.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.120
Like Kejun

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.820
and Leiyin.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.100
I think

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.390
if we don't pick up

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.240
the pace,

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.490
we'll get eliminated very soon.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.900
Sometimes,

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.580
slow is fast.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.610
I know your personality.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.050
You've always been driven.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.580
Nothing's wrong with that.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.170
But when needed,

00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:02.700
you have to stay humble and patient.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.970
Alright.

00:05:06.977 --> 00:05:08.040
I have a roundtable forum

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.580
the day after tomorrow.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:10.580
Come by

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.780
and learn something.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.460
Sure.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.109
See you then.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.977
Alright.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.610
This way, please.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.140
(Plans changed.)

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.644
(I have to stay one more day.)

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:39.460
Mr. Li,

00:05:39.533 --> 00:05:41.066
mind if we get to know each other?

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.530
Mr. Li,

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.290
look where we are.

00:06:22.871 --> 00:06:23.891
When did you get here?

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.780
When you were giving your speech
on stage.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.360
I didn't expect

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.490
you to look like that on stage.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.610
What did I look like?

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.370
You looked pretty handsome.

00:06:47.977 --> 00:06:48.580
Hey.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.720
I didn't expect

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.630
to run into you here.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:10.580
Wen!

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:13.700
Alright then.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.100
Okay. See you.

00:07:30.311 --> 00:07:32.000
Who told you to call me by my nickname

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.170
in a place like this?

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.580
When did you come back?

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.140
Why are you here?

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:38.870
I got here this morning.

00:07:38.911 --> 00:07:40.266
I was sent back for an interview.

00:07:40.266 --> 00:07:41.155
You didn't tell me.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:42.460
I could've picked you up.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.530
I'm your lawful husband, you know.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.260
If I told you in advance,

00:07:50.888 --> 00:07:52.044
how would I get to see

00:07:52.066 --> 00:07:53.355
that amazing expression of yours?

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:55.580
So...

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.260
You did come back to surprise me.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.630
Actually, this time,

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.240
the company wants me to take charge of

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.580
the new journal project in Yi City.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:06.870
Really?

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:07.970
Keep your voice down.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:10.630
I haven't gotten the official email yet.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.355
If you don't want me to come back...

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.660
That's great!

00:08:16.355 --> 00:08:18.370
We finally won't have to
do long-distance anymore.

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:45.822
Do you want to try this?

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.730
Forget it.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.340
Hearing what you said on stage today,

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:00.610
I was actually moved.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:02.580
Which part?

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.610
About the future.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.240
If your CloudMap system

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.890
upgrades successfully,

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.490
it'll be very meaningful.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.960
Your system is called CloudMap

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.460
because of Yunfeng Village, right?

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.100
CloudMap carries the meaning
of Yunfeng Village's view.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.100
I knew it.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.700
Yunfeng Village is really beautiful.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:29.300
It is.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.240
When I was a kid,

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.510
life there

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.320
wasn't easy,

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.850
and I went through a lot,

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.370
but...

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.240
When I think back now,

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.644
most of it is still good memories.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.060
Actually, when I think
of Yunfeng Village,

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.730
I can still picture

00:09:46.155 --> 00:09:48.266
the insects chirping,
the shadows of the trees,

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.010
the sunsets and sunrises I saw...

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.180
And you.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:58.150
Those memories

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:59.360
have stayed with me,

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.100
and they healed me

00:10:02.133 --> 00:10:03.911
when I was going through
the toughest time.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.010
So I really hope

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.030
more places

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:08.270
can be like Yunfeng Village

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.300
in my heart.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:10.610
Clean,

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:11.890
beautiful,

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:13.850
and healing.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:17.000
That's why you chose

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.100
AI environment protection, right?

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.010
I think

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.100
you've achieved some of it.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.490
I'll keep working hard.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.000
Right, what app

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.120
did you install on my phone?

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.120
I can't find it anywhere.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.120
Of course, you can't.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.060
I made it myself.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.010
You made it?

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.460
What's it for?

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.890
Well...

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:45.340
Good things, obviously.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.370
Good thing?

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.580
Teach me how to use it.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.360
It doesn't need

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.300
anything special.

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:54.390
I just set up

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.970
a series of commands.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.580
It'll send those prompts to you.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:58.790
And my app

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.540
will get notifications, too.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:03.730
Mr. Li Wu,

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:05.440
you installed an app on my phone

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.580
without my permission.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.000
Are you trying to steal

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:08.850
my info?

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.870
I wouldn't dare.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.080
I just thought it'd be easier

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.340
to check on things.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.220
You enter what you need,

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:17.610
it alerts me,

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:19.340
and I can help you get it done.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.300
That's all.

00:11:22.888 --> 00:11:23.890
I'll trust you for now.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.080
But aren't you

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.820
giving yourself a problem?

00:11:29.955 --> 00:11:31.488
What if you can't follow through?

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:32.420
I will.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:33.820
You said

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.370
you don't need intentional surprises.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.820
I respect that.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.610
This is something I can do,

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.890
and I want to do.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.080
So I turned those surprises

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.650
into little helps

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:48.970
that can

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.220
make your life easier.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:52.340
Are you happy?

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:53.940
I am.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:56.910
Can this app

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:57.970
keep running forever?

00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:59.550
Yes.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.150
I set it to run

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.490
for a hundred years.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.030
A hundred years?

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.240
We won't live that long.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.370
It's fine.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.100
Anyway,

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:11.440
this program

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.960
is made just for you.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.940
It only serves you.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.130
Same as me.

00:12:24.155 --> 00:12:26.250
Since you're already thinking about
a hundred years,

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.111
have you thought about

00:12:28.133 --> 00:12:29.644
what your future will look like?

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:31.370
I have.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:33.580
For example,

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:35.720
when I'm thirty,

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.130
I want my career to be more stable.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.480
When everything

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.970
is more settled,

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:42.650
I'll be able to give you what you want,

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.370
and then I'll deserve to be with you.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:50.300
Why does this sound like

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.730
you're pitching to an investor?

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.890
I'm serious.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.250
I'll keep my word.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.300
There's nothing for sure.

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:04.750
The only constant in life

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:05.770
is change.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.730
It's normal for you to change.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.440
You don't need

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.510
to set

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:11.730
a specific goal for yourself.

00:13:11.755 --> 00:13:12.870
Other people don't have to.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:13.610
I do.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.820
Why?

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.770
I just want you to know

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.730
you're great enough.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.155
You don't have to put

00:13:28.177 --> 00:13:29.400
so much pressure on yourself.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:32.700
Got it?

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.490
Let's talk about this later.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:44.200
Right now,

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.955
we have something more important to do.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.130
What is it?

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:50.250
Shopping.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:51.340
A date.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.777
(Liu Ziqi, Zhang Minting)

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.020
(We're getting married!
You're cordially invited.)

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.540
(Bride: Zhang Minting)

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:31.460
What's that?

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.370
A wedding invitation.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.730
A client I worked with before
sent this.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:36.940
Are you going?

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.220
I heard Wu Fu works with her, too.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.250
He'll probably be there.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.700
So I'm not going.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.460
He'll probably

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.550
dress up more

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:48.820
than the groom.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:50.870
Might even show up

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.220
with a date.

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:54.250
I'll pass.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:56.490
Why not?

00:14:57.066 --> 00:14:58.250
You don't have a boyfriend?

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.300
I can go with you.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.960
Of course, I have a boyfriend.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.060
I just think

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:05.270
we don't need to

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.060
waste time on this.

00:15:06.422 --> 00:15:07.844
I'll give her a call, send my wishes,

00:15:07.844 --> 00:15:09.555
and give a gift.
That should be good enough.

00:15:15.266 --> 00:15:16.370
I'm going to the bathroom.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.340
Hello?

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.010
Hello, Cen Jin.

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.550
You have to come to my wedding.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:40.340
We worked so well together.

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:41.870
We closed so many deals,

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:42.960
and I kept getting promoted.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.390
Really,

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:44.850
you're my lucky star.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:47.360
You missed my first wedding,

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.888
but you must come to my second wedding.

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:51.120
Of course, I want to go,

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.150
but I can't confirm

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:53.130
the date yet.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.420
Oh, please, don't do this to me.

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:57.030
Just come.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.720
I'll put you

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.030
at a table with connections.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.320
There'll be all the resources

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:00.910
you might need.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:02.150
I'll arrange them together

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.970
for you.

00:16:03.044 --> 00:16:04.644
How does that sound? Isn't it wonderful?

00:16:04.666 --> 00:16:05.866
Am I a good work partner?

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:07.730
Don't turn me down.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.120
Alright.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.970
Since you're insisting so much,
I'll be there.

00:16:11.111 --> 00:16:12.777
But don't make any special arrangements.

00:16:12.822 --> 00:16:13.960
If you do, I won't go.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.000
Okay.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:15.911
That's settled then.

00:16:15.955 --> 00:16:18.120
Anyway, you call the shots.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:18.750
Alright,

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:19.550
see you then.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:20.130
Bye-bye.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:37.940
Mom.

00:16:39.266 --> 00:16:40.800
How many times have I told you?

00:16:40.844 --> 00:16:42.044
You don't have to do all these.

00:16:42.044 --> 00:16:43.300
Your hands will crack.

00:16:43.488 --> 00:16:45.466
- Where's the hand cream I bought you?
- It's fine.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.650
Chang.

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:49.730
Well...

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.340
I...

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.060
What is it?

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.220
I bought a train ticket
for tomorrow morning.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.270
Yuan had some trouble at school.

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:57.770
I...

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:03.460
Chang,

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.110
Mr. Zhang is on a business trip.

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.720
He's not home.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.610
There's no one at home.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:12.410
Chang.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:28.000
I'm heading out.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:28.790
I'll be back late.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:29.550
You can leave

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:30.400
anytime you want.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.130
Wait, Chang.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.060
Wait.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:33.690
Hear me out.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:36.020
This time's different.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:38.650
Yuan got into a fight at school.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.410
He hurt someone.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.540
I can't let Mr. Zhang

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.780
find out.

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:46.690
You don't need to explain it.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.450
Taking care of your son is your job.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.610
I just don't get it.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.650
Why is it that every year,

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.100
on my dad's death anniversary,

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:57.890
you always have something going on?

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:02.340
All these years,

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:04.890
how many times
have you gone to his grave?

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:07.890
Did he treat you badly
when he was alive?

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.650
I know.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.500
I know you resent me.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:21.650
Yes,

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:23.610
Mr. Zhang and I

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:24.820
are a hurdle

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.740
you can't get past emotionally.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.060
But...

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:29.310
If it hadn't been

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:30.690
for him,

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.740
this family would've fallen apart.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.650
I was on my own,

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:36.300
with no job.

00:18:36.311 --> 00:18:38.155
How was I supposed to
pay your tuition fee

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.750
or raise you?

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.890
Stop guilt-tripping me.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.500
All these years,

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:46.640
how much have you actually

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.100
been part of my life?

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.640
Do you truly

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.020
care about me?

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:52.400
Do I have a place

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.020
in your so-called home?

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.260
Lotus root pork soup again.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.270
Your new son likes it.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.820
But that doesn't mean I do.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.850
Do you know I hate lotus root?

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:06.980
You don't know.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:08.650
And you don't care either.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.510
No matter how many times I've said it,

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:13.030
my bowl is always filled

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.450
with the thing I hate the most.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:15.930
You...

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.020
Excuse me.

00:19:47.777 --> 00:19:49.550
One more dapanji, please.
[*Spicy chicken stew]

00:19:49.555 --> 00:19:50.210
Sure.

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:55.110
Mr. Shen,

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.890
please have a seat.

00:19:55.911 --> 00:19:57.109
Your dishes will be right out.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.610
Thanks.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.450
Drink some water.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.740
Don't choke.

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.780
What's wrong?

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:40.930
You're awake.

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:42.690
Stomach cramps.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.000
You either drink or eat

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.060
like crazy.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.780
Is hurting yourself

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.590
the only way

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:50.540
to vent your anger?

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:53.060
I thought you weren't talking to me.

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:06.410
When I was home,

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:09.820
every time my mom cooked,

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.340
she only thought about
her precious son's taste.

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:17.000
What I liked

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.450
or didn't like,

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:20.580
she never cared.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:24.580
After I started making money,

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.740
whenever I came across
something I liked,

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:29.450
I had to eat as much as I wanted.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.300
She came to visit me a few days ago

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.780
because tomorrow is
my dad's death anniversary.

00:22:37.866 --> 00:22:39.400
But before we've gone to pay respects,

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.500
she says she has to leave.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.030
Because her precious son

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:45.580
got into a fight at school.

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:51.930
How does she move on so easily?

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:55.850
My dad hasn't been gone six months,

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:58.110
and she's already thrown out his photos,

00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:58.850
his clothes,

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.480
and even the furniture

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.690
he bought.

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:11.370
She said she needed
to let go, start fresh,

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.780
and wanted me to do the same.

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.100
Did she ever ask how I felt?

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:19.640
She erased everything

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.130
connected to my dad.

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:24.650
Their days together

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:29.610
and the child they had together...

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.690
My dad passed away
more than ten years ago.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.410
Every year on his anniversary,

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.270
she always finds an excuse not to go.

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:44.740
Why is it so hard for her

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.650
to visit his grave?

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:49.690
Maybe...

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:52.260
it's not that she forgot.

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:54.780
She's afraid to face it

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.590
or to accept

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:58.580
the fact that your dad's really gone.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.260
To face or accept things like this,

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.500
I believe

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.410
it's very difficult

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.500
for anyone.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.370
If she really didn't care,

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.020
why would she come all this way?

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.610
I'm tired. I want to sleep.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:28.820
Okay.

00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:58.820
Mom.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.880
You didn't bring the things
I bought you.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.020
You're so careless.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.690
I haven't even used the one
you bought last time.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.060
Take it back.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.890
That was ages ago.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.370
It's expired.

00:25:18.622 --> 00:25:19.880
Every time I buy you something,

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:20.740
you don't use it.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.610
Take good care of yourself.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.020
Don't stay up so late.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.200
Stop ordering takeout all the time.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:28.960
If you have time,

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.240
learn to cook.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.100
Alright.

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:34.740
You nag a lot.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.780
Go on.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.580
Don't be late.

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:38.930
Alright.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.340
I'm leaving.

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:56.370
Go home.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:15.540
Shen Yiyang,

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.260
can you go somewhere with me?

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:32.860
(Husband Chun Bainian)

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.130
My mom came.

00:28:50.644 --> 00:28:51.933
How are things coming along?

00:28:52.022 --> 00:28:53.222
Mr. Guo and his team are coming

00:28:53.222 --> 00:28:54.311
for an inspection tomorrow.

00:28:54.333 --> 00:28:55.600
Whether we get the investment

00:28:55.644 --> 00:28:56.439
depends on this.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.100
We must make sure
the demo goes perfectly.

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:00.780
Panicking won't help.

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:02.100
Don't worry, Li Wu.

00:29:02.244 --> 00:29:03.100
I have faith in you.

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:04.130
Take it step by step.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.480
Aren't you usually the one
rushing us the most?

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.690
Why are you

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:09.930
so calm today?

00:29:11.111 --> 00:29:12.930
Because I don't want
you all to stress out.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.450
Back to your work.

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:20.790
Okay.

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:22.240
I'll get out of the way, then.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.300
I can't help much anyway.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:25.210
Li Wu, great work.

00:29:40.777 --> 00:29:42.466
I look forward to
a smooth collaboration.

00:29:42.866 --> 00:29:43.690
Thank you, Mr. Guo.

00:29:43.733 --> 00:29:45.720
- Looking forward to working together.
- Me too.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.980
- Looking forward to working together.
- Right.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.240
We'll head out first.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.480
No need to walk us out.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.060
Sure.

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:52.300
Take care.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.070
The weight on my chest

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:06.690
is finally gone.

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:18.340
How was it?

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.890
We did it!

00:30:26.888 --> 00:30:28.590
Let's all have dinner together tonight.

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:29.350
Pick anywhere.

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:31.500
- Yes!
- Thank you, Cheng.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:32.930
Of course.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.060
And more importantly...

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:41.200
We're giving out bonuses.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.644
- Yay!
- Yes!

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.650
- Bonuses!
- Bonuses!

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.640
Let's go sing karaoke!

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.130
- Okay.
- Yes.

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:52.410
You've all worked hard.

00:30:52.466 --> 00:30:53.755
Let's celebrate however you want.

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:56.520
Cheng, I want to eat,
and I want to take some home, okay?

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:57.750
Sure.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.130
Thank you so much, Cheng.

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.130
(3 PM.)

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:01.890
(Your girlfriend needs your help.)

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:22.370
Look here, groom.

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:23.030
Do it like this.

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:24.240
One, two, three.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.210
One more shot.

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:26.240
Thank you.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:26.822
Look here.

00:31:26.844 --> 00:31:27.780
One, two, three.

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:31.170
Thank you for coming.

00:31:34.911 --> 00:31:35.731
Cen Jin.

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:38.590
Feng Jiao.

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:40.500
It's really you.

00:31:40.533 --> 00:31:41.480
I saw you from far away

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.020
and thought it looked like you.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.790
We graduated so long ago

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:46.133
and never ran into each other.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:47.510
It's been so long ago.

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:48.300
Right?

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.680
I thought if Wu Fu came,

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:50.690
you wouldn't come.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:52.740
That doesn't matter.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:53.540
Nice.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:55.890
Are you still single?

00:31:56.088 --> 00:31:58.155
If you meet someone suitable,
don't hesitate.

00:32:00.066 --> 00:32:01.310
Don't act like it's nothing.

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:03.270
The longer you wait, the harder it gets.

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:04.580
I'm serious. Don't wait.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.310
It's not that absolute.

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:11.610
Yeah, but if you just sit there waiting,
nothing will happen.

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:14.210
You see, everyone's so busy these days.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.270
You need to take the initiative.

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:17.850
Don't put all your focus on work.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.960
You should go out, socialize,

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.340
and meet people.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:22.890
Look at me.

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:24.000
See?

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.733
The group chats for going out
and having fun,

00:32:25.755 --> 00:32:26.911
I have a dozen pinned chats.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.422
You should come with me next time.

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:29.370
We'll see.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.750
What's Wu Fu thinking?

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:38.079
Why is he dressed like that?

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.066
People might think
they're the ones getting married.

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:40.740
Feng Jiao.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.210
Feng Jiao.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:43.890
I'll go first.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:44.790
Hello.

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:45.590
Long time no see.

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:46.450
I'll go over there.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:47.170
Sure.

00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.850
You came.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:03.980
You look great.

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:05.060
Thank you.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.580
I always look great.

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:11.300
It's nothing.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.690
I came because I want to tell you

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:15.750
I've found

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:16.820
my happiness.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.100
And I hope

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.300
you can find your own soon.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:22.580
Why?

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.577
Do you need me to
congratulate you again?

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.000
Honestly,

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.480
if you don't have anyone yet,

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.911
I can introduce someone to you.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.170
Seems like you've been
pretty free lately.

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:51.750
Sorry,

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:52.450
I'm late.

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:54.780
You're here?

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:56.580
I finished early.

00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:59.260
Sorry.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.880
I tripped in my heels

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.020
and spilled over here.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:03.610
It's fine.

00:34:03.888 --> 00:34:04.820
It didn't spill on us.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:05.690
Good.

00:34:07.555 --> 00:34:09.177
But if you two are standing
this far apart

00:34:09.177 --> 00:34:10.133
and still spilled on her,

00:34:10.133 --> 00:34:11.555
then you should really be sorry.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.290
They look so sweet.

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:22.330
Li Wu?

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.290
Why are you here?

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.222
Let me introduce myself properly.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:30.580
I'm Cen Jin's boyfriend.

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:34.330
Her boyfriend?

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:35.670
Cen Jin.

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:36.480
Look at you.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.320
Nice.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.580
Really nice.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.500
Congrats.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.210
Over here.

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:44.190
See you later.

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:44.880
We're heading off.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:45.510
Bye-bye.

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:47.400
Cen Jin, what's going on?

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.822
You brought your boyfriend here,
and you didn't introduce him to me.

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:51.920
Sorry.

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.190
Something came up.

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:54.400
It affected your wedding.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.190
Not at all.

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:56.280
You bring him here,

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.644
which means you take me seriously.

00:34:57.666 --> 00:34:58.980
I'm really happy.

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:00.380
Welcome.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:01.920
It's my honor

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.460
to come to your wedding with Cen Jin.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:05.420
Wishing you a happy,

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:06.440
everlasting marriage.

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.219
Thank you.

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:07.822
Thanks.

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:10.060
We're going to get ready.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.650
Take care of him.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.320
Okay.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.230
I hope you'll have fun here.

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.730
Sure.

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.170
You go, girl.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:19.380
- Bye.
- Okay.

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:20.150
Let's go.

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:21.630
- See you later.
- See you later. Bye-bye.

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:22.460
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.380
How did you find this place?

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:29.000
You never told me,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.500
so I could only ask Chun Chang.

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:33.290
How was I?

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.290
Did I do okay just now?

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:38.460
Not bad.

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:43.100
Dear guests.

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:44.630
Dear guests.

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:46.000
Our ceremony is about to start.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.100
Please proceed to the venue.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.210
Chun Chang.

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:01.420
Hi, Chun Chang.

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:02.810
You're here.

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:07.320
Go upstairs first.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:07.760
Okay.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:08.170
Here.

00:36:08.288 --> 00:36:09.266
Bring this up for me.

00:36:09.355 --> 00:36:09.755
Okay.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.280
Got it.

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:10.860
Sure.

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.730
Let's go.

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:21.060
What's with you?

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:23.770
Why do you look so down?

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.250
Love sick?

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:28.250
Yeah.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:30.444
I'm sick. Do you have the cure?

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:35.810
I can't help you with that.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.900
You need someone special.

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:42.580
But...

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.020
The one who can cure you

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:46.380
is back.

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:49.460
Look.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.980
- (When will you arrive?)
- (Around the afternoon.)

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.244
He'll be here this afternoon.

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:54.540
So,

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:56.550
how about you buy me a drink,

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:59.020
and I'll tell you which train he's on?

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.980
Did I say I want to know?

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:02.250
Come on.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.650
Keep pretending as you like.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:04.610
Fine.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.320
Come ask me

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.170
when you want to know.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:08.770
I'm heading up.

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:09.900
Enjoy.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:15.940
What's going on?

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:17.540
Did you fight with Mr. Shen?

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.880
No wonder he hasn't shown up

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:22.650
for days.

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:25.100
Did you make him mad?

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:26.900
I don't know.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.500
He's been hot and cold.

00:37:31.244 --> 00:37:32.810
A few days ago, he barely spoke to me.

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:34.920
When I got sick,
he came to take care of me.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.000
Just when I thought

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:36.960
we had made up,

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.210
he vanished again.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:40.840
You saw it yourself.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.690
Even Xiao Jun knows his schedule,

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:43.650
but me?

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.940
I know nothing!

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.690
No way.

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:49.540
Mr. Shen cares about you.

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:51.290
Think again.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:52.860
You definitely made him mad.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:54.690
I didn't.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:37:59.730
Oh no.

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.020
Isn't the best part of love

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.360
the push-and-pull stage

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.250
before anything happens?

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:09.760
Once you're really together,

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.940
it stops being fun.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.730
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.940
I thought it wasn't him.

00:38:20.066 --> 00:38:22.200
Sort out the experimental date
from this round quickly.

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.720
Okay.

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:25.940
Let me check where our car is.

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:27.500
I'll check.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.210
Let's ask.

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:30.760
Yiyang, has your ride arrived?

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.250
Yeah.

00:38:31.444 --> 00:38:32.420
It should be almost here.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:33.840
We'll get going first.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.670
- Sure. Bye, Yiyang.
- See you, Yiyang.

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:36.860
- See you.
- See you. Bye-bye.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.290
Shen Yiyang.

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:05.940
(Entrance, Parking)

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:18.380
You're not busy at the bar today?

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:19.500
What?

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:20.690
You don't want to see me?

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:23.500
No.

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.250
You'd better not mean that.

00:39:26.577 --> 00:39:27.955
Other people go on business trips,

00:39:27.977 --> 00:39:29.440
and they still call or video chat.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.420
You go on a trip

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.060
and don't even send a message.

00:39:32.222 --> 00:39:33.733
There's no signal in the mountains.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.100
What happened?

00:39:42.066 --> 00:39:43.960
Mosquito bites.
And I was scratched by branches.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:44.540
It's nothing.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:49.730
Look at this.

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:50.980
What's this?

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:56.130
I'm not spying on you.

00:39:56.488 --> 00:39:58.880
You've been going into
the mountains a lot for fieldwork,

00:39:58.880 --> 00:39:59.900
so I'm worried.

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:02.030
And I asked Xiao Jun.

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:03.070
He said mountain sampling

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:04.540
is full of bumps and bruises.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.460
So I prepared everything.

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:08.580
This...

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.650
I probably won't need it.

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:12.690
Isn't this also some kind of ointment?

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.380
Who cares what thing it is?

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.100
It should work.

00:40:16.244 --> 00:40:18.177
We all carry things like this
when we go out.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:18.940
Thank you.

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:21.170
Really?

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.360
But I still prepared them.

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.250
I think you'd need it sooner or later.

00:40:25.711 --> 00:40:26.960
If I need it sooner or later,

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.420
that means
I'll get hurt sooner or later?

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:31.210
No.

00:40:31.288 --> 00:40:32.510
Hopefully, you won't need it.

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:33.130
I was kidding.

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:37.460
Shen Yiyang,

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.460
that night

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:41.860
at the bar,

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.840
did you hear

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.020
what I said?

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:50.380
I did.

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.100
I'm sorry.

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:53.400
What I meant was...

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.100
Chun Chang,

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:57.170
let's...

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:00.810
have a serious relationship.

00:41:05.266 --> 00:41:06.920
(Baicao Walkway)
Lin, look at this move.

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:07.760
I keep messing it up.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.680
- How do you do this gesture?
- How do you turn it?

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:10.880
This one. Two hands.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:11.330
Like this.

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:12.510
Yes. Wrist to wrist.

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:13.020
Yeah.

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.690
Turn.

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:14.650
Turn.

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.500
Turn.

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:16.770
Turn.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:17.730
Like that.

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:18.500
Turn again.

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.940
Right.

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.030
Yes.

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:23.630
Lin, what made you suddenly

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:24.770
want to learn square dancing?

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:27.060
It's not that sudden.

00:41:27.222 --> 00:41:28.733
I've been feeling the menopause symptoms

00:41:28.733 --> 00:41:30.020
a bit more lately.

00:41:30.022 --> 00:41:31.110
I went to see the doctor,

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:32.400
and they told me

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.290
to pick up some hobbies
like singing or dancing.

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:36.480
My company union

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.280
used to run a couple of dance classes.

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.377
I learned a bit back then.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:40.380
So I'm thinking

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:42.630
maybe I could combine

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:44.510
what I learned before
with these new moves.

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:45.666
We can use them in our dance.

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:47.000
I knew it.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:47.920
Your moves

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.190
look like you have a foundation.

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:50.150
No, no.

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.920
You're so kind.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.210
You all dance really well too.

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:53.330
Oh, right, Lin,

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:55.500
does your daughter have a boyfriend now?

00:41:56.755 --> 00:41:58.210
I wouldn't say she has a boyfriend.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.100
But she's getting to know a guy.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.730
A neurologist at the Central Hospital.

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:05.460
He has a good character, good skills,

00:42:05.844 --> 00:42:07.100
and is polite and refined.

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:09.070
But dating

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:10.550
is young people's business.

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:12.360
We shouldn't interfere too much, right?

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:13.730
A neurologist?

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.130
That's a great match.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:16.840
I was actually

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.110
thinking of

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:19.150
introducing my nephew

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:20.170
to your daughter.

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:23.000
He's a lawyer overseas.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.420
He's coming back in a few days.

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:26.480
But looks like

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.130
there's no chance now.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.190
Bad timing.

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:30.420
Yeah, bad timing.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:32.590
Ladies,

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:33.920
break time's over.

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.290
Let's get a bit more practice in.

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.810
Lin,

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.210
come dance with us.

00:42:38.422 --> 00:42:39.280
You go ahead first.

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:40.840
Let me memorize the last two moves.

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:41.590
I'll join you later.

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:42.630
Watch our moves closely.

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:43.511
Okay.

00:42:43.511 --> 00:42:43.960
Alright.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.030
Alright, ladies.

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.440
Line up.

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.000
Okay.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.030
Get in line.

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:49.060
Everyone, chest up, and stomach in.

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.810
Stand straight.

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:50.880
Alright, let's do it again.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:51.730
Ready.

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:53.800
