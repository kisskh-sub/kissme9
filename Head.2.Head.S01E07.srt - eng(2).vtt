00:00:14.312 --> 00:00:15.393
It’s been five years.

00:00:15.921 --> 00:00:16.943
Time really flies.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.585
Don’t worry about him.

00:00:18.747 --> 00:00:20.967
He might live a stupid life sometimes, but…

00:00:21.353 --> 00:00:22.279
I’ll help take care of him.

00:00:26.236 --> 00:00:26.866
Are you throwing it away?

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.400
Can I write on the other half?

00:00:29.887 --> 00:00:31.741
What? What are you gonna write?

00:00:36.551 --> 00:00:37.790
My love for you.

00:00:44.796 --> 00:00:46.105
Your medication, sir.

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:56.461
All I’ve got are sleeping pills.

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.049
I told you.

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:01.596
Should we try another hospital?

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.043
Doctors here suck.

00:01:05.301 --> 00:01:06.278
Jinn, keep your voice down.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.374
Why?

00:01:08.516 --> 00:01:11.386
If they can’t cure you, then they suck.

00:01:12.522 --> 00:01:14.168
Stop frowning.

00:01:14.168 --> 00:01:16.094
I see the future.

00:01:16.378 --> 00:01:17.904
It’s not like I have cataracts.

00:01:19.122 --> 00:01:20.130
You can still crack jokes, huh?

00:01:21.449 --> 00:01:23.098
I only came to the hospital for you.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:27.325
Now relax. Nothing’s wrong.

00:01:27.528 --> 00:01:28.920
I’m perfectly fine.

00:01:29.164 --> 00:01:29.850
Okay?

00:01:32.448 --> 00:01:32.990
Mm.

00:01:35.283 --> 00:01:35.926
How about this?

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.571
Just think of it like
you’ve got a superhero boyfriend.

00:01:42.708 --> 00:01:45.610
Someone with a superpower to protect you.

00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:47.412
That should help, right?

00:01:52.871 --> 00:01:53.840
What are you spouting now?

00:01:54.327 --> 00:01:55.181
Damn.

00:01:57.251 --> 00:01:58.567
I am so freaking cool.

00:01:59.906 --> 00:02:01.483
Sure, cool guy.

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:42.484
Three.

00:03:42.707 --> 00:03:43.279
Two.

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:44.248
- One.
- One.

00:03:54.575 --> 00:03:55.096
J!

00:03:55.096 --> 00:03:56.048
Argh.

00:03:57.935 --> 00:03:58.871
Don’t let go of me.

00:03:58.993 --> 00:04:00.216
No, you let go! J!

00:04:02.123 --> 00:04:03.530
I’ll show you something.

00:04:09.334 --> 00:04:10.206
Knock it off.

00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:23.707
Why did you bring me here to swim?

00:04:24.661 --> 00:04:29.424
Don’t you like bathing or
going to the beach when you’re stressed?

00:04:30.398 --> 00:04:31.589
This will do for today.

00:04:32.644 --> 00:04:34.648
I’ll take you to a beach next time.

00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:39.531
How do you know I like
being in the water when I’m stressed?

00:04:40.708 --> 00:04:44.087
Besides my mom, I’ve never told anyone.

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:49.040
Well?

00:04:50.014 --> 00:04:51.976
I… don’t know.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.419
I just happen to know.

00:04:56.854 --> 00:05:02.373
So that means, apart from seeing the future,
you’ve got future memories as well?

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.807
I feel like it’s a shame.

00:05:23.836 --> 00:05:24.845
A shame about what?

00:05:27.463 --> 00:05:29.005
Our relationship.

00:05:33.186 --> 00:05:34.399
How did you like me?

00:05:34.825 --> 00:05:36.133
When did we fall in love?

00:05:37.513 --> 00:05:39.246
What did we like about each other?

00:05:42.107 --> 00:05:44.442
We don’t have those memories yet.

00:05:46.451 --> 00:05:48.408
Are you bothered by that?

00:05:48.753 --> 00:05:50.148
Not that much.

00:05:52.502 --> 00:05:53.659
Just a little down about it.

00:05:54.857 --> 00:05:57.425
I don’t even know what you like or don’t like.

00:06:00.327 --> 00:06:01.837
You’ll learn it as we live together.

00:06:03.866 --> 00:06:04.484
Mm.

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:08.986
If I dream about all that,

00:06:11.218 --> 00:06:12.982
you’ll be the first to know.

00:06:13.246 --> 00:06:13.834
Okay?

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.433
But that’s not the same as
remembering it myself.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:21.840
We hated each other’s guts,

00:06:22.388 --> 00:06:23.532
and all of a sudden, we became boyfriends.

00:06:24.007 --> 00:06:24.735
Who wouldn’t be confused?

00:06:36.952 --> 00:06:38.859
If it weren’t for your dreams,

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:40.945
I can’t imagine how…

00:06:42.183 --> 00:06:46.265
we’d end up together.

00:06:49.126 --> 00:06:50.769
We’d end up together one way or another.

00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:58.844
I might’ve already died
when I got hit by that bike.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.120
Jinn!

00:07:03.987 --> 00:07:06.645
If someone’s destined to die…

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:09.631
they die.

00:07:16.856 --> 00:07:19.961
Didn’t I tell you not to talk about death?

00:07:24.964 --> 00:07:25.654
Right.

00:07:26.628 --> 00:07:27.570
I’m sorry.

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:31.289
I was just being foul-mouthed.

00:07:35.592 --> 00:07:36.844
Don’t overthink it.

00:07:43.805 --> 00:07:44.418
J!

00:07:45.737 --> 00:07:46.500
Blood.

00:08:04.577 --> 00:08:05.735
I’m okay now.

00:08:06.547 --> 00:08:07.907
Stop making that worried face.

00:08:08.841 --> 00:08:10.094
Sure you don’t want to go to the hospital?

00:08:15.025 --> 00:08:18.953
If we go, it’ll be for your brain check.

00:08:19.643 --> 00:08:21.043
We were literally just there this morning.

00:08:21.144 --> 00:08:22.123
Remember?

00:08:22.448 --> 00:08:23.845
Well, you suddenly started bleeding.

00:08:24.007 --> 00:08:25.214
Am I wrong for panicking?

00:08:26.594 --> 00:08:27.907
It’s just a nosebleed.

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:29.711
Kindergarten kids get them all the time.

00:08:31.659 --> 00:08:32.998
Are you sure you’re okay?

00:08:32.998 --> 00:08:35.537
Any headache? Any symptoms?

00:08:36.998 --> 00:08:39.450
Actually… I do feel something.

00:08:41.256 --> 00:08:42.631
What is it, J? Tell me now.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.246
Are you alright, J?

00:08:44.408 --> 00:08:45.095
J!

00:08:48.504 --> 00:08:49.640
I feel like I’m your boyfriend.

00:08:51.203 --> 00:08:52.723
J, what are you playing?

00:09:00.007 --> 00:09:02.116
How are you this cute?

00:09:08.549 --> 00:09:09.181
Idiot.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.511
Stop saying stuff like that. I’m going to puke.

00:09:14.282 --> 00:09:15.821
Just admit you’re blushing.

00:09:18.906 --> 00:09:20.166
Your ears are bright red.

00:09:30.988 --> 00:09:33.502
You said it felt like a shame
about our relationship.

00:09:34.923 --> 00:09:36.071
So, from now on,

00:09:37.837 --> 00:09:40.201
I’ll focus on the present as much as I can.

00:09:41.723 --> 00:09:42.740
Can you even do that?

00:09:43.633 --> 00:09:45.962
Can you tell your feelings apart?

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:49.496
You still mix up the present and the future.

00:09:53.534 --> 00:09:55.988
Even though I already know I love you,

00:09:57.267 --> 00:10:01.610
we’re going to start
getting to know each other all over again.

00:10:03.355 --> 00:10:04.346
What do you mean?

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:10.506
Even though I know you’ve been
in love with me since you could walk—

00:10:11.764 --> 00:10:12.461
Not true.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.420
—I’m still going to hit on you.

00:10:16.292 --> 00:10:19.225
Make you fall for me even more.

00:10:23.407 --> 00:10:27.443
I’m going to make you
head over heels for me.

00:10:28.234 --> 00:10:29.135
Sounds good?

00:10:49.341 --> 00:10:52.025
Thanks for coming with me
to visit my parents.

00:10:53.304 --> 00:10:54.009
Mm.

00:11:03.118 --> 00:11:04.397
Why are you being so cold?

00:11:07.583 --> 00:11:11.110
Then how am I supposed to act
so I don’t seem cold?

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:14.619
You’re not supposed to act anything.

00:11:15.492 --> 00:11:16.993
Just being you is enough.

00:11:20.402 --> 00:11:21.653
What’s up with you?

00:11:23.703 --> 00:11:28.690
Ever since my parents passed, you’re the
only one who’s cared about me this much.

00:11:30.537 --> 00:11:31.418
What’s going on here?

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.265
Would you be my boyfriend?

00:11:42.627 --> 00:11:44.128
I don’t want to lose you to anyone.

00:11:45.264 --> 00:11:46.843
I want to have you like this—

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:19.090
Have you always known I like you?

00:12:20.808 --> 00:12:22.359
Do I even have any good traits?

00:12:22.887 --> 00:12:25.052
I don’t get what you like about me.

00:12:26.006 --> 00:12:27.248
Because you’re bad.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.664
I have to keep you in check.

00:12:30.007 --> 00:12:31.158
Hey, jerk!

00:12:31.402 --> 00:12:33.060
That was a smooth insult.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.621
But you’re being serious, right?

00:12:42.468 --> 00:12:43.380
Yes or no?

00:12:44.983 --> 00:12:45.617
Mm.

00:12:59.545 --> 00:13:01.758
What the heck are you doing, J?

00:13:02.549 --> 00:13:03.242
Courting you.

00:13:34.029 --> 00:13:36.145
What the heck are you doing, J?

00:13:38.201 --> 00:13:38.910
Courting you.

00:13:41.088 --> 00:13:43.151
No.

00:13:47.096 --> 00:13:48.574
Gosh!

00:13:48.981 --> 00:13:50.726
Ta-da!

00:13:57.653 --> 00:13:58.690
I’m begging you,

00:13:58.931 --> 00:14:00.160
please go back to how you were.

00:14:03.994 --> 00:14:05.478
Get me out of here.

00:14:35.153 --> 00:14:35.894
J.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.038
So you’re not moving out of Jinn’s place?

00:14:41.834 --> 00:14:42.533
Why?

00:14:43.274 --> 00:14:43.994
Nothing.

00:14:44.235 --> 00:14:45.354
I’m just asking.

00:14:45.613 --> 00:14:49.195
You threw such a tantrum
when you had to move in.

00:14:49.343 --> 00:14:51.403
And now you refuse to move out.

00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:54.972
Not. Your. Business.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.155
Fine!

00:14:58.025 --> 00:14:59.021
I will remember this.

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:01.914
You two never tell me anything,

00:15:02.118 --> 00:15:03.841
so I won’t tell you anything either.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.968
Is there anything in your life
even worth me being nosy about?

00:15:21.218 --> 00:15:22.610
I ordered stir-fried malindjo leaves with eggs.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.657
Hey, just got out of class.

00:15:24.953 --> 00:15:26.064
Did I keep you guys waiting?

00:15:26.212 --> 00:15:27.661
Great. We just finished eating.

00:15:30.142 --> 00:15:31.277
Finished, my ass.

00:15:31.388 --> 00:15:32.991
Your plates are still full.

00:15:36.287 --> 00:15:37.265
Seriously.

00:15:37.858 --> 00:15:39.379
Don’t you have friends from your faculty?

00:15:40.286 --> 00:15:41.923
I do have some.

00:15:41.923 --> 00:15:42.472
And?

00:15:42.824 --> 00:15:45.017
I love you guys more.

00:15:47.777 --> 00:15:51.088
Wow. You look so disgusted.

00:15:51.088 --> 00:15:52.532
I’m sad, you know?

00:15:52.625 --> 00:15:58.196
Do you have any idea what
I just went through before I came to see you?

00:15:58.196 --> 00:15:58.911
What?

00:15:59.337 --> 00:16:04.566
My professor just roasted
my assignment like it was trash.

00:16:04.696 --> 00:16:06.231
Maybe that’s because you suck.

00:16:06.453 --> 00:16:08.182
Damn, listen to that.

00:16:08.182 --> 00:16:10.832
Not only did he not comfort me,
he insulted me even more.

00:16:10.832 --> 00:16:11.623
Guys.

00:16:12.271 --> 00:16:14.868
Why don’t you
take me out for drinks tonight?

00:16:15.053 --> 00:16:16.271
I need to de-stress.

00:16:16.827 --> 00:16:21.068
So all that buildup
just because you want to drink?

00:16:21.068 --> 00:16:21.916
Don’t you?

00:16:21.916 --> 00:16:23.241
My mouth’s watering already.

00:16:23.241 --> 00:16:24.911
Exactly.

00:16:28.522 --> 00:16:29.516
So, what do you say?

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:42.066
Don’t spit it out.

00:16:42.214 --> 00:16:43.009
Don’t!

00:16:43.009 --> 00:16:44.192
Cheers, come on!

00:16:44.192 --> 00:16:45.205
Cheers!

00:16:45.205 --> 00:16:46.848
Yay!

00:16:48.607 --> 00:16:50.053
Man, this is fun.

00:16:50.812 --> 00:16:53.118
You two really love to drink, huh?

00:16:53.229 --> 00:16:54.542
You seem thirsty all the time.

00:16:55.968 --> 00:16:57.871
Don’t just sit there. Get up and dance!

00:16:57.871 --> 00:16:59.008
No. I don’t dance.

00:16:59.008 --> 00:17:01.580
- I’ve seen you dance before.
- Get up.

00:17:04.784 --> 00:17:06.131
Don’t you want to dance with them?

00:17:06.501 --> 00:17:08.184
No. They look stupid.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:09.899
They look insane.

00:17:10.603 --> 00:17:11.744
They look mad.

00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:13.171
Look at them.

00:17:13.875 --> 00:17:14.972
Who would do that?

00:17:16.176 --> 00:17:17.470
Cheers.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:18.355
Hey, where’s the energy?

00:17:18.596 --> 00:17:22.665
Cheers!

00:17:22.665 --> 00:17:24.490
Cheers!

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:32.667
Give me more.

00:17:34.564 --> 00:17:37.276
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:45.141 --> 00:17:45.674
Hey.

00:17:46.952 --> 00:17:47.978
Want to step out for a cigarette?

00:17:48.494 --> 00:17:49.066
Come on.

00:17:57.808 --> 00:17:58.362
You want one?

00:17:59.455 --> 00:18:00.261
I quit.

00:18:00.539 --> 00:18:01.775
Just like that?

00:18:04.072 --> 00:18:05.342
Probably because I’ll quit in the future.

00:18:06.231 --> 00:18:07.658
So right now, I don’t want it.

00:18:08.695 --> 00:18:09.874
Again with this?

00:18:11.088 --> 00:18:13.197
What did Jinn say when you told him?

00:18:13.586 --> 00:18:14.506
He was shocked.

00:18:15.691 --> 00:18:17.957
But he’s the one who
should believe this thing the most.

00:18:18.939 --> 00:18:22.037
Because the vision I see
is about him and me.

00:18:23.556 --> 00:18:24.436
What did you just say?

00:18:27.196 --> 00:18:29.896
So the one in your dreams is Jinn?

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:34.262
Right now, Jinn and I are boyfriends.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:34.910
What?!

00:18:35.688 --> 00:18:36.413
Are you serious?

00:18:37.839 --> 00:18:42.705
It’s what I see ten years from now.

00:18:43.094 --> 00:18:45.314
And Jinn believed you that easily?

00:18:46.088 --> 00:18:48.089
Because what I see is real.

00:18:48.385 --> 00:18:50.340
I even saved him from an accident.

00:18:51.748 --> 00:18:53.656
So you’re telling me
you can change the future?

00:18:55.026 --> 00:18:56.335
Jinn said the same thing.

00:18:57.557 --> 00:19:00.038
But that sounds way too dramatic for me.

00:19:00.668 --> 00:19:02.093
I’m not changing anything.

00:19:02.408 --> 00:19:02.908
I…

00:19:05.112 --> 00:19:06.174
I just helped him.

00:19:06.174 --> 00:19:07.938
What the hell am I hearing here?

00:19:15.573 --> 00:19:17.263
Hey, I’ll be right back.

00:19:18.819 --> 00:19:19.615
Where are you going?

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:38.422
Hey, Farm!

00:19:39.311 --> 00:19:40.034
Hey!

00:19:41.201 --> 00:19:41.856
Hey.

00:19:42.782 --> 00:19:43.677
Wait up.

00:19:45.233 --> 00:19:45.870
Wait.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.191
I’m sorry.

00:19:49.673 --> 00:19:50.485
That’s it?

00:19:52.133 --> 00:19:54.136
I got carried away. I’m really sorry.

00:19:54.229 --> 00:19:56.504
Carried away enough
to forget you have a boyfriend?

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.467
You know how I am
and I was so drunk just now.

00:20:02.967 --> 00:20:04.545
I don’t even know who that girl is.

00:20:04.545 --> 00:20:07.239
So I’m supposed to just
accept the way you are, Van?

00:20:10.795 --> 00:20:12.586
It’s not like that, Farm.

00:20:14.697 --> 00:20:16.390
I’ll try to keep myself in check from now on.

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:17.424
I’m sorry.

00:20:18.109 --> 00:20:19.197
I’m truly sorry.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:28.788
Don’t ever forget you have me.

00:20:38.399 --> 00:20:39.449
Hey.

00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:41.384
You made it to the bed.

00:20:53.538 --> 00:20:55.489
I didn’t know you were such a drunk.

00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:00.294
It’s once in a blue moon.

00:21:01.461 --> 00:21:02.751
I’m going to shower.

00:21:04.436 --> 00:21:06.002
Just lie down.

00:21:06.002 --> 00:21:07.177
I’ll give you a sponge bath.

00:21:07.417 --> 00:21:10.793
If you shower like this, you’ll slip,
crack your head, and die.

00:21:11.784 --> 00:21:12.284
Fine.

00:22:07.452 --> 00:22:08.337
Are you asleep?

00:22:09.911 --> 00:22:10.536
What?

00:22:13.184 --> 00:22:13.873
I’m sorry.

00:22:14.873 --> 00:22:15.570
Mm.

00:22:18.718 --> 00:22:19.925
I’m sorry.

00:22:20.573 --> 00:22:21.993
I know!

00:22:23.975 --> 00:22:24.880
I’m sorry!

00:22:29.393 --> 00:22:30.313
Get some sleep.

00:22:39.304 --> 00:22:40.379
I am sorry.

00:22:56.696 --> 00:22:57.891
You’re a good kisser.

00:22:59.373 --> 00:23:00.915
How many girls have you kissed?

00:23:02.915 --> 00:23:04.059
You’re still upset.

00:23:04.911 --> 00:23:06.217
I’m just curious.

00:23:08.291 --> 00:23:10.979
You know, kissing isn’t
the only thing I’m good at.

00:23:36.723 --> 00:23:37.858
So this is your way of making it up to me?

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:39.604
I’m giving it a try.

00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:41.722
No idea if it’s working, though.

00:23:42.185 --> 00:23:43.118
And if it’s not?

00:23:44.729 --> 00:23:46.075
It doesn’t hurt to try.

00:24:01.468 --> 00:24:04.791
Thank you for caring so much about me.

00:24:32.867 --> 00:24:33.545
What?

00:24:35.217 --> 00:24:37.145
Don’t forget to take your meds.

00:24:41.569 --> 00:24:43.577
You shouldn’t be
worrying about someone else.

00:26:31.793 --> 00:26:32.713
Is it here?

00:26:47.215 --> 00:26:48.466
(You’re not my dad!)

00:26:49.364 --> 00:26:50.231
(Jinn.)

00:26:50.231 --> 00:26:51.062
(And I’m not your son!)

00:26:51.062 --> 00:26:52.056
(Jinn.)

00:26:52.056 --> 00:26:53.075
(Jinn, wake up.)

00:26:54.554 --> 00:26:55.192
Auntie Jan.

00:26:56.125 --> 00:26:56.885
Auntie Jan.

00:26:57.431 --> 00:26:58.603
Jinn, wake up.

00:26:58.885 --> 00:26:59.874
Auntie Jan.

00:27:12.019 --> 00:27:12.766
Hello.

00:27:13.505 --> 00:27:15.388
(Where are you? Are you out?)

00:27:16.972 --> 00:27:17.746
Uh…

00:27:18.468 --> 00:27:20.909
(I took the sleeping pills last night.)

00:27:21.279 --> 00:27:22.869
(So I woke up early.)

00:27:23.239 --> 00:27:25.441
(Now I’m running outside.)

00:27:27.272 --> 00:27:28.104
Which park?

00:27:30.357 --> 00:27:32.108
Not far from he condo.

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:33.248
I’ll be back soon.

00:27:33.618 --> 00:27:34.350
Should I pick you up?

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:35.060
Don’t drive!

00:27:39.109 --> 00:27:40.243
Why are you shouting?

00:27:44.626 --> 00:27:45.641
I’m sorry.

00:27:46.328 --> 00:27:47.708
It’s loud here.

00:27:48.694 --> 00:27:49.705
I thought you wouldn’t hear me.

00:27:51.569 --> 00:27:53.960
Are you coming back
so we can go to uni together?

00:27:54.453 --> 00:27:55.924
Yes, I am.

00:27:57.878 --> 00:27:58.482
(Okay.)

00:27:58.852 --> 00:28:00.150
(I’ll make coffee for you.)

00:28:01.048 --> 00:28:01.597
Sure.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.267
So where did you go this morning?

00:28:19.482 --> 00:28:20.345
I told you, I was out running.

00:28:21.569 --> 00:28:22.470
Why didn’t you ask me to go too?

00:28:23.104 --> 00:28:24.355
You couldn’t even sleep
without feeling like puking.

00:28:24.355 --> 00:28:26.622
How dare you expect me
to wake you up to run?

00:28:29.742 --> 00:28:30.815
Oh, shit!

00:28:31.079 --> 00:28:31.579
Shit!

00:28:40.122 --> 00:28:40.756
Jinn.

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:42.561
Don’t move him!

00:28:42.966 --> 00:28:44.617
Van, call an ambulance now.

00:28:44.617 --> 00:28:45.888
Okay, I’m on it.

00:28:47.191 --> 00:28:48.782
Please come quickly.

00:29:04.892 --> 00:29:07.315
J, the doctor said he’ll be fine.

00:29:07.315 --> 00:29:08.270
You don’t need to look so gloomy.

00:29:09.185 --> 00:29:11.141
If he’s fine, then why isn’t he waking up?

00:29:11.352 --> 00:29:12.830
Give him time.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.644
He got stitches and injections.

00:29:14.644 --> 00:29:15.605
It’s normal for him to sleep.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:19.427
Hey—he’s waking up!

00:29:19.533 --> 00:29:20.416
How are you?

00:29:20.557 --> 00:29:21.570
Do you remember me?

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:22.291
What’s my name?

00:29:22.291 --> 00:29:23.249
What’s your name?

00:29:23.249 --> 00:29:23.938
Come on!

00:29:24.642 --> 00:29:26.533
His condition’s going to
get worse because of you two.

00:29:29.244 --> 00:29:30.260
How are you feeling?

00:29:32.584 --> 00:29:33.642
You’ve got a concussion.

00:29:34.064 --> 00:29:36.891
But you’ve been scanned
and the doctor said nothing’s serious.

00:29:39.532 --> 00:29:40.473
What hit me?

00:29:40.825 --> 00:29:41.942
You don’t remember anything?

00:29:44.407 --> 00:29:47.701
I remember walking… then passing out.

00:29:48.546 --> 00:29:49.649
A metal piece fell from the roof.

00:29:50.776 --> 00:29:52.214
It grazed your head.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:54.203
Damn.

00:29:54.942 --> 00:29:56.365
Glad I didn’t get brain damage.

00:29:56.999 --> 00:29:58.688
We’re glad you’re okay.

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:01.110
It’s already late.

00:30:01.569 --> 00:30:02.865
We’ll head out now.

00:30:03.867 --> 00:30:04.679
Already?

00:30:05.207 --> 00:30:06.559
Why don’t we stay and play with Jinn first?

00:30:06.559 --> 00:30:08.096
He’s injured. Let him rest.

00:30:08.589 --> 00:30:10.028
Mai, come with me. I’ll drop you off.

00:30:10.961 --> 00:30:12.861
Good thing you have a hard skull.

00:30:13.266 --> 00:30:15.043
I should borrow it to make a talisman.

00:30:15.325 --> 00:30:15.968
Moron.

00:30:16.743 --> 00:30:18.111
Yep, he’s fine.

00:30:18.674 --> 00:30:19.174
Come on.

00:30:20.001 --> 00:30:20.909
I’ll walk you guys out.

00:30:21.569 --> 00:30:22.510
Bye-bye.

00:30:22.739 --> 00:30:23.760
Get well soon.

00:30:23.971 --> 00:30:24.471
Bye.

00:30:42.852 --> 00:30:43.635
What’s wrong?

00:30:45.554 --> 00:30:47.428
I took sleeping pills last night,

00:30:48.467 --> 00:30:49.281
so I didn’t dream.

00:30:51.024 --> 00:30:52.487
If I had, I would’ve been able to help you.

00:31:02.602 --> 00:31:03.143
Look.

00:31:04.393 --> 00:31:05.671
It was an accident.

00:31:07.889 --> 00:31:09.624
But I was able to help you last time.

00:31:10.434 --> 00:31:12.236
I hate that you’re blaming yourself.

00:31:15.352 --> 00:31:16.258
It’s my body.

00:31:17.191 --> 00:31:18.295
Whatever happens to it,

00:31:18.295 --> 00:31:20.966
whatever hurts—it's on me.

00:31:22.304 --> 00:31:23.494
It’s not your fault.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:44.041
This is what I’ve been afraid of
ever since I knew you could see the future.

00:31:47.861 --> 00:31:51.060
Thank you for caring so much about me.

00:31:52.574 --> 00:31:54.404
But if something happens to me one day…

00:31:58.030 --> 00:31:59.653
or if tomorrow I—

00:32:06.677 --> 00:32:09.739
I told you not to say things like that.

00:32:11.569 --> 00:32:12.856
It’s unavoidable.

00:32:14.528 --> 00:32:16.527
People die. That’s how life works.

00:32:16.527 --> 00:32:17.110
Jinn.

00:32:20.349 --> 00:32:21.525
Promise me.

00:32:22.564 --> 00:32:24.080
If something happens to me one day,

00:32:25.594 --> 00:32:26.699
don’t blame yourself.

00:32:27.403 --> 00:32:28.848
I can’t promise that.

00:32:30.855 --> 00:32:31.672
Then we should break up.

00:32:34.577 --> 00:32:35.825
Why are you saying this?

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:38.234
If we’re together but not happy,

00:32:38.868 --> 00:32:40.099
why keep going?

00:32:41.155 --> 00:32:43.296
You’ll always be paranoid,
always terrified I’ll die.

00:32:44.335 --> 00:32:46.626
And what if you’re wrong? If I’m safe?

00:32:47.119 --> 00:32:48.814
You might be the one
who ends up losing your mind.

00:32:48.814 --> 00:32:49.623
I’m not breaking up.

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:55.731
Then give me the promise.

00:32:56.974 --> 00:33:00.432
From here on out, we live a normal life.

00:33:02.914 --> 00:33:05.990
I won’t mind if you see something
in your dreams and want to help me

00:33:07.627 --> 00:33:08.839
because I’m scared of dying too.

00:33:11.286 --> 00:33:13.235
But if something happens to me one day,

00:33:17.372 --> 00:33:18.796
I’ll believe you did your best.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.843
Be careful.

00:33:58.265 --> 00:33:59.888
I hurt my head, not my feet.

00:33:59.888 --> 00:34:01.718
Just let me take care of you. Hm?

00:34:55.386 --> 00:34:56.608
Sleeping like a log, huh?

00:35:19.267 --> 00:35:20.142
Be careful.

00:35:20.648 --> 00:35:22.119
I hurt my head, not my feet.

00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:23.279
I can walk.

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:25.332
Can’t I worry about you?

00:35:26.596 --> 00:35:28.466
Why don’t you just carry me, then?

00:35:28.777 --> 00:35:29.876
J! I was joking.

00:35:33.648 --> 00:35:34.813
I missed my room.

00:35:40.222 --> 00:35:42.662
So you didn’t tell my mom, right?

00:35:43.226 --> 00:35:44.102
Do you want me to?

00:35:45.891 --> 00:35:46.844
Good thing you didn’t.

00:35:47.544 --> 00:35:49.106
My mom might sue the university.

00:35:49.748 --> 00:35:51.226
That would just turn it into a huge drama.

00:35:52.587 --> 00:35:56.531
Then stay here until your wound heals.

00:35:58.417 --> 00:35:59.256
I guess that’s how it has to be.

00:36:00.501 --> 00:36:01.840
If you need anything, ask me.

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:03.707
Don’t walk too much.

00:36:04.912 --> 00:36:06.762
I already told you I didn’t hurt my feet.

00:36:07.598 --> 00:36:09.781
Just let me take care of you.

00:36:10.092 --> 00:36:10.592
Hm?

00:36:11.564 --> 00:36:12.141
Fine.

00:36:13.074 --> 00:36:14.596
I’ll make you do everything.

00:36:27.637 --> 00:36:29.701
I’ll go fix the bed for you.

00:37:19.462 --> 00:37:20.653
Still working?

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:22.782
Yes, but I’m almost done.

00:37:28.971 --> 00:37:30.073
Why are you so pretty today?

00:37:33.695 --> 00:37:34.352
Let’s go, Jan.

00:37:49.313 --> 00:37:50.512
If you choose him,

00:37:50.512 --> 00:37:51.709
then you don’t need me in your life.

00:37:51.709 --> 00:37:52.369
- Jinn.
- Jinn.

00:38:08.967 --> 00:38:10.733
I can actually go to class, you know.

00:38:11.958 --> 00:38:12.837
Just rest.

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:14.409
You have a medical certificate.

00:38:14.856 --> 00:38:16.564
Staying in is boring.

00:38:17.964 --> 00:38:19.217
I’ll be back soon to keep you company.

00:38:21.764 --> 00:38:22.442
Fine.

00:38:22.889 --> 00:38:25.190
Your lunch and dinner are in the fridge.

00:38:25.423 --> 00:38:26.465
Heat them up when you’re hungry.

00:38:26.815 --> 00:38:27.484
Yes, sir.

00:38:28.262 --> 00:38:29.322
If you need anything, call me.

00:38:30.178 --> 00:38:30.710
Noted.

00:38:32.129 --> 00:38:32.712
I’m heading out now.

00:38:33.489 --> 00:38:34.364
Go already.

00:38:38.863 --> 00:38:40.030
What?

00:38:40.263 --> 00:38:41.665
I said you were lonely just now.

00:38:42.832 --> 00:38:43.477
Okay, I’m off.

00:38:44.002 --> 00:38:44.910
Bye-bye.

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:02.583
Here.

00:39:03.264 --> 00:39:03.998
Remove it.

00:39:05.048 --> 00:39:06.577
I’ll show you the ropes, kiddo.

00:39:07.899 --> 00:39:10.086
You start with this. Makes it easier.

00:39:13.197 --> 00:39:13.872
There.

00:39:19.044 --> 00:39:20.215
I like you when you’re like this.

00:39:22.159 --> 00:39:23.305
You’ve said that before.

00:39:24.394 --> 00:39:24.928
Hey!

00:39:26.308 --> 00:39:27.637
We’re in the classroom.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:28.842
So?

00:39:29.192 --> 00:39:30.048
No one saw us.

00:39:30.767 --> 00:39:31.961
Like hell they didn’t.

00:39:32.855 --> 00:39:34.099
Why? Want me to do it again?

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:35.145
Van!

00:39:36.953 --> 00:39:38.386
Alright, alright. You keep going.

00:39:38.717 --> 00:39:39.692
This part is done.

00:39:44.456 --> 00:39:46.488
So J decided to skip too?

00:39:46.488 --> 00:39:48.045
Yeah. I think he’s staying in with Jinn.

00:39:49.095 --> 00:39:49.887
What’s up with those two?

00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:51.283
They stick together like spouses.

00:39:52.216 --> 00:39:52.932
Hey!

00:39:53.613 --> 00:39:55.943
Folks from my faculty
are throwing a party tonight.

00:39:56.196 --> 00:39:56.876
Are you in?

00:39:57.479 --> 00:39:59.722
No. I’m staying in. Don’t feel like going out.

00:40:00.927 --> 00:40:02.286
Gosh, you’re boring.

00:40:11.944 --> 00:40:14.128
Welcome to The J. Room.

00:40:28.278 --> 00:40:29.011
Have some water, dear.

00:40:29.011 --> 00:40:29.675
Thank you.

00:40:29.831 --> 00:40:31.069
Is it just you?

00:40:31.536 --> 00:40:32.096
Yes.

00:40:33.788 --> 00:40:34.828
Is something wrong, son?

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.396
Wait, did Jinn cause some trouble?

00:40:40.396 --> 00:40:41.842
No, Auntie Jan.

00:40:42.911 --> 00:40:46.269
Then what’s so urgent
that you came to see me here?

00:40:47.455 --> 00:40:48.308
Well…

00:40:49.552 --> 00:40:50.534
It’s…

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:51.897
J.

00:40:52.422 --> 00:40:54.050
You can talk to me.

00:41:01.146 --> 00:41:02.056
About Uncle Jet…

00:41:03.028 --> 00:41:04.765
When are you planning to tell Jinn?

00:41:05.873 --> 00:41:07.377
How did you find out, dear?

00:41:07.377 --> 00:41:08.606
When did you learn about this?

00:41:10.939 --> 00:41:13.074
I’d like you to talk to Jinn soon.

00:41:13.405 --> 00:41:14.606
I don’t want him to find out on his own.

00:41:17.756 --> 00:41:21.158
Do you know
I think about this every single day?

00:41:22.441 --> 00:41:25.477
I want Jinn to make peace with his father.

00:41:26.838 --> 00:41:29.246
There’s so much he doesn’t know.

00:41:31.832 --> 00:41:34.181
That’s why I want you to
patch things up with him as soon as you can.

00:41:35.795 --> 00:41:39.019
You know how Jinn is, don’t you?

00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:41.322
Yes.

00:41:41.963 --> 00:41:44.306
Just hearing the name Jet
is enough to make him explode.

00:41:50.275 --> 00:41:52.388
If there’s anything I can do to help,

00:41:54.138 --> 00:41:55.479
please tell me, Auntie Jan.

00:41:56.957 --> 00:41:58.099
I really…

00:41:59.966 --> 00:42:02.548
want you to settle this with Jinn.

00:42:21.402 --> 00:42:25.616
(Eat, then take your meds
so you can recover soon. Love you.)

00:42:28.183 --> 00:42:32.214
I’ll find a time to
talk to Jinn as soon as possible.

00:42:32.447 --> 00:42:33.503
Sure, Auntie Jan.

00:42:33.503 --> 00:42:34.279
I’ll get going then.

00:42:34.882 --> 00:42:35.576
Thanks, dear.

00:42:51.995 --> 00:42:54.154
(From what I’ve seen in the movies…)

00:42:56.293 --> 00:42:58.677
when you decide to change something,

00:42:59.338 --> 00:43:03.911
it affects the future. Right?

00:43:21.508 --> 00:43:23.487
(This is your lunch. Love you.)

00:43:23.662 --> 00:43:25.778
(This is your dinner. Love you.)

00:44:08.633 --> 00:44:09.513
(Love you.)

00:44:16.571 --> 00:44:19.554
Is there anything else
about you that I still don’t know?

00:44:19.554 --> 00:44:20.987
You’re my boyfriend now.

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:24.737
If being with me doesn’t make your life better,
then why be with me at all?

00:44:25.029 --> 00:44:26.508
I’ll tell you if anything happens next time.

00:44:26.897 --> 00:44:27.535
Okay?

00:44:32.726 --> 00:44:33.501
J!

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:35.428
Jinn, don’t go.

00:44:37.333 --> 00:44:43.048
Does that mean in two years
Auntie Jan will die and you’ll disappear?

00:44:43.301 --> 00:44:44.880
I just want to hug you tight.

00:44:45.736 --> 00:44:48.296
Your hug feels like
I’m being wrapped by a snake.

00:44:48.782 --> 00:44:49.838
Well, I love you.

00:44:50.382 --> 00:44:53.681
When will you tell people about us?

00:44:53.917 --> 00:44:55.327
Even if we haven’t,
it already feels like we have.

00:44:55.541 --> 00:44:56.769
I mean with our parents.

00:44:57.741 --> 00:44:58.516
I just realized something.

00:44:59.177 --> 00:45:00.216
Realized what?

00:45:00.469 --> 00:45:01.666
A way to make you feel better.

00:45:01.802 --> 00:45:02.379
Huh?
