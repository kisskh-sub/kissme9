00:00:51.198 --> 00:00:52.767
You asked me if I liked you.

00:00:52.767 --> 00:00:52.867
You asked me if I liked you.

00:00:54.076 --> 00:00:54.952
Yes.

00:00:56.036 --> 00:00:56.871
I like you.

00:00:57.997 --> 00:01:00.833
So forget Melomaster.

00:01:03.586 --> 00:01:05.254
Start seeing me from now on.

00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:13.888
You seem to like Melomaster more than me,

00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:17.641
but I like Wi Jeong-sin
just as much as I like Soulishere.

00:01:18.309 --> 00:01:19.184
Hold on.

00:01:19.727 --> 00:01:21.770
What are you talking about?

00:01:23.188 --> 00:01:24.356
How do you even know Melomaster?

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.566
Because it was me.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.277
No, but I've met him before.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.278
That's right.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.574
The man you met at the N Seoul Tower
that day was someone else.

00:01:33.657 --> 00:01:36.410
I had someone else go in my place.

00:01:38.495 --> 00:01:40.205
But the first rice cooker transaction?

00:01:40.873 --> 00:01:42.082
That was me.

00:01:51.383 --> 00:01:53.093
Do you like Lim Hyeon-jun?

00:01:58.432 --> 00:01:59.975
My brother had listed the rice cooker,

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:01.769
but plans changed, so I came out instead.

00:02:02.895 --> 00:02:04.855
I didn't recognize you back then either.

00:02:05.397 --> 00:02:06.440
But when you said

00:02:06.523 --> 00:02:08.108
you were a fan of mine,

00:02:09.193 --> 00:02:10.152
I became interested.

00:02:11.445 --> 00:02:12.780
I'm a fan of Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:02:14.907 --> 00:02:16.367
Oh, thank you.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.826
I have a whole box at home.

00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:28.128
I know it'll take some time
to wrap your head around all this.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.506
I can wait.

00:02:33.384 --> 00:02:35.302
-Let's go.
-Go where?

00:02:35.386 --> 00:02:36.679
Home, of course.

00:02:38.013 --> 00:02:38.931
Right.

00:02:40.015 --> 00:02:41.517
This is the umbrella I gave you.

00:02:42.393 --> 00:02:43.477
The Kang Pil-gu umbrella.

00:02:47.147 --> 00:02:48.107
Let's get going.

00:02:52.236 --> 00:02:53.237
You must be really surprised.

00:02:56.865 --> 00:02:58.200
I mean, I tried to…

00:02:58.951 --> 00:03:00.035
Jeez.

00:03:01.328 --> 00:03:04.164
You probably can't process
a word I'm saying…

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:06.583
but I'm sorry.

00:03:08.293 --> 00:03:09.586
I was really surprised too.

00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:14.508
I was so shocked
that I couldn't say anything.

00:03:43.996 --> 00:03:47.374
Well, take the rice cooker back.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.377
You said it worked fine.

00:03:50.461 --> 00:03:53.756
It may be big and expensive,
but it's a good fit for your home.

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.800
And we're a good fit too.

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:02.848
Where did that even come from?

00:04:06.435 --> 00:04:07.936
When I said it wasn't a good fit,

00:04:08.896 --> 00:04:10.272
I just meant that it's too big.

00:04:11.315 --> 00:04:13.525
For a family of two, the rice cooker

00:04:14.485 --> 00:04:15.986
isn't a good fit for our home…

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.865
So I'm saying,
don't sell off the rice cooker

00:04:20.365 --> 00:04:21.408
and use it until it breaks down.

00:04:21.492 --> 00:04:23.827
No, even if it breaks down,
fix it and use it.

00:04:23.911 --> 00:04:25.913
No, I mean…

00:04:25.996 --> 00:04:27.706
I'll deal with the rice cooker!

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:28.665
Okay.

00:04:32.377 --> 00:04:34.838
Well, go inside and get some rest.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.007
-Get home safely.
-All right.

00:04:38.092 --> 00:04:40.260
-I'll be in touch then.
-You can borrow the umbrella.

00:04:40.344 --> 00:04:41.345
Okay, thank you.

00:04:43.931 --> 00:04:45.140
I'll be in touch.

00:04:46.141 --> 00:04:47.893
-Here…
-I can take care of it myself.

00:05:09.373 --> 00:05:10.749
EPISODE 12

00:05:18.507 --> 00:05:19.424
You're back.

00:05:21.885 --> 00:05:24.179
Wait, why'd you bring
the rice cooker back?

00:05:24.263 --> 00:05:25.931
-Was it a no-show?
-No.

00:05:26.014 --> 00:05:27.599
Did they not want it?

00:05:27.683 --> 00:05:28.767
Can we use it then?

00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:31.645
Can we?

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:33.480
Why aren't you…

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:36.942
What's the matter with her?

00:05:37.025 --> 00:05:39.736
Her mood swings
have been really bad these days.

00:05:58.005 --> 00:05:59.965
You asked me if I liked you.

00:06:01.216 --> 00:06:02.050
Yes.

00:06:04.303 --> 00:06:05.304
I like you.

00:06:05.971 --> 00:06:07.598
Start seeing me from now on.

00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:27.284
"What's your name?"

00:06:29.995 --> 00:06:31.413
This is a fun script.

00:06:51.558 --> 00:06:53.685
SOULISHERE

00:07:02.945 --> 00:07:04.529
And we're a good fit too.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.792
SOULISHERE

00:07:29.554 --> 00:07:30.472
I'll be in touch.

00:07:43.485 --> 00:07:48.865
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 5

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:50.325
SOULISHERE

00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:03.046
Jeez.

00:08:26.069 --> 00:08:27.070
I like you.

00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:28.613
Onion!

00:08:29.906 --> 00:08:30.866
I'll be in touch.

00:08:35.537 --> 00:08:37.039
I wanted to tell you again

00:08:37.122 --> 00:08:39.291
that I'm sorry
for unintentionally lying to you.

00:08:40.125 --> 00:08:43.128
I couldn't meet you that day
because people would've recognized me.

00:08:43.211 --> 00:08:44.087
I'm sorry.

00:08:50.927 --> 00:08:51.928
Onion!

00:08:56.892 --> 00:08:57.726
And from now on,

00:08:57.809 --> 00:09:01.063
I'll message you
instead of using the Onion app.

00:09:09.154 --> 00:09:10.364
Sweet dreams.

00:09:14.576 --> 00:09:16.703
It was me, Melomaster.

00:09:17.996 --> 00:09:19.915
I was Melomaster,

00:09:19.998 --> 00:09:21.249
and Melomaster

00:09:22.292 --> 00:09:23.293
was me.

00:09:37.224 --> 00:09:38.350
MELOMASTER (DELETED USER)

00:09:42.771 --> 00:09:45.023
I'M SO LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
MY HEART'S POUNDING.

00:09:52.197 --> 00:09:54.991
HE'S MANLY,
YET STILL HAS THAT BOYISH CHARM

00:10:07.212 --> 00:10:08.547
I'm a fan of Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.590
Do you like Lim Hyeon-jun?

00:10:10.674 --> 00:10:11.758
Yes, I do.

00:10:12.759 --> 00:10:14.928
Kang Pil-gu Season 5 is coming out soon.

00:10:15.011 --> 00:10:16.888
I'm so looking forward to it.
My heart's pounding.

00:10:16.972 --> 00:10:18.890
Have you seen Kang Pil-gu in person?

00:10:18.974 --> 00:10:19.975
I have.

00:10:20.475 --> 00:10:22.102
-What did you think of him?
-He was really cool, of course.

00:10:23.103 --> 00:10:25.605
He's manly,
yet still has that boyish charm.

00:10:26.398 --> 00:10:29.151
You can be old and still be cool.

00:10:29.234 --> 00:10:31.695
Everyone has their own kind of charm
that suits their age.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.115
You really do sound
exactly like Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:10:35.782 --> 00:10:38.285
Can you say a line from Kang Pil-gu?

00:10:38.368 --> 00:10:40.287
"They say you can't fix people."

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.122
"But I do."

00:10:44.374 --> 00:10:46.126
Wow, how are you so good at impressions?

00:10:46.209 --> 00:10:48.170
I just discovered
Lim Hyeon-jun's fan page.

00:10:48.253 --> 00:10:50.130
You should join it too, Melomaster.

00:10:50.213 --> 00:10:51.214
We can take part together.

00:10:51.298 --> 00:10:52.549
No way!

00:10:52.632 --> 00:10:55.677
Lim Hyeon-jun replied to
one of my posts on the fan page.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.846
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited!

00:10:58.555 --> 00:11:00.348
Melomaster, you should post something too.

00:11:00.432 --> 00:11:02.767
Who knows?
Lim Hyeon-jun might leave a reply.

00:11:05.729 --> 00:11:07.022
It's the first time in my life.

00:11:08.732 --> 00:11:09.900
I've never liked someone…

00:11:11.026 --> 00:11:12.819
so unconditionally.

00:12:40.115 --> 00:12:41.283
What?

00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:50.792
Hello?

00:12:52.043 --> 00:12:52.919
What?

00:12:54.296 --> 00:12:55.463
Right now?

00:12:56.047 --> 00:12:56.881
But…

00:12:59.301 --> 00:13:01.344
Yes, of course.

00:13:01.928 --> 00:13:04.431
Okay, I got it.

00:13:04.514 --> 00:13:05.932
Just give me a second.

00:13:06.641 --> 00:13:07.601
Hold on.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:09.728
There you are.

00:13:12.314 --> 00:13:13.148
You don't look so well.

00:13:15.984 --> 00:13:16.860
Did you not get any sleep?

00:13:18.278 --> 00:13:19.821
Are you really Melomaster?

00:13:24.117 --> 00:13:26.328
-Yes, I am.
-Really?

00:13:28.663 --> 00:13:30.123
How can this all be a coincidence?

00:13:30.874 --> 00:13:32.876
How could something like this happen?

00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:34.544
I'm not sure either.

00:13:35.253 --> 00:13:36.838
-Were you playing me?
-I don't…

00:13:36.921 --> 00:13:38.840
Was it fun watching me
make a fool out of myself?

00:13:39.507 --> 00:13:41.259
Why would you think I played you?

00:13:41.343 --> 00:13:43.970
Everything I said to you
as Melomaster was genuinely…

00:13:44.054 --> 00:13:44.929
Are you okay?

00:13:46.097 --> 00:13:48.642
-I'll call 119…
-No, my legs just gave out.

00:13:48.725 --> 00:13:51.227
-You should go to the hospital.
-I said I'm fine!

00:13:53.938 --> 00:13:56.441
Then at least let me take you inside.

00:14:02.572 --> 00:14:03.406
Careful.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:05.033
Watch the steps.

00:14:07.577 --> 00:14:08.870
Here, sit down.

00:14:08.953 --> 00:14:10.372
-Can I get some water?
-What?

00:14:10.455 --> 00:14:13.291
-Water, please.
-Water? I got it.

00:14:14.376 --> 00:14:16.211
Water. Right, water.

00:14:20.965 --> 00:14:22.717
Water.

00:14:22.801 --> 00:14:23.677
Here we go.

00:14:24.636 --> 00:14:25.595
No, wait.

00:14:37.565 --> 00:14:40.110
A bowl of soup would be nice.

00:14:40.694 --> 00:14:42.862
Some soup.

00:15:50.013 --> 00:15:51.806
Are you really Melomaster?

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:53.808
Were you playing me?

00:15:54.309 --> 00:15:56.060
Was it fun watching me
make a fool out of myself?

00:16:02.317 --> 00:16:05.195
It looks like Crime Revolution
will be the biggest topic

00:16:05.278 --> 00:16:07.113
at next week's press screenings.

00:16:07.989 --> 00:16:11.201
Jung Ji-seok will be attending
the press screening for Crime Revolution,

00:16:11.284 --> 00:16:13.536
so ask him if he's settled
with the bullying victim.

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.247
If he avoids the question,
ask the director why he cast Jung Ji-seok.

00:16:16.331 --> 00:16:17.874
Yes, ma'am.

00:16:21.252 --> 00:16:22.712
Where's Wi Jeong-sin?

00:16:23.671 --> 00:16:25.256
She didn't come in today.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.050
Without notice? Have you called her?

00:16:28.134 --> 00:16:29.260
Did you try calling?

00:16:29.761 --> 00:16:32.138
-No.
-I don't know her number.

00:16:33.139 --> 00:16:34.265
What's the matter with you all?

00:16:35.225 --> 00:16:37.143
Your colleague didn't show up for work,

00:16:37.227 --> 00:16:38.394
but none of you called her?

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.689
She wrote an article in the ER
despite having a burst appendix.

00:16:41.773 --> 00:16:43.358
Do you think she'd skip
the weekly meeting without notice?

00:16:45.443 --> 00:16:46.528
What are you waiting for?

00:16:46.611 --> 00:16:47.737
Call her right now.

00:17:17.725 --> 00:17:18.726
Hello?

00:17:19.769 --> 00:17:20.603
Hello?

00:17:21.896 --> 00:17:24.190
Hello? Isn't this Wi Jeong-sin's phone?

00:17:27.443 --> 00:17:28.319
Hello?

00:17:29.737 --> 00:17:31.948
What's going on? Did she pick up or what?

00:17:33.867 --> 00:17:36.786
Excuse me? Hello? Hey, Wi Jeong-sin.

00:17:39.372 --> 00:17:40.248
Hello?

00:17:41.499 --> 00:17:42.709
Damn it.

00:17:42.792 --> 00:17:45.169
Wi Jeong-sin, answer me.
Is everything okay?

00:17:46.337 --> 00:17:47.380
Hello?

00:17:58.558 --> 00:17:59.475
Hello?

00:18:00.101 --> 00:18:01.978
You've called Ms. Wi Jeong-sin's phone.

00:18:02.061 --> 00:18:03.897
Oh, I'm not her.

00:18:04.522 --> 00:18:06.983
She can't come to the phone right now.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:09.903
All right, thank you.

00:18:15.116 --> 00:18:16.868
She can't come in because she's sick.

00:18:17.785 --> 00:18:18.620
Did Wi Jeong-sin say that?

00:18:18.703 --> 00:18:19.704
No.

00:18:19.787 --> 00:18:20.955
Her younger brother answered.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.168
She must be really sick
if she can't even answer the phone.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.047
-Start the weekly briefing.
-Yes, ma'am.

00:18:29.714 --> 00:18:31.090
Let's begin.

00:18:32.175 --> 00:18:35.178
The name we need to take note of
is Yun Tae-ju.

00:18:35.261 --> 00:18:38.097
-Come to my office for a minute.
-We're going to cover him in depth.

00:18:38.181 --> 00:18:40.725
-Ho-cheol and Seong-min will take this on.
-Sure.

00:18:44.354 --> 00:18:47.482
Has the K-pop trend report

00:18:48.316 --> 00:18:51.402
from our last discussion been completed?

00:18:51.486 --> 00:18:52.737
It's still ongoing.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:56.074
It's still in the early stages,
so there's nothing further to report.

00:18:56.157 --> 00:18:58.076
We only started two days ago, after all.

00:18:59.994 --> 00:19:01.663
Right. Two days.

00:19:03.581 --> 00:19:07.043
Are there any issues
in the editorial department?

00:19:07.126 --> 00:19:07.961
No.

00:19:08.795 --> 00:19:09.712
Should there be?

00:19:09.796 --> 00:19:11.965
Well, that's good to hear.

00:19:12.048 --> 00:19:13.091
Will that be all?

00:19:13.883 --> 00:19:14.801
Well…

00:19:15.343 --> 00:19:16.761
how's Jae-ha?

00:19:18.262 --> 00:19:19.180
Is he feeling better?

00:19:24.477 --> 00:19:26.062
Yes, he's doing better.

00:19:27.188 --> 00:19:28.940
He seemed like a cute kid.

00:19:30.191 --> 00:19:31.109
And nice too.

00:19:32.485 --> 00:19:33.319
He's sweet.

00:19:33.903 --> 00:19:35.780
It's tough sometimes, but he's sweet.

00:19:36.364 --> 00:19:38.074
"Sweet" doesn't even begin to cover it.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.617
You seem happy.

00:19:41.244 --> 00:19:43.871
I'm still not used to you being a mom,

00:19:43.955 --> 00:19:45.206
but you look happy.

00:19:45.289 --> 00:19:46.457
That's good to hear.

00:19:48.084 --> 00:19:48.918
By the way,

00:19:49.419 --> 00:19:52.463
I noticed your kid's name is Yun Jae-ha.

00:19:53.006 --> 00:19:54.841
Was "Yun" your ex-husband's last name,

00:19:54.924 --> 00:19:56.968
or did he take your surname?

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.430
Does he see his dad from time to time?

00:20:01.222 --> 00:20:02.140
Why do you want to know?

00:20:03.266 --> 00:20:04.142
Oh…

00:20:06.394 --> 00:20:07.770
Was that rude to ask?

00:20:08.354 --> 00:20:10.023
Just because you took me to the hospital

00:20:10.106 --> 00:20:12.817
doesn't give you the right
to ask about my private life.

00:20:13.776 --> 00:20:14.652
I'm sorry.

00:20:15.862 --> 00:20:16.779
I shouldn't have asked.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.288
The way you quickly back down
and apologize

00:20:25.371 --> 00:20:26.789
hasn't changed at all.

00:20:26.873 --> 00:20:28.082
How cute.

00:20:28.791 --> 00:20:29.625
Cute?

00:20:30.543 --> 00:20:33.004
I like that you're showing me interest.

00:20:50.772 --> 00:20:51.856
Jae-ha.

00:20:51.939 --> 00:20:53.066
Mom!

00:20:53.149 --> 00:20:55.902
Are you okay? You must've been so scared.

00:20:55.985 --> 00:20:56.819
Yeah.

00:20:56.903 --> 00:20:59.614
I was a little scared, but it was okay.

00:21:00.198 --> 00:21:01.908
Did you cry, Mom?

00:21:02.533 --> 00:21:03.409
Yes.

00:21:04.118 --> 00:21:06.704
I cried because I was afraid
you were badly hurt.

00:21:06.788 --> 00:21:07.872
Good job.

00:21:07.955 --> 00:21:12.001
You said that it's okay to cry
when you're scared, remember?

00:21:13.086 --> 00:21:16.130
Anyway, who's that man over there?

00:21:17.256 --> 00:21:18.216
What?

00:21:19.926 --> 00:21:20.760
Oh.

00:21:21.928 --> 00:21:22.970
Hi there.

00:21:27.266 --> 00:21:30.061
Who the hell is this ex-husband bastard?

00:21:55.169 --> 00:21:56.045
Oh, boy.

00:22:00.424 --> 00:22:01.676
HWANG JI-SUN

00:22:21.779 --> 00:22:22.905
Hello?

00:22:22.989 --> 00:22:24.699
Bro, where are you?

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.120
Look, I'm really sorry.

00:22:29.203 --> 00:22:32.790
Can you clear my schedule for just today?

00:22:32.874 --> 00:22:35.585
What excuse can I make up
to clear your schedule at the last minute?

00:22:35.668 --> 00:22:37.545
Just tell them that I'm sick.

00:22:37.628 --> 00:22:39.380
Who'll believe that? Would you believe it?

00:22:41.048 --> 00:22:43.551
I was planning on showing up if I could.

00:22:43.634 --> 00:22:44.886
But sometimes in life,

00:22:44.969 --> 00:22:48.681
situations come up
that are just out of your control.

00:22:50.808 --> 00:22:51.684
Mr. Hwang.

00:22:52.518 --> 00:22:54.812
Today is that day for me.

00:22:54.896 --> 00:22:56.189
Come on, seriously?

00:22:56.898 --> 00:22:58.149
Fine, I got it.

00:22:58.232 --> 00:22:59.192
But listen, bro.

00:22:59.692 --> 00:23:01.819
This is the last time, okay?

00:23:03.696 --> 00:23:05.364
All right. Thanks.

00:23:05.448 --> 00:23:07.575
You're the best.

00:23:11.621 --> 00:23:12.705
Seriously…

00:23:18.085 --> 00:23:19.337
Are you kidding me, Mr. Hwang?

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.756
He wants to clear
his entire schedule for the day?

00:23:22.423 --> 00:23:24.050
I'm truly sorry, Director.

00:23:24.133 --> 00:23:26.719
Most of the scenes
scheduled for today are Mr. Lim's.

00:23:26.802 --> 00:23:29.096
If he's not here,
we'll have to wrap up after two scenes.

00:23:29.805 --> 00:23:31.224
I know.

00:23:31.307 --> 00:23:34.352
But I swear, his fever's hit 48 degrees.

00:23:34.435 --> 00:23:35.603
Forty-eight--

00:23:41.359 --> 00:23:43.861
He'd be dead if he had a 48-degree fever.

00:23:47.114 --> 00:23:47.949
Here.

00:23:49.325 --> 00:23:50.826
I heated up the soup.

00:23:53.537 --> 00:23:54.538
Thank you.

00:23:56.082 --> 00:23:58.918
Have some bread and the banana too.

00:24:02.588 --> 00:24:05.007
I also ordered some rice porridge.

00:24:06.217 --> 00:24:07.051
Tell me if you want some.

00:24:07.134 --> 00:24:08.010
You had

00:24:08.928 --> 00:24:10.846
so many chances to come clean.

00:24:12.807 --> 00:24:14.850
Empathy isn't my strong suit,

00:24:15.393 --> 00:24:16.435
but I thought long and hard.

00:24:17.311 --> 00:24:18.854
I tried to put myself in your shoes

00:24:19.355 --> 00:24:20.731
and racked my brain.

00:24:21.857 --> 00:24:22.733
When I said…

00:24:25.444 --> 00:24:27.363
When I said I was a fan of Lim Hyeon-jun…

00:24:29.073 --> 00:24:31.409
I could see why you got curious about me.

00:24:32.118 --> 00:24:33.494
-But that--
-Let me speak.

00:24:35.371 --> 00:24:37.748
-Okay.
-I joined your fan page,

00:24:38.249 --> 00:24:39.166
spoke to you on the phone,

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:40.918
asked you to do an impression,

00:24:41.961 --> 00:24:44.630
and mustered up my courage
to ask you to meet me,

00:24:45.965 --> 00:24:47.508
yet you sent someone else in your place.

00:24:51.304 --> 00:24:52.179
I mean…

00:24:53.556 --> 00:24:54.598
I just…

00:24:55.516 --> 00:24:58.019
I've never felt like
such an idiot in my life.

00:24:58.602 --> 00:24:59.729
I don't understand this feeling.

00:25:00.396 --> 00:25:02.606
I don't even know how to explain it!

00:25:05.735 --> 00:25:09.155
Listen, it was a complete shock for me too

00:25:09.238 --> 00:25:11.574
when I saw you
at the N Seoul Tower that day.

00:25:11.657 --> 00:25:13.492
My mind went completely blank.

00:25:15.244 --> 00:25:16.287
But then…

00:25:17.621 --> 00:25:19.457
the more I thought about it,

00:25:20.374 --> 00:25:21.500
the more I realized

00:25:22.501 --> 00:25:23.544
that this whole time…

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.090
I've had feelings for you.

00:25:29.342 --> 00:25:30.968
That's why I deleted Onion.

00:25:31.052 --> 00:25:33.888
So that means
you had no feelings for Soulishere.

00:25:35.389 --> 00:25:37.183
No, that's not true.

00:25:37.266 --> 00:25:38.309
Hearing that I was a fan,

00:25:38.392 --> 00:25:40.936
you must've messaged me just for fun.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.314
I told you it wasn't like that.

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:47.651
I like both Soulishere and Wi Jeong-sin.

00:25:47.735 --> 00:25:49.278
That's called two-timing!

00:25:49.362 --> 00:25:51.864
No, that would only apply
if there were two different people.

00:25:51.947 --> 00:25:54.033
You and Soulishere are the same person.

00:25:54.116 --> 00:25:55.117
So you're proud of what you did?

00:26:05.836 --> 00:26:06.670
Ms. Wi Jeong-sin.

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.006
I told you earlier

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:11.842
that it'll take time
to wrap your head around this.

00:26:11.926 --> 00:26:13.260
It took me a while too.

00:26:14.428 --> 00:26:16.097
I know you're impatient,

00:26:16.722 --> 00:26:19.683
but don't rush
and take your time to think about it.

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:22.103
I can wait as long as you need.

00:26:23.813 --> 00:26:24.897
Everything about it makes me angry.

00:26:26.732 --> 00:26:27.983
Are you leaving like this again?

00:26:28.526 --> 00:26:29.610
Eat something before you go.

00:26:29.693 --> 00:26:30.778
I can't eat anything right now.

00:26:30.861 --> 00:26:32.446
Then let me take you home--

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:33.614
No, thank you.

00:26:34.198 --> 00:26:35.074
I want to go alone.

00:26:37.201 --> 00:26:38.244
Come on, Ms. Wi.

00:26:38.828 --> 00:26:39.787
I'll leave by myself.

00:26:59.265 --> 00:27:01.475
How can I get her to stop being mad?

00:27:02.309 --> 00:27:05.438
I mean, I wouldn't blame her
if she never wants to see me again.

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:08.524
Wait.

00:27:10.025 --> 00:27:11.861
Maybe I shouldn't have
confessed empty-handed.

00:27:11.944 --> 00:27:14.655
Should I have gotten her
a new rice cooker?

00:27:14.738 --> 00:27:16.157
Jeez, you idiot!

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.534
The rice cooker isn't the issue, you fool!

00:27:22.705 --> 00:27:26.625
If I give this back to her now,
she'll never see me again.

00:27:27.501 --> 00:27:28.502
WI JEONG-SIN

00:27:34.049 --> 00:27:36.677
-This boxed lunch is delicious.
-Is she really sick?

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.179
-Ms. Wi is here.
-Yeah, it's good.

00:27:38.888 --> 00:27:41.056
-Hello, Ms. Wi.
-Do you feel okay?

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:41.974
Are you okay?

00:27:42.057 --> 00:27:45.102
We heard you were sick.
You should rest some more.

00:27:45.186 --> 00:27:46.562
Have you eaten yet?

00:27:46.645 --> 00:27:48.898
-Are you okay?
-She doesn't look okay.

00:27:50.649 --> 00:27:52.067
I've never seen her like this before.

00:27:52.151 --> 00:27:53.277
Should we tell the chief?

00:27:53.819 --> 00:27:56.697
Leave her alone.
She can take care of herself.

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:01.619
I like both Soulishere and Wi Jeong-sin.

00:28:02.328 --> 00:28:03.704
I told you earlier

00:28:04.288 --> 00:28:07.208
that it'll take time
to wrap your head around this.

00:28:07.291 --> 00:28:08.584
It took me a while too.

00:28:08.667 --> 00:28:10.586
I know you're impatient,

00:28:11.212 --> 00:28:14.173
but don't rush
and take your time to think about it.

00:28:15.299 --> 00:28:16.842
I can wait as long as you need.

00:28:17.718 --> 00:28:18.594
What's going on?

00:28:22.973 --> 00:28:24.266
-What's wrong?
-Are you okay?

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:25.559
She must really be sick.

00:28:38.531 --> 00:28:39.490
Wi Jeong-sin.

00:28:44.036 --> 00:28:44.995
Are you all right?

00:28:46.372 --> 00:28:47.831
Yes, I'm fine.

00:28:48.415 --> 00:28:50.292
But you're not acting like yourself.

00:28:50.376 --> 00:28:53.128
Get some more rest if you're sick,
or get it together and get to work.

00:28:53.212 --> 00:28:54.713
Choose one or the other.

00:28:54.797 --> 00:28:56.006
I'm sorry.

00:28:56.924 --> 00:28:58.509
I'll get it together and get to work.

00:29:23.117 --> 00:29:24.326
I…

00:29:25.786 --> 00:29:26.620
like you.

00:29:41.427 --> 00:29:43.304
Time to take out the trash.

00:29:43.971 --> 00:29:45.347
-Let's go!
-You're home.

00:29:53.272 --> 00:29:54.690
I'll wait for you.

00:30:02.656 --> 00:30:03.824
I like you.

00:30:07.995 --> 00:30:09.371
So, Detective.

00:30:10.581 --> 00:30:11.915
I see you like flowers.

00:30:12.499 --> 00:30:13.626
I like them.

00:30:13.709 --> 00:30:15.169
Please just stop!

00:30:17.963 --> 00:30:18.964
Sister.

00:30:22.885 --> 00:30:26.013
I'm going to sell that! I really am!

00:30:26.597 --> 00:30:27.514
Box it up right now!

00:30:27.598 --> 00:30:28.474
I'll wait for you.

00:30:29.391 --> 00:30:30.309
And this…

00:30:31.518 --> 00:30:33.479
Yeon-ju said to give this to you.

00:30:39.401 --> 00:30:41.028
I'm so pissed that I got fooled,

00:30:41.111 --> 00:30:42.571
but I can't stop thinking about him!

00:30:46.075 --> 00:30:47.034
I like you.

00:30:47.785 --> 00:30:48.952
I'll wait for you.

00:30:49.662 --> 00:30:50.704
I like you.

00:30:51.246 --> 00:30:52.373
I'll wait for you.

00:30:59.588 --> 00:31:00.547
He really

00:31:01.465 --> 00:31:02.341
likes me?

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:04.510
Lim Hyeon-jun likes me?

00:31:07.137 --> 00:31:08.180
Open wide.

00:31:08.263 --> 00:31:09.723
LIM HYEON-JUN & REPORTER W OPENLY DATING

00:31:09.807 --> 00:31:12.184
A reporter should be
covering stories, not dating.

00:31:12.851 --> 00:31:13.936
They're not a good fit.

00:31:14.019 --> 00:31:16.188
Honestly, I'd be a better fit.

00:31:17.147 --> 00:31:19.274
Get away from my man.

00:31:20.067 --> 00:31:21.777
I'd rather see him with Jin Su-a again.

00:31:22.361 --> 00:31:25.322
Don't you think
he's way out of her league?

00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:31.829
You lost this major exclusive
to another media outlet?

00:31:31.912 --> 00:31:32.955
But Chief…

00:31:33.038 --> 00:31:36.417
Another outlet beat us to the exclusive
about you and Lim Hyeon-jun!

00:31:39.628 --> 00:31:40.671
Take this money

00:31:40.754 --> 00:31:42.506
and stay away from my son.

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:45.008
-Mother…
-Who are you calling "Mother"?

00:31:45.092 --> 00:31:47.636
My son is destined for greater things.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.555
How dare you stand in his way?

00:31:50.472 --> 00:31:54.226
But we genuinely love each other.

00:31:56.645 --> 00:31:57.646
Mother!

00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:58.814
Break up with him this instant,

00:31:58.897 --> 00:32:00.441
or I'll slap you with kimchi next time!

00:32:00.524 --> 00:32:01.900
But Mother…

00:32:04.987 --> 00:32:06.155
Have I really lost it?

00:32:06.905 --> 00:32:07.990
I like you.

00:32:09.199 --> 00:32:10.200
Snap out of it!

00:32:10.284 --> 00:32:11.994
Come on, Jeong-sin!

00:32:12.077 --> 00:32:13.078
I'll wait for you.

00:32:15.205 --> 00:32:16.039
It's not true.

00:32:17.166 --> 00:32:19.042
It's not true.

00:32:19.835 --> 00:32:20.669
It's not true.

00:32:20.753 --> 00:32:22.004
-It's not true.
-I like you.

00:32:22.087 --> 00:32:23.255
It's not true.

00:32:23.881 --> 00:32:25.257
-Thank you.
-Here you go.

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:26.759
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

00:32:26.842 --> 00:32:27.801
Thank you.

00:32:27.885 --> 00:32:30.137
-I'll take the smallest one.
-Move along.

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:31.472
-Keep handing these out.
-Got it.

00:32:31.555 --> 00:32:33.599
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:32:33.682 --> 00:32:35.601
-Thanks so much!
-You're welcome.

00:32:35.684 --> 00:32:37.978
-Thank you.
-When did you prepare this?

00:32:38.061 --> 00:32:39.062
It's nothing.

00:32:39.146 --> 00:32:41.356
-Is it to make up for skipping the shoot?
-Come on.

00:32:42.608 --> 00:32:44.568
-Thank you!
-Thanks so much!

00:32:44.651 --> 00:32:47.446
-Season six, here we come!
-This is awesome!

00:32:47.529 --> 00:32:48.864
They really love it.

00:32:49.406 --> 00:32:50.783
I need to stop by the restroom.

00:32:51.283 --> 00:32:52.451
What's gotten into him?

00:32:53.368 --> 00:32:55.204
-Hey, he's gone.
-Really?

00:32:57.247 --> 00:32:58.999
Man, the letters are huge.

00:32:59.541 --> 00:33:00.918
As if we'd ever wear these out.

00:33:01.001 --> 00:33:03.086
Right? I'd rather he not skip a shoot

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:05.130
than try to make up for it
with these T-shirts and caps.

00:33:05.214 --> 00:33:06.048
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

00:33:08.675 --> 00:33:11.094
-Twist the arm.
-And block.

00:33:11.178 --> 00:33:13.514
Duck once, duck twice.

00:33:13.597 --> 00:33:14.598
Then punch.

00:33:14.681 --> 00:33:15.516
Hold on.

00:33:16.809 --> 00:33:17.684
I need to see Seok-ho alone.

00:33:18.352 --> 00:33:19.520
-Come with me.
-You didn't like it?

00:33:20.604 --> 00:33:22.856
-Mr. Lim, I'll rehearse with you.
-Sounds good.

00:33:24.525 --> 00:33:26.068
-Is your ankle okay now?
-My ankle?

00:33:26.151 --> 00:33:28.070
Yes, you hurt your ankle last time.

00:33:28.153 --> 00:33:30.697
I told them I can't do any stunts today
because I hurt my ankle.

00:33:30.781 --> 00:33:31.949
I really did.

00:33:34.368 --> 00:33:37.079
I'll be doing my own scenes today

00:33:37.162 --> 00:33:38.705
without a stunt double.

00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:39.665
Does that mean

00:33:40.249 --> 00:33:42.459
you did your own stunts that day,
knowing I was hurt?

00:33:45.879 --> 00:33:46.922
Are you okay now?

00:33:47.005 --> 00:33:48.423
Yes, I'm fine now.

00:33:48.507 --> 00:33:49.967
That's good to hear.

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:51.802
All right, let's rehearse our moves.

00:33:51.885 --> 00:33:54.012
-Right, let me explain how it goes first.
-Okay.

00:33:54.096 --> 00:33:55.222
-Seok-ho will…
-Wait,

00:33:55.305 --> 00:33:57.099
so what's the deal with the ballpoint pen?

00:33:57.182 --> 00:33:59.309
When Seok-ho attacks you with the pen,

00:33:59.393 --> 00:34:02.104
you twist his arm
and force him to drop it.

00:34:02.187 --> 00:34:04.523
-Then follow up with a punch and a kick.
-Do it precisely.

00:34:04.606 --> 00:34:06.942
Sorry, I'll be the one throwing the punch.

00:34:07.025 --> 00:34:08.277
Okay, got it.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.363
All right, let's start from the beginning.

00:34:11.446 --> 00:34:12.656
Sounds good.

00:34:27.254 --> 00:34:28.088
Damn it!

00:34:34.136 --> 00:34:36.054
-Cut!
-Cut!

00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:37.931
-Oh, man.
-Jeez.

00:34:38.432 --> 00:34:39.766
-Did that hurt?
-Are you okay?

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:41.518
No, I'm not okay.

00:34:41.602 --> 00:34:43.312
-Did he hurt his back?
-Step out for a minute.

00:34:43.896 --> 00:34:45.230
-Come on, let's go.
-Oh, my back.

00:34:45.814 --> 00:34:47.691
Hey, help him up.

00:34:49.651 --> 00:34:51.236
We'll take a quick break.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.405
-Let's break briefly!
-We'll take a quick break!

00:34:53.488 --> 00:34:54.615
-Mr. Lim.
-Yes?

00:34:55.115 --> 00:34:56.992
You rehearsed the sequence earlier, right?

00:34:57.075 --> 00:34:58.035
Of course.

00:34:58.118 --> 00:35:00.913
You twist his arm
and force him to drop it.

00:35:00.996 --> 00:35:02.956
Then follow up with a punch and a kick.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:06.501
In this scene,
you're supposed to block Seok-ho's attack,

00:35:06.585 --> 00:35:09.838
force the pen out of his hand,
and then kick the pen away.

00:35:12.049 --> 00:35:13.425
Oh, kick the pen?

00:35:14.676 --> 00:35:17.554
We'll resume shooting
after you rehearse with the stunt team.

00:35:39.117 --> 00:35:40.702
Lim Hyeon-jun is unbelievable.

00:35:40.786 --> 00:35:41.912
"Exceptional love for his crew"?

00:35:41.995 --> 00:35:43.580
He handed out those gifts
for this article.

00:35:43.664 --> 00:35:45.499
Sang-hyeok,
share the link in our group chat.

00:35:45.582 --> 00:35:47.417
Hey, that's enough.

00:35:47.501 --> 00:35:49.086
I'm sure Mr. Lim
gave out the gifts because he cares,

00:35:49.169 --> 00:35:50.587
not for some article.

00:35:50.671 --> 00:35:51.797
He wouldn't do that.

00:35:55.175 --> 00:35:56.635
You're too kind, Director.

00:35:57.678 --> 00:35:59.680
We're behind schedule
because he skipped that shoot,

00:35:59.763 --> 00:36:02.307
and we lost so much money
leaving the set early that day.

00:36:03.183 --> 00:36:04.267
Mr. Lim had his reasons--

00:36:04.351 --> 00:36:07.396
He should've at least rehearsed properly
to make up for things then.

00:36:07.479 --> 00:36:10.107
He ended up hurting an actor,
so now there's another delay.

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:11.608
This isn't right.

00:36:13.902 --> 00:36:15.570
He says his arm hurts?

00:36:17.698 --> 00:36:18.991
How high is his fever?

00:36:20.492 --> 00:36:21.743
Did you give him a fever reducer?

00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:25.038
Okay.

00:36:25.622 --> 00:36:28.667
It's just that I can't leave right away,

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:31.128
and Jae-ha's nanny
isn't scheduled to come in today.

00:36:32.087 --> 00:36:34.965
I'll make sure to get there by 5 p.m.

00:36:43.765 --> 00:36:47.853
I'd like you to take a moment
to think about how you really feel.

00:36:48.562 --> 00:36:50.647
At the end of your gaze,

00:36:50.731 --> 00:36:53.025
it was always the chief.

00:36:53.775 --> 00:36:57.362
As if she were a child
you left behind and couldn't forget.

00:37:10.083 --> 00:37:10.917
Mom!

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:12.586
Jae-ha.

00:37:43.784 --> 00:37:44.993
This smells great.

00:37:54.503 --> 00:37:55.337
Thank you.

00:37:58.423 --> 00:38:01.051
I won't be able to go
to the set of Kang Pil-gu,

00:38:01.134 --> 00:38:03.095
so please send another reporter.

00:38:04.763 --> 00:38:05.806
Why'd you change your mind again?

00:38:06.515 --> 00:38:08.266
Well, I can't get into the details.

00:38:08.934 --> 00:38:10.393
But I have my reasons.

00:38:11.603 --> 00:38:12.687
And what are those reasons?

00:38:13.271 --> 00:38:15.357
Did Lim Hyeon-jun
confess his feelings or something?

00:38:19.152 --> 00:38:20.112
How did you know?

00:38:21.071 --> 00:38:21.905
Is it true?

00:38:23.198 --> 00:38:25.450
No, it's not like that.

00:38:25.534 --> 00:38:27.410
In any case, I can't go there myself.

00:38:27.494 --> 00:38:29.621
So please send someone else. I'm sorry.

00:38:35.585 --> 00:38:38.130
I guess it was worth teaming up with him.

00:38:43.677 --> 00:38:44.678
This is great.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.055
"Is this place a joke to you?"

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:51.101
"If you wanted to post photos,
you should've posted food photos!"

00:38:52.394 --> 00:38:53.645
"Why'd you post photos of…"

00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.234
Hi.

00:39:02.571 --> 00:39:03.989
"Why'd you post photos of the office?"

00:39:32.726 --> 00:39:36.104
LIM HYEON-JUN

00:39:36.188 --> 00:39:37.022
LIM HYEON-JUN

00:39:40.525 --> 00:39:42.110
LIM HYEON-JUN

00:39:47.324 --> 00:39:49.910
"Is this place a joke to you?"

00:39:55.081 --> 00:39:55.957
REPORTER WI JEONG-SIN

00:40:16.853 --> 00:40:17.729
Hello?

00:40:18.855 --> 00:40:19.898
It's me, Wi Jeong-sin.

00:40:20.482 --> 00:40:21.775
Yes, I know.

00:40:23.151 --> 00:40:24.945
You have a shoot today, right?

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:26.613
Hong-sin told me.

00:40:26.696 --> 00:40:27.989
Yes, I do.

00:40:29.491 --> 00:40:31.243
When will you be done?

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:33.536
I want to see you.

00:40:34.037 --> 00:40:34.871
What?

00:40:36.164 --> 00:40:37.749
Are you busy today?

00:40:37.832 --> 00:40:38.959
-Then maybe another--
-Wait.

00:40:39.709 --> 00:40:41.086
No, no.

00:40:41.169 --> 00:40:42.254
Today works fine.

00:40:42.337 --> 00:40:45.298
I have a morning and night shoot today,

00:40:45.382 --> 00:40:47.133
so I have some time in between.

00:40:48.134 --> 00:40:49.803
How about 4 o'clock?

00:40:49.886 --> 00:40:50.720
Wait, no.

00:40:50.804 --> 00:40:52.430
How about 3 o'clock?

00:40:53.473 --> 00:40:54.808
I'll see you at 3 o'clock then.

00:40:55.392 --> 00:40:58.019
Let me know where,
and I'll meet you there.

00:41:00.689 --> 00:41:01.982
Okay. I'll see you later.

00:41:02.607 --> 00:41:03.608
Okay.

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.321
I want to see you.

00:41:20.125 --> 00:41:21.209
So suddenly?

00:41:21.293 --> 00:41:22.294
I want to see you.

00:41:28.842 --> 00:41:29.676
Hey, bro.

00:41:34.055 --> 00:41:35.265
-Bro, what are you doing?
-Huh?

00:41:35.348 --> 00:41:36.182
You okay?

00:41:36.266 --> 00:41:37.100
Yeah.

00:41:43.982 --> 00:41:44.858
Is it another panic attack?

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:48.028
I don't think so.

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:52.324
Mr. Lim, let's do a quick rehearsal.

00:41:52.407 --> 00:41:53.658
-Right.
-Okay.

00:41:53.742 --> 00:41:55.201
-Yeong-gi, you need to watch.
-Yes, sir.

00:41:55.285 --> 00:41:56.119
Good.

00:41:57.245 --> 00:41:58.705
-Get it together.
-Okay.

00:41:58.788 --> 00:42:02.459
Pil-gu walks through the entrance
looking angry.

00:42:02.542 --> 00:42:04.085
And as soon as he sees Yeong-gi,

00:42:04.169 --> 00:42:06.629
he runs, grabs him by the collar,
and delivers his lines.

00:42:06.713 --> 00:42:08.757
Yeong-gi is caught off guard,
so he just takes it.

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.008
-Got it, sir.
-Good.

00:42:13.136 --> 00:42:14.346
I want to see you.

00:42:16.139 --> 00:42:17.724
-Mr. Lim.
-What?

00:42:17.807 --> 00:42:19.267
Did you get that?

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:21.978
Grab him by the collar?

00:42:22.062 --> 00:42:23.521
Yes, and then deliver your lines.

00:42:23.605 --> 00:42:24.981
-Okay.
-Good.

00:42:26.274 --> 00:42:28.985
Okay? Okay, let's get ready.

00:42:29.611 --> 00:42:30.653
-Now?
-Get ready to roll!

00:42:31.237 --> 00:42:32.614
All right, ready…

00:42:32.697 --> 00:42:33.656
Ready!

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:35.325
-Action!
-Action!

00:42:36.785 --> 00:42:39.287
You punk! Is this place a joke to you?

00:42:39.371 --> 00:42:41.331
You idiot!

00:42:42.374 --> 00:42:45.710
If you wanted to post photos,
you should've posted food photos…

00:42:45.794 --> 00:42:46.795
Wait.

00:42:48.296 --> 00:42:50.423
-Why am I kneeling?
-Cut.

00:42:50.507 --> 00:42:51.508
Action.

00:42:51.591 --> 00:42:53.968
You punk! Is this place a joke to you?

00:42:54.052 --> 00:42:55.845
You idiot!

00:42:56.554 --> 00:42:59.057
Wait a minute. Why is he so tall?

00:42:59.766 --> 00:43:00.600
Wait.

00:43:01.601 --> 00:43:02.602
That was a great take.

00:43:03.395 --> 00:43:04.270
Was it?

00:43:04.354 --> 00:43:05.188
I'm sorry.

00:43:05.271 --> 00:43:06.564
Let's try that again.

00:43:07.649 --> 00:43:08.650
Action!

00:43:10.402 --> 00:43:12.987
You punk! Is this place a joke to you?

00:43:13.071 --> 00:43:13.905
You idiot!

00:43:13.988 --> 00:43:16.658
If you wanted to post photos,
you should've posted food photos!

00:43:16.741 --> 00:43:19.202
Why'd you post photos of the office?

00:43:19.285 --> 00:43:23.998
Because of you, all the files got leaked…

00:43:24.999 --> 00:43:26.668
They got leaked, you idiot!

00:43:26.751 --> 00:43:28.002
-Leaked…
-Cut.

00:43:28.086 --> 00:43:30.797
-Damn it.
-Someone read Mr. Lim his lines.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.758
-Read it out to him.
-"Is this place a joke to you?"

00:43:33.842 --> 00:43:35.093
Action!

00:43:35.176 --> 00:43:37.637
You punk! Is this place a joke to you?

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:38.596
You idiot!

00:43:39.139 --> 00:43:42.976
If you wanted to post photos,
you should've posted food photos!

00:43:43.059 --> 00:43:44.853
Why'd you post photos of the office?

00:43:48.189 --> 00:43:50.483
Cut.

00:43:50.567 --> 00:43:51.734
Hold on.

00:43:52.277 --> 00:43:53.111
-Cut.
-I feel dizzy.

00:43:54.279 --> 00:43:56.739
Hey, what's the next line?

00:43:56.823 --> 00:43:57.782
Can he not see this?

00:43:57.866 --> 00:43:58.825
Damn it!

00:43:59.868 --> 00:44:03.246
-Guys, feed me the lines quickly, okay?
-Okay.

00:44:03.329 --> 00:44:04.622
-Right, sir.
-Sorry.

00:44:04.706 --> 00:44:06.458
-No, not at all.
-Let's hurry it up!

00:44:06.541 --> 00:44:07.500
I'm sorry.

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.211
-I'm very sorry.
-Right.

00:44:10.295 --> 00:44:11.212
It's okay.

00:44:12.422 --> 00:44:13.798
Ready!

00:44:16.551 --> 00:44:17.886
Action!

00:44:18.553 --> 00:44:21.055
You punk! Is this place a joke to you?

00:44:21.139 --> 00:44:22.015
You idiot!

00:44:22.098 --> 00:44:25.393
If you wanted to post photos,
you should've posted food photos!

00:44:25.477 --> 00:44:29.397
Why'd you post photos
of the office, you punk?

00:44:29.481 --> 00:44:31.274
Is this place… You punk!

00:44:31.357 --> 00:44:33.067
Why you… You idiot!

00:44:33.943 --> 00:44:35.904
Seriously, what's the matter with me?

00:44:35.987 --> 00:44:38.031
Cut!

00:44:39.282 --> 00:44:42.452
Mr. Lim, let's take a five-minute break.

00:44:54.964 --> 00:44:56.591
When will you be done?

00:44:57.342 --> 00:44:58.426
I want to see you.

00:45:11.064 --> 00:45:13.107
Bro, what's going on?

00:45:13.942 --> 00:45:14.776
What?

00:45:18.571 --> 00:45:21.866
Bro, you look totally out of it.

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:22.784
Do I?

00:45:22.867 --> 00:45:24.077
The way I see it,

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:26.412
there's no way
you're delivering your lines today.

00:45:26.496 --> 00:45:28.248
That's not true.

00:45:28.331 --> 00:45:31.251
I know all my lines,
but my mind just goes blank.

00:45:31.334 --> 00:45:32.544
Be honest with me.

00:45:32.627 --> 00:45:34.712
Is it a panic attack? Or dementia?

00:45:35.296 --> 00:45:37.590
I can't help you if you don't tell me.

00:45:37.674 --> 00:45:40.802
At this rate, we won't get through
half of today's scenes.

00:45:45.014 --> 00:45:46.432
I suppose it's a panic attack then.

00:45:50.019 --> 00:45:50.979
All right.

00:45:52.188 --> 00:45:53.356
I'll work something out.

00:46:07.036 --> 00:46:08.037
Ready.

00:46:08.746 --> 00:46:09.914
Action!

00:46:09.998 --> 00:46:11.291
You punk!

00:46:11.374 --> 00:46:14.419
Is this place a joke to you? You idiot!

00:46:14.502 --> 00:46:17.422
If you wanted to post photos,
you should've posted food photos!

00:46:17.505 --> 00:46:19.465
Why'd you post photos of the office?

00:46:19.549 --> 00:46:22.510
You think this is
your personal playground to show off?

00:46:23.553 --> 00:46:25.263
Because of you, the files got leaked,

00:46:25.346 --> 00:46:28.725
and we lost the suspect
we've been tracking for a whole year!

00:46:28.808 --> 00:46:30.351
And an innocent person had to resign!

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:33.104
This whole place is a mess right now,

00:46:33.187 --> 00:46:34.647
yet you posted more photos?

00:46:35.481 --> 00:46:37.692
And you call yourself a detective,
you damn idiot?

00:46:39.319 --> 00:46:40.236
Get out.

00:46:41.529 --> 00:46:43.072
Get the hell out of here!

00:46:43.156 --> 00:46:44.449
Okay, cut!

00:46:44.532 --> 00:46:46.117
On to the next scene.

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.994
Let's move out
into the hallway for Scene 53!

00:46:48.077 --> 00:46:49.912
Let's move out
into the hallway for Scene 53!

00:46:50.496 --> 00:46:51.539
Good job, bro.

00:46:52.874 --> 00:46:54.667
Oh, boy.

00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:57.629
Come on, get up.

00:46:58.796 --> 00:47:01.841
Man, that was some intense acting.

00:47:04.177 --> 00:47:05.011
We're getting there.

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:07.347
Gil-su, bring him some water.

00:47:10.141 --> 00:47:11.559
When will you be done?

00:47:12.393 --> 00:47:13.478
I want to see you.

00:47:14.979 --> 00:47:16.147
Yes, we're done!

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:18.274
-The night shoot is in Gangnam, right?
-Yeah.

00:47:18.358 --> 00:47:21.653
You two take that car.
Let me borrow yours.

00:47:23.071 --> 00:47:24.364
-My car?
-Yeah.

00:47:24.447 --> 00:47:26.199
-What for?
-Oh, it's for…

00:47:27.867 --> 00:47:28.785
An appointment in Gwanghwamun.

00:47:28.868 --> 00:47:30.036
What appointment?

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.455
-With a friend.
-What friend?

00:47:32.538 --> 00:47:33.706
I know all your friends.

00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:35.583
Mind your own business!

00:47:35.667 --> 00:47:36.668
Can I borrow it or not?

00:47:38.586 --> 00:47:40.713
-Fine. Here.
-It'll take about two hours to get there.

00:47:40.797 --> 00:47:43.424
-I'll drive you there.
-No, it's okay.

00:47:43.508 --> 00:47:47.929
Also, my mom and Ms. Oh Mi-ran
will be shooting a scene together later.

00:47:48.012 --> 00:47:49.305
You should be there, Mr. Hwang.

00:47:49.389 --> 00:47:51.432
Keep an eye on them
in case something happens.

00:47:51.516 --> 00:47:55.186
Come on, they're both professionals.
Relax, nothing will happen.

00:47:55.853 --> 00:47:58.481
How can you say that after last time?

00:47:58.981 --> 00:48:01.192
Wait, which scene are they shooting today?

00:48:01.275 --> 00:48:02.944
I think it's the slapping scene.

00:48:03.528 --> 00:48:04.904
The slapping scene?

00:48:07.865 --> 00:48:08.866
Who's slapping whom?

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:13.121
I think it's your mother
slapping Ms. Oh Mi-ran.

00:48:23.923 --> 00:48:25.508
Cut! Nice job.

00:48:25.591 --> 00:48:27.260
Let's roll with this vibe.

00:48:27.343 --> 00:48:29.053
-Was that okay, Director?
-Yes.

00:48:29.137 --> 00:48:30.221
Let's roll again.

00:48:30.304 --> 00:48:32.181
-Let's roll again!
-Let's roll again!

00:48:37.812 --> 00:48:40.356
-All right. Ready?
-Yes.

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:41.482
Ready.

00:48:42.358 --> 00:48:43.401
Action.

00:48:44.152 --> 00:48:46.863
I can't quit like this, ma'am.

00:48:47.655 --> 00:48:50.533
If I do, it'll make
everything you heard look true.

00:48:50.616 --> 00:48:52.535
If I have to quit, then so be it.

00:48:52.618 --> 00:48:55.079
But I want to clear up
the misunderstanding before I go.

00:48:56.164 --> 00:48:57.206
Why you…

00:48:57.290 --> 00:49:00.877
How dare you act all high and mighty,
you homewrecker!

00:49:01.544 --> 00:49:04.464
Do you really think
I don't know you're only trying to stay

00:49:04.547 --> 00:49:07.884
so you can seduce my soft-hearted husband?

00:49:07.967 --> 00:49:09.260
Ma'am.

00:49:09.343 --> 00:49:11.262
I have my own taste in men.

00:49:11.345 --> 00:49:13.264
Your husband is not my type.

00:49:13.347 --> 00:49:15.892
What did you say?

00:49:16.434 --> 00:49:17.435
Why you…

00:49:19.645 --> 00:49:20.480
Not your type?

00:49:25.568 --> 00:49:27.487
-The scene called for one slap, not two.
-It's once, right?

00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:29.405
She's totally into character.

00:49:32.909 --> 00:49:33.993
Damn you!

00:49:34.994 --> 00:49:35.995
What's going on?

00:49:36.621 --> 00:49:38.998
This doesn't seem right.

00:49:39.081 --> 00:49:39.916
Cut.

00:49:40.583 --> 00:49:42.502
-Cut!
-Cut!

00:49:43.669 --> 00:49:45.004
Cut!

00:49:45.087 --> 00:49:46.297
-Stop!
-Oh, damn it!

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:48.424
-Cut!
-Cut!

00:49:48.508 --> 00:49:51.177
-Cut!
-Stop them!

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:54.263
Stop them! Break them up!

00:50:07.777 --> 00:50:10.071
Ma'am, please calm down!

00:50:14.617 --> 00:50:15.660
Director!

00:50:46.858 --> 00:50:48.109
When will you be done?

00:50:49.193 --> 00:50:50.319
I want to see you.

00:50:51.988 --> 00:50:54.365
Let me know where,
and I'll meet you there.

00:51:18.598 --> 00:51:20.600
I'm here. Take your time.

00:51:47.543 --> 00:51:50.129
I'm here. Take your time.

00:52:31.963 --> 00:52:32.838
You're here.

00:52:33.714 --> 00:52:34.548
Please sit.

00:52:37.218 --> 00:52:38.844
Why are you sitting
where everyone can see you?

00:52:39.428 --> 00:52:40.513
So you can find me easily.

00:52:41.889 --> 00:52:43.015
At least put on your hat.

00:52:45.393 --> 00:52:47.478
I took it off so you'd recognize me.

00:52:48.104 --> 00:52:50.815
Are you worried
about a dating rumor again?

00:52:52.233 --> 00:52:54.276
Who'd start a dating rumor
when you're with a reporter?

00:53:01.701 --> 00:53:03.452
Do you want a drink?
I'll go and order for us.

00:53:03.536 --> 00:53:05.121
-No, I'll go.
-No.

00:53:05.955 --> 00:53:06.914
I'll go.

00:53:06.998 --> 00:53:08.082
What would you like?

00:53:08.958 --> 00:53:10.001
An iced Americano.

00:53:10.084 --> 00:53:11.168
An iced Americano?

00:53:16.173 --> 00:53:17.967
-Please order when you're ready.
-Thank you.

00:53:18.592 --> 00:53:20.094
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:53:20.177 --> 00:53:21.846
-I'm a huge fan!
-I love your show!

00:53:21.929 --> 00:53:23.139
-Can I get a photo with you?
-Sure.

00:53:23.222 --> 00:53:25.808
-Thank you.
-Can I get one with you too?

00:53:25.891 --> 00:53:27.601
No way.

00:53:27.685 --> 00:53:28.686
-Your order?
-An iced Americano, please.

00:53:28.769 --> 00:53:30.229
Sure, two iced Americanos.

00:53:33.315 --> 00:53:34.525
Thank you so much.

00:53:34.608 --> 00:53:36.777
-I've never seen a celebrity before.
-Me too!

00:53:41.157 --> 00:53:41.991
Thank you.

00:53:47.288 --> 00:53:48.873
Jeez, come on.

00:53:48.956 --> 00:53:50.666
What's the matter with him?

00:53:52.043 --> 00:53:53.586
-Hello?
-Bro, where are you?

00:53:53.669 --> 00:53:54.503
Why?

00:53:55.087 --> 00:53:56.505
Our biggest fear came true.

00:53:56.589 --> 00:53:57.465
Where are you?

00:53:57.548 --> 00:53:59.717
Where else? I'm on set, of course.

00:54:01.218 --> 00:54:02.720
You need to get here.

00:54:02.803 --> 00:54:04.055
Right now?

00:54:04.138 --> 00:54:07.558
It was a huge fight
full of hair-pulling and slapping.

00:54:07.641 --> 00:54:09.268
It was total chaos.

00:54:09.351 --> 00:54:12.188
The camera was still rolling
when the director called cut,

00:54:12.271 --> 00:54:14.523
but they were at each other's throats.

00:54:14.607 --> 00:54:17.359
If word of this gets out,
we're in big trouble.

00:54:17.443 --> 00:54:19.528
We have to make sure
the crew keeps their lips sealed.

00:54:19.612 --> 00:54:21.739
But the bigger issue
is that neither of them

00:54:21.822 --> 00:54:24.658
is willing to apologize,
and they won't continue shooting.

00:54:24.742 --> 00:54:26.619
They won't listen to the director or me.

00:54:26.702 --> 00:54:29.622
No one can stop moms.
Bro, just get over here.

00:54:29.705 --> 00:54:30.998
We need you here now!

00:54:31.082 --> 00:54:32.041
Director Bak.

00:54:32.708 --> 00:54:34.835
How could you cast her
without discussing it with me?

00:54:34.919 --> 00:54:37.463
You're not the director!
Why would he need it discuss it with you?

00:54:37.546 --> 00:54:39.632
Then is Lim Hyeon-jun the director?

00:54:39.715 --> 00:54:41.884
He has no right
to pull strings for his mom like this!

00:54:41.967 --> 00:54:44.220
-What did you just say?
-It wasn't like that, ma'am.

00:54:44.303 --> 00:54:46.847
You heard that, right? Get over here now.

00:54:46.931 --> 00:54:48.099
All right.

00:54:48.182 --> 00:54:50.142
-How could you bring her on board?
-Are you done talking?

00:55:13.833 --> 00:55:15.167
-The coffee…
-Oh.

00:55:15.251 --> 00:55:16.460
I brought the coffee.

00:55:19.797 --> 00:55:21.715
I'm sorry. I had to take that call.

00:55:23.467 --> 00:55:24.677
Did something happen?

00:55:26.387 --> 00:55:27.721
No.

00:55:28.514 --> 00:55:33.269
Did you ask to meet today
because you had something to tell me?

00:55:33.352 --> 00:55:34.228
I wanted to say--

00:55:36.105 --> 00:55:37.898
-Mom!
-Are you okay? Hey!

00:55:38.774 --> 00:55:41.068
-Oh, no!
-Are you okay?

00:55:44.864 --> 00:55:46.448
Mom!

00:55:47.741 --> 00:55:50.911
-What happened?
-Mom!

00:55:50.995 --> 00:55:52.913
-Mom!
-Weren't you watching them?

00:55:53.789 --> 00:55:54.832
Mr. Lim?

00:55:55.624 --> 00:55:56.542
What's wrong?

00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.420
Are you okay? Mr. Lim!

00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:09.346
Let's get out of here.

00:56:25.696 --> 00:56:26.739
Are you okay?

00:56:29.909 --> 00:56:30.743
Yes.

00:56:35.956 --> 00:56:36.957
I'm sorry.

00:56:39.919 --> 00:56:41.003
There's no need to apologize.

00:57:24.129 --> 00:57:25.589
It's a sunny day today.

00:57:26.173 --> 00:57:27.049
My head…

00:57:29.593 --> 00:57:30.970
feels warm already.

00:57:31.053 --> 00:57:32.096
If you'd like,

00:57:32.596 --> 00:57:34.974
I can share a simple feel-good method.

00:57:35.057 --> 00:57:38.185
Go outside on a sunny day
and simply stand there.

00:57:38.269 --> 00:57:39.311
That's it?

00:57:39.395 --> 00:57:41.188
After standing for a while,

00:57:41.272 --> 00:57:43.607
your head will start to feel warm
from the sunshine.

00:57:44.233 --> 00:57:45.651
When that happens,

00:57:46.527 --> 00:57:48.654
it feels like someone
is gently stroking your head.

00:58:00.541 --> 00:58:03.168
Nobody does that for you anymore
once you become an adult.

00:58:03.752 --> 00:58:05.337
So I like to think

00:58:05.921 --> 00:58:09.216
that my parents are the ones
gently stroking my head.

00:58:11.593 --> 00:58:13.053
It makes me feel better.

00:58:44.752 --> 00:58:46.837
I tried your feel-good method today.

00:58:47.338 --> 00:58:50.257
I stood outside in the sun.

00:59:30.589 --> 00:59:33.384
What you said about
celebrity and non-celebrity couples

00:59:33.467 --> 00:59:34.593
always ending in disaster…

00:59:35.177 --> 00:59:36.303
Do you really believe that?

00:59:36.387 --> 00:59:38.764
Do I really have to teach you everything?

00:59:38.847 --> 00:59:40.265
You need to give her reassurance.

00:59:40.766 --> 00:59:42.643
There's someone I like.

00:59:43.685 --> 00:59:45.479
Just go on ten dates with me.

00:59:45.562 --> 00:59:46.814
If that goes well,
we'll keep seeing each other.

00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:50.317
-Listen, I--
-Just shut up!

00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:53.654
I like Wi Jeong-sin!

00:59:54.905 --> 00:59:57.449
She's totally into me.

01:00:02.287 --> 01:00:04.289
