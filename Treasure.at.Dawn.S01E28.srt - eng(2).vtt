If you want me to join you, you should be sincere.

If you come up to me and say that,

I might talk to you.

You'll die today.

Not only will you die,

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:09.440
He can't be trusted.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.480
Don't trust him.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.390
It doesn't matter.

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:13.240
Let him go.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:15.870
My Lord, thank you for trusting me.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.720
I'll go right now.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:24.000
Here's the Painting of Luan.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.060
If you can't find the entrance, you can look at it.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:30.110
I won't let you down.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:32.790
Let's go.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.200
My Lord.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.000
He has the Bird Jade Plate and the Painting of Luan.

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:42.480
Will he...?

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:43.680
I trust him.

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:46.160
I gave them to him

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.440
because he is ambitious.

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:49.590
He won't

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.160
be swayed by money.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.480
What he wants

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.790
is Xichuan.

00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:59.550
When I get the Treasure of the Sealed Book,

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.440
it doesn't matter

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:03.070
if I give Xichuan to him.

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:35.630
Wait.

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.920
Stop.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:39.110
You guys

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.110
walked here and there.

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:44.310
It's like you were walking the chickens.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.070
Are you kidding me?

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.680
If you hurt him,

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:51.870
I'll kill you

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:52.870
even if I'll die.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:54.000
Believe it or not.

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.790
Sun Siming, I remind you.

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:01.060
Fu Sheng is the only one who knows the location of the treasure.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.480
It doesn't matter

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.350
if we die.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.440
But your lord is a tough person.

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:08.450
If you can't get the job done,

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:09.280
you'll suffer.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:12.680
Put it away.

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:13.790
We don't have to do that.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.830
We're friends.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.240
Besides,

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:21.000
we are all in the same boat.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.590
If we can't find the Treasure of the Sealed Book,

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:25.590
we will all suffer.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:27.310
Without the Painting of Luan,

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.680
we can only try our luck.

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:31.110
If you're in a hurry,

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:33.000
leave with your men.

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:34.760
It's my bad.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.760
It's my bad.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:36.680
Come here.

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.720
And this.

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:55.870
You can use it to solve the puzzle.

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:01.640
You don't have to do that.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.400
Even if we have this,

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:04.920
we can't get away

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:06.200
with your people surrounded.

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.920
I'm not afraid of you running away.

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:10.550
I have to warn you.

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:12.070
You have to hurry.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.310
My Lord is not patient.

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.960
What is this?

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.900
It's just a hollowed-out bronze ball.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.550
There are no special marks.

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:30.480
How does this work?

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:32.870
I can't tell.

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:34.630
Let me try.

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:42.480
Fu Sheng.

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:45.870
Did your father leave you a message

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:46.590
or a spell?

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:47.480
No.

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:13.960
Look.

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:17.280
Look.

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:19.800
Is it fun?

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:20.870
Yes.

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:25.790
Look. It's different.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:26.590
Right?

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:27.240
Yes.

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.350
Take a look.

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:33.390
Does it look like that?

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:35.110
Yeah.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.960
Look at the shadow.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:44.110
Is it the same as this?

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:45.960
Is it fun?

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.030
Yeah.

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:47.830
Okay.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.870
Fu Sheng, if you like it,

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:52.480
I'll make it better, okay?

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:53.480
Okay.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:55.590
Father.

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:00.630
Father.

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:02.960
Father.

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:31.390
Father.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:45.590
The map of Xichuan.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:52.520
I see.

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.280
I know the secret of the Painting of Luan.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:58.310
I see.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.680
I got it.

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:12.310
Why are you talking to yourself?

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:17.000
I know where the treasure is.

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:20.030
Where is it?

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:21.520
The dragon head.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.870
The peak.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.480
The treasure is there.

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:30.310
Go.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.000
All right.

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:48.720
There is no road

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.070
ahead.

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:52.200
Here we are.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:53.350
Here?

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:55.960
Attention.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.110
Yes.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.720
If you can't find the entrance tonight,

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:01.720
every one of you

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.440
will die.

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:06.550
Split up.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:07.520
Yes.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:12.280
Let's look for it.

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:13.240
No need.

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:16.110
Leave it to them.

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:17.390
They're more anxious than we are.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.350
Let's go ahead.

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:21.760
We seldom have a chance to enjoy the scenery of the mountain.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:22.680
Okay.

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:24.680
Young Mistress.

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.790
Can you take me to enjoy the beautiful view?

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:28.000
It's up to you.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.240
I can't stop you if you want to come.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:35.520
Is it

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:36.390
beautiful?

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:38.550
Yes.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.240
Xichuan is too prosperous.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.200
It's too prosperous to stay.

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:46.480
I prefer Shangyi.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.100
We can't go back.

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:50.390
We have

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:51.760
to look forward.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.030
I like it.

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:56.160
I, Sun Siming,

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:57.790
never look back.

00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:00.110
People who think about old times are fools.

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:04.440
I am forced by the situation.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:05.720
Otherwise,

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.350
I might be able to make friends with Fu Sheng.

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:09.830
Stop it.

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:11.680
Fu Sheng and you are not of the same kind.

00:34:13.390 --> 00:34:14.350
Fu Sheng.

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:15.790
How do you know

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:17.310
this is the entrance to the treasure?

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:19.760
See where we are.

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:27.820
[The Map of Xichuan]

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:30.040
Look.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.670
[Xichuan]

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:34.280
This is the only dragon on this map.

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:36.950
I've heard a story

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:39.310
about the dragon.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.760
There is a dragon in the world.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.830
It has gold in its mouth, which helps you make money.

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:48.680
Its tail is wrapped in gold, which brings you unexpected fortune.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.120
After the dragon dies, it will fall into the mortal world.

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:55.120
Treasure will appear at its tail.

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:58.040
What does this have to do with the Treasure of the Sealed Book?

00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.430
If this legend

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:01.240
is true,

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:04.240
and Xichuan is where the dragon falls,

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:06.120
where do you think

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.200
the dragon's tail is?

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.470
The Star Gold mine.

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:17.390
The dragon's tail is wrapped in gold.

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:20.310
The gold is Xichuan's unique Star Gold.

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:22.040
It is an unexpected fortune.

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:23.560
That's right.

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.470
Now that we've found the dragon tail,

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.850
we can find the Treasure of the Sealed Book

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.680
by finding the dragon head.

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.470
The dragon head...

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:46.850
Is it there?

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:56.200
Father, why don't you rest in the tent

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:58.560
but sit in this deserted place?

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:02.040
Do you think Xichuan

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:04.910
is not as prosperous as Jibei?

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:08.790
Or are you blaming me

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:12.120
for not letting you bring your harem with you?

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.830
Father, you must be kidding.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.120
Father, you're powerful.

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:23.310
You didn't have to come to Xichuan

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.720
as you could conquer it with no soldiers.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.720
I would have stayed in Jibei.

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.600
When you return in triumph,

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:31.640
I can greet you

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:35.460
so that you don't get tired from your journey.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:41.640
Father...

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.040
Father.

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.430
Did I

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:47.760
say something wrong?

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.870
I'm regretting

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.640
that I chose you

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.470
as Jibei King.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.190
Father.

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:01.640
Father, spare my life.

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:03.080
Father, spare my life.

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:05.040
The Treasure of the Sealed Book

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.830
is about our lives.

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:10.160
We need to get it

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.350
to prevent future troubles.

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:13.390
Do you understand?

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:15.760
Yes.

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:17.350
Father, I understand.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:18.600
I understand.

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:40.960
I know you have a lot on your mind.

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:44.420
But you need to know

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.200
that I made you the Jibei King,

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:48.320
and

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.760
I can remove you.

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:55.020
You can only have what I give you.

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.160
If I don't give it to you,

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:00.350
you shouldn't think about it.

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:03.830
Father, I understand.

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:05.430
Of course.

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:19.510
Someone.

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:21.720
Get rid of these vines and weeds.

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:22.240
Yes.

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:26.470
Use your hands.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.790
What if you break the entrance with the swords?

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:29.430
Yes.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:37.910
Sir, we found it.

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.200
These are murals.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:55.600
Open this door,

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.870
and we can find the Treasure of the Sealed Book.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:39.510
We made it.

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:41.680
Come on. Light a beacon fire.

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:42.950
Inform the lord.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:49.790
You went in. You're rude.

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:50.910
Come on, give it to me.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.280
Stay put.

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:53.200
I'll go in and take a look.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:14.640
My Lord.

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:16.910
Sun Siming should have found the entrance.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:18.390
Assemble.

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:19.640
Let's go.

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:20.870
Yes.

00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:52.160
How can there be traces of someone's life?

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:54.340
Is someone living here?

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:58.120
It's been twenty years. No one can be alive.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.390
Let's check it out.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:23.830
Look.

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:29.470
The fire isn't out yet.

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.950
There's something cooking in the pot.

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:34.830
Is there really someone here?

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.130
Fu Sheng.

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:09.780
Gu Tian.

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:11.620
Wait for me.

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.580
Where are you?

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.950
Fu Sheng.

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:22.600
Gu Tian.

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:25.390
Where are you?

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:37.430
Let's find something to light.

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:39.720
Let's light the bonfire first.

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:48.560
Go help her.

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.210
I'm afraid of the dark.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:57.010
You're afraid of the dark and ghosts.

00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:58.240
What are you not afraid of?

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:11.510
Look.

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:13.610
There's an animal bone

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:15.430
and a rag with spices.

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:16.390
Is it okay?

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:17.990
Throw it in.

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.310
What's wrong? Can't we use it?

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:25.420
The spice on the cloth

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:27.200
is Que Xian. We can't burn it.

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:30.870
We saw it in Shangyi.

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:36.310
Who's there?

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:43.040
Go help him.

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:00.560
My Lord.

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:01.870
Chairman Sun entered the entrance.

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:02.990
He asked us to wait here for you.

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:04.910
Sun Siming is really unreliable.

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:10.430
Sishui.

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:12.240
Take a team

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.350
to find the Treasure of the Sealed Book with me.

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.990
Yes, My Lord.

00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:16.950
You.

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.040
Guard the route of retreat for me.

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:22.280
Father, don't worry.

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:25.560
There will be no trouble with me here.

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.080
Father, stay safe

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:29.160
and come back early.

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.120
Let's go.

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:55.170
Your Majesty,

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.570
congratulations on your marriage.

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:01.980
Mine is the poison.

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.570
Wen Jue!
