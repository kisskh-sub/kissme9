00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.970
Hello, everyone.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.680
I am the Technical Director

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.050
from Tongchen Technology, Li Wu.

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:50.140
(Tongchen AI Environmental)
Next, I will show you all in detail

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.350
(Protection System "CloudMap")
the specific value of our

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.066
Tongchen AI environmental
protection system

00:01:54.088 --> 00:01:55.100
and its significance.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.660
As everyone knows,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.088
large models have revolutionized

00:01:58.088 --> 00:01:59.533
the way humans interact with machines.

00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:00.070
Rest assured.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.280
We can use natural language

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.220
as input.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.970
However,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.870
large models also have many issues.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:05.380
For example,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.480
government

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.000
and enterprise core data

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.660
often contain high confidentiality,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.310
which means we usually cannot

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.130
directly input them for training.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.620
Another example,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.470
many large models

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.480
are highly closed systems,

00:02:17.488 --> 00:02:18.520
which makes it impossible

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.900
to update information in real time.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.870
Our Tongchen system

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.570
solves all of these problems.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.520
I summarize its core value

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.380
as...

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.780
Tailor-made solutions.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.280
Specifically,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.080
for different

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.150
data sources

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.560
and different analysis methods,

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.355
our system can create
a customized solution

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.030
for such data,

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.850
tailored precisely

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.680
to solve many

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.570
difficult data problems perfectly.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.500
Why are they discussing for so long?

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.130
How long until the result?

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.120
Don't worry.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.690
Almost done.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.690
Mr. Li.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.570
I heard you sold your car.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.660
Isn't it inconvenient to take a taxi

00:03:06.733 --> 00:03:07.940
coming all the way out here?

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.810
Not really.

00:03:09.044 --> 00:03:10.130
There's a direct subway.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.560
I am someone

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.666
who values relationships.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.710
I really can't bear

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.810
seeing you like this now.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.620
How about this?

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:18.560
Later,

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.900
let's not take the subway.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.530
You can take my car.

00:03:23.488 --> 00:03:24.780
You're actually pretty nice.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.340
Since you said so,

00:03:28.711 --> 00:03:30.130
I'll be a good guy to the end.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.500
But I'll tell you in advance.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.360
With your proposal,

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.360
you won't pass

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.380
the pricing section alone.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.530
Not to mention the other parts.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.660
Listen to my advice.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.060
Pack up early

00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:42.488
and look for another chance.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.560
Okay.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.180
Everyone,

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.410
the result is out.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:51.870
Please follow me

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.730
to the conference room

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.250
for the final announcement.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:58.250
Let's go.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:15.130
Alright.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.100
I hereby announce

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.780
the company that has won the bid

00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:21.600
(Guo Qiang)
is Tongchen Technology.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.120
Tongchen Technology's proposal

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.190
- with its irreplaceable
- What happened?

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.123
- technological advancement
- How would I know?

00:04:33.147 --> 00:04:34.360
- and energy-saving advantages
- How would I know?

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.660
has won this bid,

00:04:35.733 --> 00:04:37.244
highlighting the significance and value

00:04:37.266 --> 00:04:39.000
of intelligent environmental protection.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.870
Using AI to expand human cognition

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.370
across more fields,

00:04:42.422 --> 00:04:44.270
driving social development
through technology

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.600
to promote national progress.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:46.490
Finally,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.290
let us join hands

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.170
to protect our shared home,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.730
Earth, together.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:53.660
Thank you all.

00:05:07.466 --> 00:05:08.930
We're not the same kind of people.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.530
I won't be taking your ride.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.000
Pay attention

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.377
to the court summons recently.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.360
Why did you buy so many?

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.400
When did you buy them?

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.120
I prepared them long ago.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.790
I just never had the chance
to bring them.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.120
What?

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.900
Are you nervous?

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.970
Aren't you nervous?

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.730
I have a lot of confidence in you.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.480
Dad, Mom.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.310
You're here.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.190
Mr. Cen, let me do it.

00:06:01.666 --> 00:06:02.750
- Wu is here.
- Let me.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:03.169
Come down.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.640
- I'm coming down.
- Let Wu install it.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.700
Okay.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.950
This one.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:08.750
This.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.610
Okay.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.340
You're back.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.780
Yeah.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.680
Mom's "general amnesty for all".

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.100
How could I not rush back?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.120
Smells so good.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.490
What delicious food are you making?

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.220
Ask your dad.

00:06:32.622 --> 00:06:33.730
Your dad picked the dishes.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.600
They must all be

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.530
your favorites.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.460
Thanks, Dad.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:38.700
Wu.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.290
The light is installed?

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.510
Young people are quick.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:43.070
Look at me.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.290
Clumsy hands and feet.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.140
Then, from now on,
leave this kind of work to Li Wu.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.100
Sure. Absolutely.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.900
Forgot to buy drinks.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:53.610
I...

00:06:53.644 --> 00:06:54.955
I'll go downstairs and buy some.

00:06:54.955 --> 00:06:55.666
No need.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.530
Wu.

00:06:57.955 --> 00:06:59.270
Go to the supermarket with me.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.930
It's nearby.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.270
Are you slicing the cucumber

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.410
or cutting it into chunks?

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.660
Ignoring me?

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.260
Wu.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.820
I asked you out alone,

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.044
not for anything else,

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.160
just to express

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.020
my attitude.

00:07:19.155 --> 00:07:20.333
Mrs. Cen, please go ahead.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.050
Jin is my daughter.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.970
Of course, I know her well.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.800
Her personality is actually

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.430
a mix of

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.820
her father and me.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.510
Soft-hearted,

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:30.340
but tough-mouthed.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.100
As for me,

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.610
I care a lot about face.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.190
My temper

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.260
isn't good either.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.800
So, Jin

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.170
should find someone

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.820
who is...

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.120
You know,

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:45.700
someone

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.100
who can handle her temper,

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.430
truly tolerate her,

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.610
and love her sincerely.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.390
Feelings are really

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.370
hard to explain clearly.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.930
Because you're still young.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:01.950
You can go through

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.340
all kinds of changes.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:04.700
But she can't.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.490
So...

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.480
I want you to know

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.730
what I worry about.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.410
Mrs. Cen,

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.490
I understand.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.100
As a mother,

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.070
of course, I want my daughter

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:17.950
to find someone

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.930
who always puts her first.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:22.820
But, that's just

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:23.970
too idealistic.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:25.490
Not very realistic.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:27.930
No one can really do that.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.780
I read your letter.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.770
I could feel your sincerity.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.890
For Jin's sake,

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.320
I'm willing to believe

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.890
that you can bring her happiness.

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:42.790
But Wu,
you must understand this clearly.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.240
I will never allow my daughter

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.670
to suffer a second harm.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:46.460
Do you understand?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.466
Mrs. Cen, please rest assured.

00:08:48.488 --> 00:08:50.533
I will definitely shield her
from the wind and rain

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.060
and be her support.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.720
Look at how nervous you are.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.370
Here, wipe it.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:08:59.940
From now on, you two come back

00:09:00.022 --> 00:09:01.733
for a meal on weekends when you're free.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:04.300
Okay.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.820
Let's buy some drinks.

00:09:10.777 --> 00:09:12.840
Dad. I didn't expect
that softening her attitude

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.610
would actually work.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.970
Mom actually agreed.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.000
But about this matter,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.460
I really can't take the credit.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.820
I did

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.300
do some persuasion work,

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.180
but mainly

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.790
it was Wu.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.220
That kid really put in effort.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.360
He expressed himself

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.700
to such an extent in the letter.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.720
How could your mother

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.111
stay angry after reading it?

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.940
A letter?

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.220
What letter?

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:38.540
You don't know?

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.180
I don't know.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.030
Wu wrote a letter to your mother.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.700
It was written very sincerely.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.600
After your mother read it,

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.610
there's no way she wasn't moved.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.180
I thought you taught him to write it.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.220
Dad, where is the letter?

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.790
In our bedside drawer.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:58.540
Go take a look.

(Hello.)

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:58.540
(I am Li Wu.)

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.360
(I'm sorry to communicate with you)

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.970
(in such a way.)

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.580
(Because I know)

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.670
(Mrs. Cen and you definitely)

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.377
(cannot accept this matter right away.)

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.420
(Cannot accept someone like me.)

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.820
(I've never been good with words.)

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.010
(After much thought,)

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:20.360
(I decided to express)

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.288
(everything I want to say
through a letter.)

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.120
(When I was five,)

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.340
(my parents passed away.)

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.300
(Later, my grandfather also died.)

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.940
(Originally, like many orphans,)

00:11:31.088 --> 00:11:33.755
(I once thought I had already seen
how my life would end.)

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:35.890
(Thanks to you,)

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.540
(I became who I am today.)

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:41.060
(Your kindness)

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.650
(is something I can never repay.)

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.650
(I can only first say to you,)

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:47.730
(thank you.)

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.240
(Falling for Cen Jin)

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.100
(was accidental.)

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:56.540
(But also inevitable.)

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.390
(Because she is)

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.133
(the most wonderful person
in the world.)

00:12:00.155 --> 00:12:01.960
(She is kind, upright,)

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.540
(excellent, and beautiful.)

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:06.490
(She dragged me out of the mud)

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.180
(and gave me a new life.)

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.890
(After coming to Yi City,)

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.850
(she has always looked after me,)

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.130
(cared for me,)

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:15.370
(protected me)

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.300
(and guided me.)

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.460
(Prevented me from making any mistakes,)

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.820
(encouraged me and taught me
to focus on studying.)

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.770
(The meaning she brings me)

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:25.910
(is far beyond)

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.340
(simple romantic feelings.)

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:28.850
(You could say)

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.220
(she is a guiding light.)

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.580
(After meeting her,)

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:36.250
(my life has left the darkness.)

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:41.100
(In the years we were apart,)

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.580
(I thought of her every moment,)

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.120
(and became more certain
of my feelings,)

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.870
(and decided that I would forever)

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.420
(protect this light.)

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.770
(So)

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.970
(I want to show you my sincerity)

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.180
(within my current ability.)

00:12:58.630 --> 00:12:59.540
(I know)

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.510
(what I can give her)

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.060
(may seem insignificant to you,)

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.130
(but)

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.850
(apart from unwavering love,)

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.700
(up to this moment,)

00:13:11.444 --> 00:13:12.480
(this is everything)

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.100
(I can do for Cen Jin.)

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:21.220
(From Li Wu)

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.390
Anyway,

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.060
Xinshang is very satisfied with you.

00:13:43.444 --> 00:13:45.960
Their internal procedures
are notoriously slow in the industry.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.390
For things to move so fast this time,

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:48.420
even I'm surprised.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.850
It's all thanks to your help.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.080
Otherwise, how could this matter

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.250
go so smoothly this time?

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.370
Look at you.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.770
Mr. Li is still so modest.

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:00.510
But seriously,

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.180
investors only look at value,

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.390
which means your value

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:04.250
has been recognized.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.300
I'm happy for you.

00:14:09.911 --> 00:14:11.790
Alright. I still have a meeting
at the company.

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:12.650
I'll get going first.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.060
Leaving so soon?

00:14:14.311 --> 00:14:15.150
I'll walk you out.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:15.480
Okay.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:15.960
Slow down.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:16.360
Okay.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.266
You get back to work.

It's so late.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.480
Didn't you say you still had work

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.370
to deal with?

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.360
Hurry back.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.555
Finish up and sleep early.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.130
What are you doing? Hurry.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:55.970
Come on.

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:57.060
Hurry.

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:00.850
Finish up and sleep early, okay?

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:02.060
See you tomorrow.

(Li Wu)
(Time Imprint Diamond Ring)

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:39.940
Forgot something?

00:15:40.311 --> 00:15:41.270
I left my clothes here.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.130
Came back to get them.

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:44.630
You could've come back tomorrow.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:45.460
Isn't that the same?

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:47.000
Yeah.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.510
But since I'm already here,

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:49.733
I'll just take them today.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:55.940
Go to sleep.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.420
Good night.

00:16:15.022 --> 00:16:15.822
Sorry.

00:16:15.822 --> 00:16:17.840
I accidentally broke it.
Let me help you pick it up.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.320
It's fine.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:18.940
Here.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.150
I'm really sorry.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:21.250
I was in too much of a rush.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.540
I'll get going then.

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:26.180
You...

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.580
What did you buy?

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:29.580
It's such a big box.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.730
Nothing.

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:34.730
Just some daily necessities.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.300
Are you going to work?

00:16:38.377 --> 00:16:39.370
I can give you a ride.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:40.850
It's fine.

00:16:41.044 --> 00:16:42.480
I have something else to do today,

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.688
so I won't go to the office.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:45.420
Take care on the way.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.420
I'll head to work then.

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.650
Bye.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:06.890
Are you going up or downstairs?

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.610
Downstairs.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:22.740
(Only to Lock You In)

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.740
Wait a moment.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.510
I think

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:30.720
the slogan about marriage

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.020
isn't positioned accurately enough.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:33.750
Since our core concept

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:34.680
is not about romance,

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.550
there's no need to reveal too much

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:37.890
about the attitude toward marriage.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.160
This will both distract

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.240
the audience's attention

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.850
and make the audience feel

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.100
that we're lecturing them.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:45.980
I think so, too.

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:48.200
Because if it were my friend

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.466
who was about to get married,

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:51.440
and she saw this sentence,

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.070
it might make her feel

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:53.930
a bit rebellious.

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:57.030
Is this "friend" of yours

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:57.890
actually you?

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:00.750
Anyway, I think

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.000
marriage is just whatever.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:02.960
But I don't want

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.070
to be educated by an ad,

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:06.590
unless it truly agrees with me

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:07.480
and understands me.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.300
Only then would I willingly pay for it.

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:13.340
Speaking of this, I have a say.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.610
Because I've been thinking lately...

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.270
My boyfriend and I

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:18.690
have been together six years.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:20.980
Next, either we get married

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.690
or we'll have to break up.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:25.830
Off-topic.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.750
We're talking about attitudes,

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.450
not actually about marriage.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.300
Sorry.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.610
Jin.

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:33.610
What do you think?

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.450
About attitudes toward marriage?

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:37.850
I don't have much to say.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:42.440
Why is he suddenly

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.780
going to propose?

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:46.030
We've only been dating again

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:47.450
for a short while.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.340
He never discussed it with me,

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.370
and never even tested my attitude.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.540
Why would he propose now?

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:55.300
Are you sure?

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:56.820
I'm sure.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.790
I found the receipt

00:18:58.790 --> 00:18:59.720
for the ring he bought.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.440
And a bunch of

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.820
wedding decoration receipts.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:05.170
Those things like

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.640
balloons, flowers,

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.980
and standing signs.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.780
Is it really something to worry
so much about?

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:17.170
Even taking a huge step back,

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:20.450
you're not against marriage.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.650
Being proposed to by someone you love

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.020
is always happy, right?

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:26.540
Happy is happy,

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:28.070
but how to handle it

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:29.410
is another matter.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.500
So are you happy?

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.300
I'm happy.

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:37.130
But you know,

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.930
I've been married and divorced.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.980
But Li Wu isn't like that.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.780
He should...

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:46.680
Anyway, I'm satisfied

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.750
with our relationship

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:48.450
right now.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.270
I don't want

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:50.540
to move forward so fast.

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:55.210
Shen and I

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.780
aren't planning
to take the next step either.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.890
But I think

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.300
we shouldn't limit ourselves.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.550
After all, the most important thing

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:07.500
isn't marriage,

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.650
but the person.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.060
Right?

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:23.780
You two are here too?

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:28.130
How did you come down from the terrace?

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.340
Well...

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.510
It's nighttime.

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:32.980
It's pretty comfortable up there.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.750
Oh, what a coincidence.

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:36.100
Cen Jin, Chun Chang.

00:20:36.688 --> 00:20:38.340
Didn't we still have work to discuss?

00:20:38.355 --> 00:20:38.720
Right.

00:20:38.755 --> 00:20:39.749
We'll go downstairs first.

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:40.550
Why didn't you

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:41.650
finish talking upstairs?

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.610
The wind is a bit cold up there.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.130
Yeah.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.070
We're going.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:51.822
I'm leaving first.

00:20:51.844 --> 00:20:52.511
Let's go.

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:00.820
You're right.

00:21:01.088 --> 00:21:03.210
There's definitely something
off about Li Wu.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.170
My upstairs terrace

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.100
was just renovated.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:09.580
The first ceremony

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.920
is my best friend's

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.060
suspected proposal ceremony.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.130
Guess my effort wasn't wasted.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.820
Get yourself ready.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:34.100
What's wrong?

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.310
Why so quiet?

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:36.260
Something on your mind?

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.400
No.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.020
I was thinking about work.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.590
I didn't get the chance to ask you.

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:43.890
I was so busy these two days.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.480
Is your jewelry project

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.580
going well?

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:52.980
I can interview you a bit

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:54.650
to collect some viewpoints.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.880
I told you before

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.580
that our main focus is rings.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.100
Our team talked about

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.930
views on marriage.

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:06.110
We found that everyone's view

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:07.500
seems a bit different.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.070
So I wanted to ask

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:09.930
what you think.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:12.340
See if you can inspire me.

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:15.890
My thoughts?

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.060
This...

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.780
Will it help?

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:22.060
Of course.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.680
Inspiration hides inside

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.210
small details of life.

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:29.500
You can

00:22:29.777 --> 00:22:30.610
just say anything.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:31.850
We're just chatting.

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.500
Even fragments are fine.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:35.890
No need to go deep.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:38.510
Of course, I long for marriage.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:39.130
Because

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:41.510
building a family

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:42.580
with the one you love

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.100
is the happiest thing.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:46.890
So you think marriage is important.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.270
Marriage is important

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:58.890
and sacred.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:01.170
To me, it's like...

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.880
A lighthouse

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:05.780
I want to reach.

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:10.720
I'm not saying it well.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.370
But...

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.550
Anyway, to me,

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:13.690
it's extremely important.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.790
Did I say

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:22.890
something wrong?

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.580
I just think

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.100
love and marriage

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.400
shouldn't be

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.060
the lighthouse of your life.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.780
But actually I just...

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.270
I know saying this

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:46.780
sounds preachy,

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.350
but as I said before

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:51.340
to you,

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:53.830
I hope you can first

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:55.500
completely belong to yourself.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.780
Put yourself first.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.850
Once you can do that,

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.820
then consider marriage.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.300
Do you...

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:06.540
Do you understand?

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:09.540
I understand.

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:15.980
So do you have any thoughts?

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.060
I think...

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:22.890
You're right.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.370
Then, it's settled.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.610
Okay, no problem.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.020
Sorry.

00:25:19.466 --> 00:25:21.000
Seems like their company made this.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:21.650
Thanks.

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:23.450
It's her.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:28.680
Morning, Jin.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:29.260
Morning.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:32.070
Morning, Jin.

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.510
Morning.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:33.066
Morning, Jin.

00:25:33.088 --> 00:25:33.610
Morning.

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:36.310
Jin.

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:37.070
Our video

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:38.480
has only been up 24 hours,

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.859
but its trending score has already,

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.150
exceeded expectations by double.

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:44.550
And the discussion
under the video is huge.

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.160
Lots of users started making memes,

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.030
and doing remixes.

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:48.030
They edited it together

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:49.270
with a trending joke recently.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:49.750
Super funny.

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:50.160
Really?

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.070
- I'll send it to you.
- Okay.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:52.710
I expected there would be discussion,

00:25:52.711 --> 00:25:54.400
but I didn't expect it
to blow up this much.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.300
Playing with memes really
is the strongest move.

00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:59.510
I just got a call from the client.

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:00.790
They're very satisfied.

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:03.210
They've decided to increase
the ad placement.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.070
Ms. Cen,

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:07.240
it really has to be you.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.000
This project

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.240
is done absolutely perfectly.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.020
It's all thanks to everyone's effort.

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:13.640
Already starting

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.650
to give your award speech?

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:15.890
Don't rush.

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:18.890
The Longxi Award submissions
start today.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:19.750
I'm planning

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:21.680
to submit this ad for it.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.444
How about that?

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.020
Sure.

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:24.830
So tonight,

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:25.640
I want to organize

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.590
a celebration dinner.

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:27.260
How's that?

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.270
- Good.
- Good!

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:28.930
Okay.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.030
Okay.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:30.790
Jun.

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:32.070
How about next weekend?

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:33.340
I have plans tonight.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:34.830
That works, too.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:35.780
Then, next weekend.

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:37.130
Okay.

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:38.650
Alright, back to work.

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:40.780
I know a really great restaurant.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.580
Going on another date?

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.960
I finally finished work,

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.555
so I made plans to meet a few friends.

00:26:47.577 --> 00:26:50.540
You always prioritize romance
over friendship.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:51.500
Jun.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.022
Where is everyone?

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.210
Why is no one here?

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.170
Not a single person.

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:11.160
No idea.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.020
What's going on?

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:13.300
Paopao.

00:27:13.533 --> 00:27:14.750
Did my bar go out of business?

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:15.830
Why didn't anyone tell me?

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:17.130
It didn't shut down.

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:18.666
Someone booked out the place.

00:27:20.177 --> 00:27:21.340
You could've said earlier.

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:22.400
Who booked it?

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.210
For what?

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.020
No clue.

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:26.030
Probably a company event

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:27.130
or a proposal or something.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:28.170
Then,

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.260
we...

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.720
The rooftop.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.711
No one's on the rooftop.

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:34.070
Alright then.

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:35.370
When Li Wu and Shen Yiyang arrive,

00:27:35.377 --> 00:27:36.020
let them know.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:40.370
I just finished work,

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:41.790
and rushed over here.

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:42.790
I'm not late, right?

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:44.000
We're just grabbing dinner.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.210
Being late doesn't matter.

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.930
Go on up.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.300
I'm going up then.

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.980
You're here.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.100
This is...

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:14.110
Li Wu, don't talk yet.

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:15.100
Listen to me first.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.370
Didn't I say the other day,

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:18.510
I hope you can

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:20.340
belong completely to yourself first.

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:21.850
Put yourself first.

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:23.440
When you manage that,

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.850
then think about marriage.

00:28:24.911 --> 00:28:25.822
Didn't you promise me?

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:27.110
Yes, I already promised you.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.510
But...

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:28.160
Of course,

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.350
even if you manage that,

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:30.680
I think we still don't need

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.410
to rush things.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.210
I know that I don't need
to doubt our love.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.680
And I know you're different

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.580
from everyone else.

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:38.070
If it's marrying you,

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:39.977
I'd be willing to think about it,
to imagine it.

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:41.400
But not now. Do you understand?

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.070
I understand.

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.780
But this...

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:43.920
Right now,

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.733
I feel like you don't understand at all.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.610
I'm not ready yet.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:49.830
I feel that at this stage,

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:50.930
this is the best stage.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:51.880
The best time.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:52.550
I don't want

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:54.177
to move to the next stage so quickly.

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:56.070
We'll talk about

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:57.200
other things later, okay?

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.210
Okay.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.270
We'll talk later.

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:00.070
But today,

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.933
let's free up the time

00:29:00.933 --> 00:29:03.000
and leave the space
for today's main characters.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:03.550
Okay?

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:04.300
Come on.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.930
You go ahead.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.300
What are you doing?

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:47.850
Chun Chang.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.340
Actually,

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:53.780
I've always wanted
to say one thing to you.

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:55.540
Thank you.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.100
Thank you for being so quirky
and unpredictable.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.550
Breaking into

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:01.890
my world with no rules at all.

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:04.880
You said it took a long time

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:05.850
to pursue me.

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:08.100
But actually,

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.540
I spent even more time

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.300
avoiding one fact.

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:14.070
That is,

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:15.580
from the first time I met you,

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.210
I was already attracted to you.

00:30:23.822 --> 00:30:25.260
I also hesitated for a long time,

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:26.500
wondering whether

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.580
I should propose to you this way.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:31.100
I feared the timing wasn't right,

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:32.740
and that you might feel pressured.

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:35.820
Recently, your mom came.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:36.640
I know

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.060
it put a lot of pressure on you.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.340
I also know

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.890
that regarding marriage,

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:42.980
you have many concerns and fears.

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:47.260
But I want to show you my trump card.

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:49.300
I want you to feel more confident.

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:51.300
If anyone

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.410
pressures you to marry,

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:55.450
you can tell them

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:57.930
you have a choice.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.580
As I said before,

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:17.590
if you're ready,

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:19.210
we can get married anytime.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:22.780
If you haven't made up your mind yet,

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.500
there's no rush.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.830
Whether marriage

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:28.210
is truly

00:31:28.244 --> 00:31:29.500
the destination of our love,

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.890
we can witness it together.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:35.610
However...

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.070
Today,

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:38.350
I didn't even dress up properly.

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:40.410
I didn't wear a new dress.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.740
But you look quite handsome.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.130
Why didn't you remind me?

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.650
Who proposes like this?

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:54.100
You literally

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:56.100
pulled a fast one on me.

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:57.410
Diversion tactics,

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.930
and you even had Li Wu
set a smoke screen.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.450
So may I ask,

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.110
this lady

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:07.820
without a new dress on,

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:09.920
would you marry

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.130
this slightly cunning man?

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.500
I do.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:17.130
Hurry, put it on me.

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:28.740
A hundred years of happiness!

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:34.780
So during this time,

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:37.020
you've been helping Shen Yiyang

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.610
prepare the proposal?

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:40.650
What?

00:32:40.933 --> 00:32:41.830
Just now, did you...

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:42.500
Shut up.

00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:58.540
So happy.

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:00.170
Of course.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:02.450
My best friend got proposed to.

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:04.370
So touching.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.000
When you rejected me earlier,

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.300
you didn't say that.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.160
Sorry.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.930
I got a little impatient just now.

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:16.830
I thought...

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:17.733
Are you disappointed?

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:20.920
Anyone would

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.060
react that way.

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:24.200
This isn't disappointment.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.170
It's a normal reaction.

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.500
A normal reaction?

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:30.830
Then I'll have to observe

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:31.930
your gaze carefully.

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:33.740
I want to see if you're lying.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.650
Your eyes flickered a bit.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.680
Alright.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.500
I won't tease you anymore. No jokes.

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:51.980
I understand

00:33:52.222 --> 00:33:53.370
everything you just said.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.820
I'm also willing

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:58.030
to imagine with you,

00:33:58.030 --> 00:33:59.890
to think about our future together.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.500
That's better.

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:05.500
In a couple of days,

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:06.680
are you free

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.355
to come with me back to Yunfeng Village?

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:10.210
Back to Yunfeng? For what?

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:13.280
A while ago, my aunt

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.330
asked me to come back.

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:16.290
But I've been

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:18.400
pretty busy, and couldn't make it.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.360
So I thought,

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.580
now that I'm free,

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.020
you could come with me.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.730
We'll see how you do.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.290
I'll definitely behave well.

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:45.900
(Shengzhou)

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:00.550
Ms. Cen.

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:01.290
Li Wu.

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:03.500
Ms. Cheng.

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:06.020
It's time to call her
Village Chief Cheng.

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:08.540
Village Chief Cheng?

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.360
I didn't recognize your greatness.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.730
Don't say that.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:15.000
It's my honor to witness Yunfeng Village

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.210
becoming better and better.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.420
I just thought I'd contact you again
when I get to the office.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:20.960
The certificate is ready.

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:21.900
Do you want it now?

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:23.060
What certificate?

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:25.100
Alright.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:26.580
Not for me.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:27.690
It's for her.

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:31.730
Here.

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:47.580
(Donation Certificate)

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:49.840
Li Wu donated, in your name,

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:50.880
a reading room

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.900
to Yunfeng Village.

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.900
It was just built.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.710
When did this start?

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:58.900
How come I didn't know?

00:36:00.733 --> 00:36:02.577
Probably when I just returned
to the country.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.150
I've been busy lately.

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:06.460
I almost forgot myself.

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:11.060
When you first returned,

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:13.420
you had already...

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.330
Take me to see it.

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:34.250
Sure.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.100
That's why I brought you.

00:36:36.733 --> 00:36:38.022
Let's leave it in the car first.

00:36:38.488 --> 00:36:40.280
You go ahead.
I have something else to do.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.200
- Okay. Thanks, Village Chief Cheng.
- Bye-bye.

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.140
(Wuxin Reading Academy)

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.020
Come in.

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:21.500
(Wuxin Reading Academy)

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:24.130
Wu is back.

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:30.440
So why is it called

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.380
Wuxin Reading Academy?

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.460
Because this is

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:36.810
the motto of Yunfeng Primary School.

00:37:38.088 --> 00:37:39.711
Passed down from the older generation.

00:37:39.733 --> 00:37:40.650
It's been a long time.

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:42.210
So I thought

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.860
I'd preserve all these words.

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:45.650
It's quite meaningful.

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:49.540
Hua.

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:52.630
Hello, Wu.

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:53.800
Hello.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.230
Hello, Sister.

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:56.170
Hello.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.940
Continue to read.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.420
Hello, Sister.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.400
Hello, Sister.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.720
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello, Sister.

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.540
- Hello, Wu.
- Hello, Wu.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:05.590
Hello, everyone.

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:06.330
So well-behaved.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:17.150
This reading room was also

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:18.580
built specifically for children.

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.060
But...

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:22.690
my current ability is limited.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.550
Still, I want to do as much as possible

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:27.200
to provide some help for the children.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.980
I hope they can read more books

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.440
and grow up through the knowledge

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.900
in the books.

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:35.380
However,

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.020
no matter how far they go,

00:38:40.111 --> 00:38:41.320
I hope that in the future,

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.555
they won't forget this place.

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:57.460
This is me?

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.250

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.060
