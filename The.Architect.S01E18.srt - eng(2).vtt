00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.760

you've called me stupid,

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:45.719
how to protect

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.039

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.439

Xiao Huaijin, listen carefully.

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.040
You will have your father
write a full confession,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.680
explaining how he plotted to destroy

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.120
