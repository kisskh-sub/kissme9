00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.240
How is it?

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.720
Nothing.

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:15.190
Have you found him?

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.720
No.

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:20.800
We're really water bandits now.

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:34.600
Stop your foolish trick!

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:35.119
You!

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:36.000
Who are you?

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.280
I'm the Goddess of River you
worship in all four seasons.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.479
Goddess of River?

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.799
The Canal Guild has prayed to the Goddess
of River for nearly a hundred years.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.039
We've never once seen her true form.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.520
If you claim to be the goddess,
can you prove it?

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:50.439
Right.

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.990
Pretending to be a deity
will get you struck by lightning.

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:54.880
Ignorant.

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:56.119
Slap him.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.719
She really is the Goddess of River.

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:07.359
I spoke out of turn.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.560
Please forgive me, Goddess!

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.439
If not for your devotion,

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.599
I wouldn't have appeared to warn you.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:14.280
You're a deity,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.799
but...

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.760
Your real name is Zhao Er.

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:18.840
You were born to a hunter's family.

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:22.239
At seventeen, you were sold
to the Shen family as a guard.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.040
The master

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.640
saw your loyalty and courage,

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:27.480
so he lent you silver

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.159
to help you form the Canal Guild.

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:32.359
Goddess, you needn't say more.

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:33.000
I believe you.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.840
I believe you!

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.450
- Long live the Goddess of River!
- Long live the Goddess of River!

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.560
Please bless the Canal
with smooth sailing!

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.190
Since you've appeared,

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.710
do you have any instructions for us?

00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:46.359
I give you only one warning.

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:48.480
If you meet Pei Yu again,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.159
do not oppose him.

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:51.439
Otherwise,

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.120
disaster will befall upon you.

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:56.519
Pei Yu?

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.439
I know your concern.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.600
You're afraid the imperial court
will drain you of all you have.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.640
Pei Yu is nothing like the rumors.

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.280
He will treat you fairly.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.319
We humbly obey your decree!

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.080
- We humbly obey your decree!

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.730
You added hallucinogenic powder
from Western Region into their drinks

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:19.719
and took back
the Canal Guild effortlessly.

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:21.400
Truly impressive.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.400
Once the Xiao family surrenders,

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.290
they'll have to pay blood for blood
and give the Shen family justice.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.039
After that,

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:33.759
do you have any other wishes?

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.479

You got someone
to impersonate Xiao Huaijin

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:41.360
to lure me here.

00:06:42.487 --> 00:06:43.480
So what if I did?

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.680
Did you really think

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:47.240
you could find the evidence

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.000
of him escaping the prison?

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:53.079
The Prince Duan's Residence
is corrupt and treacherous.

00:06:53.262 --> 00:06:54.240
The evidence is solid.

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:55.759
Right now,

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:57.160
he's waiting to be executed.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.600
A lowborn concubine like you

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:03.879
thinks you can topple
Prince Duan's Residence?

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.720
Keep dreaming.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.560
Vixen really has no brain.

00:07:09.875 --> 00:07:12.079
You claim Prince Duan smuggled iron ore?

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.959
I can say he was following
His Majesty's secret orders

00:07:16.575 --> 00:07:18.360
to store silver for the treasury.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.600
He killed the entire Shen family.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.800
How do you explain
dozens of innocent lives?

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:28.319
Who saw it?

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:30.560
What proof do you have?

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:32.199
Who would dare accuse Prince Duan?

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:38.120
You're powerless

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.600
and being ridiculous.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.600
At worst,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.120
Prince Duan and his son will be exiled.

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:44.920
A few years later,

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:47.000
His Majesty will call him back.

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:49.000
But taking your life

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:51.839
is easier than pinching an ant.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.959
I'd like to see

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.120
who can save you today.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.600
Go.

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:05.160
Kill her.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:11.759
Yu,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.480
don't you like

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.919
watching women dance?

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.000
I practiced this dance so hard

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.679
that my feet swelled.

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:20.919
Why don't you like it?

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.960
What did you do to Xi Yan?

00:09:26.159 --> 00:09:26.840
She's dead.

00:09:28.759 --> 00:09:29.919
If she were dead,

00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:32.440
you wouldn't be scheming this much.

00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:45.360
Remember.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.600
If anything happens to her,
you'll be buried with her.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.240
I'll be buried with her?

00:09:55.759 --> 00:09:57.240
Did you forget, Yu?

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.879
When I was little,
my father was murdered.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.039
The enemy wanted me dead too.

00:10:07.679 --> 00:10:10.000
You were the one who saved me.

00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:15.480
Why?

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.679
Why can't you protect me

00:10:18.679 --> 00:10:20.799
as you did back then?

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.279
I'm warning you.

00:10:30.039 --> 00:10:32.080
If you lay a finger on Xi Yan again,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.240
hurt her even a little,

00:10:35.159 --> 00:10:36.679
and I'll take it back tenfold.

00:10:38.919 --> 00:10:40.000
Understand?

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.600
Yu!

00:11:05.799 --> 00:11:06.360
Your Highness.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.200
Your Highness,

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.720
what happened?

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.639
Your Highness.

00:11:10.759 --> 00:11:14.159
He wants to kill me for her.

00:11:16.639 --> 00:11:17.639
He doesn't care

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:22.320
about me at all.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:25.879
Your Highness.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.399
Just why?

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.120
You have fifteen minutes.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.639
Don't worry, Father.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.559
I've arranged everything.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.200
Those ministers at court

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.679
will all speak for us

00:11:48.799 --> 00:11:50.200
in front of His Majesty.

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:53.840
I'm the non-imperial prince
appointed by the late Emperor.

00:11:54.679 --> 00:11:56.200
I've rendered

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.399
countless merits.

00:11:57.399 --> 00:11:59.039
His Majesty won't punish me.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.879
You don't need to fawn over anyone.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.759
I was only reminded of

00:12:02.759 --> 00:12:04.159
General Li.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.080
They said

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.360
he had too many achievements,

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.080
that's why...

00:12:12.879 --> 00:12:14.120
But it's nothing serious.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:14.679
In the end,

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:16.960
we can find a scapegoat.

00:12:19.399 --> 00:12:20.879
A scapegoat, is it?

00:12:23.559 --> 00:12:25.759
The Prince Duan's Residence
smuggled imperial iron ore.

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:26.840
The evidence is conclusive.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.879
I wonder what gives you the confidence

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.500
that you think
you can escape punishment?

00:12:31.159 --> 00:12:31.840
Lowly maid.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.279
You think a mere iron ore

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.080
can bring me down?

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.399
Once I'm out,
you'll be the first I get rid of.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:40.240
You don't care about
the iron mines case.

00:12:40.679 --> 00:12:42.090
Then what about framing Shen Wenyuan

00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:44.600
and murdering the Shen family in prison?

00:12:44.919 --> 00:12:45.440
You!

00:12:46.279 --> 00:12:47.360
You're spouting nonsense!

00:12:48.039 --> 00:12:49.399
You think killing them all

00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:50.840
can hide your crime?

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.200
Not everyone can sleep soundly

00:12:54.879 --> 00:12:57.200
after taking lives like you do.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.360
Your accomplices and those who helped you

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.919
have all confessed.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.120
You brat,

00:13:09.399 --> 00:13:10.440
what have you done?

00:13:12.879 --> 00:13:13.399
Impossible.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.639
This is impossible!

00:13:16.559 --> 00:13:18.440
The way you framed the Shen family

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.840
and killed them,

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:22.879
every detail is written clearly
in this testimony.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.000
If I present it to His Majesty,

00:13:26.679 --> 00:13:27.519
you know very well

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.480
what will happen.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.960
So what if you hand it over?

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.660
I'm the prince personally granted my title
by the late Emperor.

00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:39.879
If we confront each other
before His Majesty,

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.840
who knows how it will end?

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.039
True.

00:13:44.879 --> 00:13:45.879
But what if

00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:47.720
you're no longer able to speak?

00:13:53.039 --> 00:13:53.840
Xiao Huaijin,

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.440
Prince Duan is guilty beyond redemption.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.159
Are you willing to

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.480
let the entire Prince Duan's Residence
go down with him?

00:14:05.175 --> 00:14:07.100
(End of Episode)

00:14:07.559 --> 00:14:08.679
In His Majesty's eyes,

00:14:08.962 --> 00:14:11.600
the Prince Duan's Residence
has always been this.

00:14:14.919 --> 00:14:17.600
(Xiao Huaijin shall inherit the title)

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.759
(and be promoted to
Left Vice Minister of Revenue.)

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.200
(That's all.)

00:14:22.919 --> 00:14:25.799
(I thank Your Majesty
for your boundless grace.)

00:14:25.799 --> 00:14:28.720
(Do status and power
give you the right to take innocent lives?)

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.399
(I will not accept that!)

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.930
(If it comes to it,
I'll drag you down with me!)
