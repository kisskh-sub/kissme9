HEROES NEXT DOOR

00:00:42.147 --> 00:00:43.065
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PROFESSIONS, PLACES,

00:00:43.148 --> 00:00:44.066
COMPANIES, ORGANIZATIONS,
ETHNIC GROUPS AND EVENTS ARE NOT REAL.

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:45.067
ALL CHILD AND ANIMAL SCENES WERE FILMED
SAFELY UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.030
WELCOME TO CHANGRI-DONG

00:00:54.076 --> 00:00:56.578
So this is like an EMP device?

00:00:56.662 --> 00:00:57.621
Exactly.

00:00:57.704 --> 00:01:00.248
So when I turn this on,

00:01:00.332 --> 00:01:01.792
pull the lever,

00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:03.293
and press the button,

00:01:03.377 --> 00:01:04.920
it'll cause a blackout.

00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:07.881
All electronics nearby will be turned off.

00:01:08.423 --> 00:01:10.717
- All phones and computers, too?
- Of course.

00:01:11.218 --> 00:01:13.261
But how do you know that it really works?

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.264
Well,

00:01:16.932 --> 00:01:19.851
you know the recent blackout?

00:01:19.935 --> 00:01:21.395
- You're kidding.
- No way.

00:01:21.478 --> 00:01:23.438
Why, you...

00:01:23.772 --> 00:01:26.566
That blackout turned off
all the fridges at my store!

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.486
- All the meat and ice cream...
- Sorry, calm down.

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.113
- Seriously...
- Calm down, okay?

00:01:31.196 --> 00:01:32.989
I'm just saying,

00:01:33.073 --> 00:01:36.118
there's nothing to worry about
because it works.

00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:38.036
This is our silver lining, okay?

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.579
Just shut your mouth.

00:01:39.663 --> 00:01:42.082
So we'll use this
to shut down the base stations

00:01:42.165 --> 00:01:43.875
and block off all signals?

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:47.379
- Exactly.
- Great idea. That's the surest way.

00:01:47.462 --> 00:01:50.173
Right. We'll block the bombs
from going off at all.

00:01:50.257 --> 00:01:53.260
Even if Sullivan
tries to set the bombs off,

00:01:53.343 --> 00:01:55.971
none will go off without the signal.

00:01:56.054 --> 00:01:58.181
How many base stations
do we have in our town?

00:01:58.265 --> 00:01:59.641
Changri-dong has three.

00:01:59.725 --> 00:02:01.476
Is this enough to cover all three?

00:02:02.477 --> 00:02:05.147
No, I'd need two more, then.

00:02:05.397 --> 00:02:06.398
Hey,

00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:07.858
go visit Ms. Lee.

00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:09.818
- Ms. Lee?
- Yeah. Hey--

00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:11.987
She should be at the bunker.
Why's he in such a hurry?

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.613
Make sure to get them from her!

00:02:13.697 --> 00:02:15.157
We only have one right now.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.409
That's not good. We need two.

00:02:17.492 --> 00:02:18.702
I'll try to get another one.

00:02:18.785 --> 00:02:19.870
Let me know when you do.

00:02:21.663 --> 00:02:23.665
- Take it. It's fine.
- I'm okay.

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:24.916
It's Yong-hui! Yong--

00:02:27.377 --> 00:02:29.212
Do you sell those at your store?

00:02:29.296 --> 00:02:30.881
My store basically has everything.

00:02:30.964 --> 00:02:32.340
If we don't, I'll get it somehow.

00:02:32.424 --> 00:02:33.258
What is it?

00:02:33.884 --> 00:02:35.135
Do you sell EMPs, too?

00:02:35.218 --> 00:02:36.553
EM...

00:02:36.636 --> 00:02:38.138
Is that a soda?

00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:39.598
Who's the manufacturer?

00:02:43.852 --> 00:02:45.312
Do you mean an electromagnetic pulse?

00:02:46.897 --> 00:02:47.898
Yeah.

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:51.067
Do you happen to have one?

00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:52.110
Yeah, I do.

00:02:54.196 --> 00:02:55.071
My gosh.

00:02:55.155 --> 00:02:56.782
Do you? Where is it?

00:02:56.865 --> 00:02:59.034
Back at our lab.

00:03:06.458 --> 00:03:09.628
This is a prototype jamming device
in development.

00:03:09.711 --> 00:03:11.797
Now's not the time for jam!

00:03:12.714 --> 00:03:15.717
No, a jamming device
disrupts radio frequencies.

00:03:15.801 --> 00:03:16.718
So this--

00:03:16.802 --> 00:03:18.970
You're saying this works, right?

00:03:19.596 --> 00:03:20.555
Yes.

00:03:21.807 --> 00:03:23.183
How much is it?

00:03:23.266 --> 00:03:25.894
Oh, come on.
Neighbors should just help each other out.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.813
That's how we bond.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.690
Really? My gosh!

00:03:30.774 --> 00:03:32.526
You're basically Korean now.

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.194
Hey, call me by my name from now on.

00:03:34.277 --> 00:03:35.529
You're one of us now.

00:03:35.612 --> 00:03:38.406
I'll make sure
to treat you big time, okay?

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.574
Su-il.

00:03:40.408 --> 00:03:42.369
Could you promise me

00:03:42.452 --> 00:03:46.748
to get revenge on the guys
who killed my friend, Rashid?

00:03:46.998 --> 00:03:48.625
Please do this for me.

00:03:49.584 --> 00:03:50.418
Ali.

00:03:51.127 --> 00:03:52.045
Don't worry about it.

00:03:52.128 --> 00:03:53.463
I got you, all right?

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.714
Bye.

00:03:55.757 --> 00:03:57.509
I'll be counting on you!

00:04:01.012 --> 00:04:02.973
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

00:04:04.057 --> 00:04:05.225
Let's see.

00:04:06.351 --> 00:04:07.686
Let's take one each,

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.521
check the base stations,

00:04:09.604 --> 00:04:11.022
and set them off from below.

00:04:11.106 --> 00:04:12.732
I'll go to the shopping centers.

00:04:12.816 --> 00:04:13.859
You go to Changri 3-dong.

00:04:13.942 --> 00:04:16.403
Jeong-hwan, please handle the relay tower.

00:04:16.486 --> 00:04:17.320
Okay.

00:04:19.698 --> 00:04:21.867
Good luck, everyone.

00:04:22.367 --> 00:04:23.451
Honey.

00:04:23.702 --> 00:04:24.578
Hold on.

00:04:24.995 --> 00:04:26.872
Don't worry about Min-seo.

00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:29.541
No, it's not that.

00:04:29.624 --> 00:04:32.210
We need you to do something.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.254
Me?

00:04:37.716 --> 00:04:38.592
Hey, what's up?

00:04:39.843 --> 00:04:40.677
What?

00:04:42.262 --> 00:04:43.138
Well...

00:04:43.763 --> 00:04:45.765
If that's the case, of course I'll go.

00:04:45.974 --> 00:04:48.268
Chun-bae, we need to do this.

00:04:48.351 --> 00:04:50.312
We're the only ones who can.

00:04:50.395 --> 00:04:52.731
I know what you mean.

00:04:54.482 --> 00:04:56.735
I'm just worried
that something might happen.

00:04:57.027 --> 00:04:58.862
Hui-ja will be by herself.

00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:02.198
All right, just give me a moment.

00:05:15.211 --> 00:05:16.880
I'm back.

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.924
Min-seo.

00:05:21.468 --> 00:05:22.761
You haven't eaten yet, right?

00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:31.811
Are you going somewhere?

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.981
Yeah, Su-il needs me
to go somewhere with him.

00:05:35.357 --> 00:05:37.567
Let's head home early today.

00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:39.027
I'll be back later.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.445
Is Su-il okay?

00:05:40.528 --> 00:05:43.865
Oh, of course. He's fine.

00:05:44.783 --> 00:05:46.993
- Hello.
- Hey, Min-seo.

00:05:47.077 --> 00:05:48.286
Hi, Min-seo.

00:05:48.703 --> 00:05:50.914
Dad told me
to have dinner with Auntie Hui-ja.

00:05:50.997 --> 00:05:53.541
Don't worry about her. You should go.

00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:55.919
Oh, sure.

00:05:56.002 --> 00:05:58.088
Sure, I'll cook you a feast.

00:05:58.713 --> 00:06:00.840
Can I have dinner
and play a game with her?

00:06:01.257 --> 00:06:02.592
I brought a board game.

00:06:02.676 --> 00:06:04.052
Of course!

00:06:04.135 --> 00:06:06.262
Hui-ja is great at games.

00:06:06.846 --> 00:06:09.057
Don't let Min-seo beat you, okay?

00:06:09.474 --> 00:06:10.558
You'd better be ready.

00:06:18.942 --> 00:06:20.193
Then I'll see you later.

00:06:20.276 --> 00:06:21.611
- See you.
- Okay.

00:06:41.047 --> 00:06:41.881
What is it?

00:06:44.426 --> 00:06:46.386
Don't worry about me. Just go.

00:06:47.387 --> 00:06:50.390
Your face tells me
something is going on around the town.

00:06:50.598 --> 00:06:51.725
No, it's nothing--

00:06:51.808 --> 00:06:53.184
Chun-bae.

00:06:57.897 --> 00:07:00.066
I know I'm unwell, too.

00:07:02.277 --> 00:07:03.695
I'll have dinner with Min-seo

00:07:03.778 --> 00:07:05.780
and make sure to take my meds.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.700
So don't worry. Just go.

00:07:12.287 --> 00:07:13.788
Don't get hurt.

00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:17.751
I'll be right back.

00:07:22.047 --> 00:07:23.089
Go on.

00:09:11.197 --> 00:09:12.532
Thank you for your service.

00:09:32.468 --> 00:09:33.303
Do-yeon...

00:09:37.098 --> 00:09:38.766
Do-yeon!

00:09:52.447 --> 00:09:54.115
Do-yeon...

00:10:08.379 --> 00:10:09.923
- Dad,
- Yeah?

00:10:10.006 --> 00:10:12.467
if I meet a bad adult,
I'll scare them with my whistle.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.470
Yes, make their ears bleed.

00:10:15.553 --> 00:10:16.387
Okay.

00:10:26.064 --> 00:10:27.106
Do-yeon...

00:10:28.816 --> 00:10:29.692
Do-yeon!

00:10:31.152 --> 00:10:32.111
Do-yeon!

00:11:22.787 --> 00:11:23.621
Hey.

00:11:23.705 --> 00:11:24.706
Why are you here?

00:11:25.081 --> 00:11:26.416
Why else? To help you.

00:11:27.417 --> 00:11:28.459
Sorry we scared you.

00:11:28.543 --> 00:11:30.670
I was a sniper
in the Ninth Infantry Division.

00:11:30.753 --> 00:11:33.715
I could even shoot
the butthole of a bird in flight.

00:11:33.798 --> 00:11:35.925
- What?
- This is from Byeong-nam.

00:11:36.009 --> 00:11:37.510
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

00:11:39.512 --> 00:11:40.596
Now, take off your jacket.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.432
- Here, let me.
- Take it off.

00:11:42.849 --> 00:11:44.517
- Here you go.
- All right.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.478
So where's Do-yeon?

00:11:48.187 --> 00:11:49.397
Somewhere in this building.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.482
Stay here for now.

00:11:51.566 --> 00:11:52.817
I'll take it from here.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.902
We have Kang on the line now.

00:11:54.986 --> 00:11:56.404
Everyone can hear me, right?

00:11:56.654 --> 00:11:57.739
Yeah.

00:12:01.534 --> 00:12:02.535
Hey, Kang.

00:12:02.618 --> 00:12:03.494
Are you okay?

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.997
Yeah, I'm heading in now.

00:12:28.061 --> 00:12:31.064
I'll be taking central control now.

00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:34.776
Watch your head.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.613
Wait.

00:12:45.244 --> 00:12:47.121
I gave you all my energy.

00:12:47.205 --> 00:12:48.498
No bullets can get you.

00:12:49.957 --> 00:12:50.958
Thank you.

00:12:51.042 --> 00:12:52.001
Okay.

00:12:52.085 --> 00:12:53.544
Please stay here until I signal you.

00:12:53.628 --> 00:12:54.670
Got it.

00:12:55.922 --> 00:12:56.756
All right.

00:13:06.474 --> 00:13:08.559
Who is Kang, seriously?

00:13:08.643 --> 00:13:09.602
Isn't it obvious?

00:13:09.685 --> 00:13:11.229
He's Changri-dong's hero.

00:14:46.866 --> 00:14:48.701
How are things on your end, Byeong-nam?

00:14:49.285 --> 00:14:50.244
All ready.

00:14:56.042 --> 00:14:57.877
I've just arrived.

00:14:58.252 --> 00:15:00.463
Let me know as soon as you're ready.

00:15:00.546 --> 00:15:01.380
Okay.

00:15:07.094 --> 00:15:09.096
I'm at the Han Building's data center.

00:15:11.849 --> 00:15:13.226
Good work, Nam-yeon.

00:15:13.851 --> 00:15:15.895
By the way, Yong-hui.

00:15:16.854 --> 00:15:21.359
Couldn't you have done this
by hacking into the system?

00:15:22.193 --> 00:15:25.279
We have the best chance
of succeeding this way.

00:15:25.655 --> 00:15:26.572
Fine.

00:18:05.815 --> 00:18:06.649
Do-yeon.

00:18:35.219 --> 00:18:36.303
The site is clear.

00:18:36.804 --> 00:18:37.930
Moving underground.

00:18:44.311 --> 00:18:45.855
Kang is in the building.

00:18:46.439 --> 00:18:50.025
All communications will be blocked
once the EMPs go off,

00:18:50.109 --> 00:18:52.903
so make sure to send the signal right away
when you've succeeded.

00:18:53.362 --> 00:18:55.030
Please get everything ready and stand by.

00:18:55.781 --> 00:18:56.782
- Got it.
- Okay.

00:19:02.288 --> 00:19:03.456
I can do it.

00:19:47.082 --> 00:19:48.042
Do-yeon!

00:19:50.503 --> 00:19:51.462
Dad!

00:19:53.214 --> 00:19:55.549
Do-yeon!

00:19:57.426 --> 00:19:59.345
Are you okay, Do-yeon?

00:19:59.887 --> 00:20:02.681
Yeah, we had fun drawing pictures.

00:20:03.474 --> 00:20:04.683
You had fun?

00:20:04.767 --> 00:20:05.601
Yeah.

00:20:20.449 --> 00:20:21.617
Retrieve the bombs.

00:20:22.618 --> 00:20:23.744
You still have time.

00:20:27.081 --> 00:20:28.374
Will people remember Charlotte

00:20:30.459 --> 00:20:32.545
if I just stop here?

00:20:32.878 --> 00:20:36.423
The kids and their families
with your bombs...

00:20:36.715 --> 00:20:38.300
They're just innocent people.

00:20:42.471 --> 00:20:43.973
Innocent?

00:20:57.611 --> 00:20:59.321
Had a single soul spoken up

00:21:00.281 --> 00:21:01.907
about the trial being rigged,

00:21:04.285 --> 00:21:05.995
we wouldn't have ended up this way.

00:21:06.078 --> 00:21:07.246
My gosh...

00:21:07.329 --> 00:21:09.456
Everyone in Korea is at fault.

00:21:10.499 --> 00:21:12.001
That's why I'm doing this.

00:21:12.751 --> 00:21:14.169
So that everyone will remember today

00:21:15.254 --> 00:21:17.006
in piles of ashes.

00:21:21.093 --> 00:21:22.678
You think

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:24.847
Charlotte would be happy

00:21:25.639 --> 00:21:27.308
if you killed everyone for revenge?

00:21:48.245 --> 00:21:49.246
Do-yeon.

00:21:54.126 --> 00:21:55.377
Could you give

00:21:56.795 --> 00:21:58.005
the phone to Daddy?

00:22:02.468 --> 00:22:03.385
Here.

00:22:13.729 --> 00:22:17.107
If you press that, Do-yeon will live,

00:22:17.441 --> 00:22:18.901
but all your neighbors will die.

00:22:19.818 --> 00:22:20.819
If you don't press it,

00:22:23.989 --> 00:22:25.407
Do-yeon will die.

00:22:35.209 --> 00:22:36.919
Let's get started!

00:22:37.503 --> 00:22:38.879
Everyone ready?

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:40.547
Ready.

00:22:41.423 --> 00:22:42.466
Me too.

00:22:46.428 --> 00:22:47.972
Please help us.

00:22:52.643 --> 00:22:54.228
You can choose to save Do-yeon

00:22:54.853 --> 00:22:59.650
or your neighbors,
whom you claim are innocent.

00:23:04.071 --> 00:23:05.072
Okay.

00:23:05.823 --> 00:23:07.533
Please, let's get this done in one go

00:23:08.367 --> 00:23:09.702
without mistakes.

00:23:10.411 --> 00:23:11.245
One,

00:23:12.371 --> 00:23:13.205
two,

00:23:14.957 --> 00:23:15.791
three!

00:23:58.917 --> 00:23:59.793
It worked.

00:24:45.923 --> 00:24:47.049
Why didn't it go off there?

00:24:48.383 --> 00:24:49.218
Nam-yeon.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.636
Nam-yeon!

00:24:51.261 --> 00:24:53.972
What's going on, Nam-yeon?

00:24:58.769 --> 00:24:59.645
What the...

00:24:59.728 --> 00:25:01.480
Nam-yeon's station hasn't gone off!

00:25:01.563 --> 00:25:03.315
Nam-yeon?

00:25:06.819 --> 00:25:08.737
Yong-hui, this isn't working!

00:25:08.821 --> 00:25:10.072
What?

00:25:10.155 --> 00:25:13.117
SAFE GAS STATION

00:25:19.331 --> 00:25:23.043
Do you see electrical wires
connected to the equipment?

00:25:23.127 --> 00:25:24.878
They should be tied as one.

00:25:26.505 --> 00:25:27.381
Are you kidding me...

00:25:33.053 --> 00:25:34.054
Yeah, I found it!

00:25:34.388 --> 00:25:35.639
Then...

00:25:35.722 --> 00:25:37.015
Just cut that off!

00:25:44.523 --> 00:25:45.732
Make up your mind.

00:25:53.615 --> 00:25:54.533
Cut it off!

00:25:54.616 --> 00:25:55.659
Just cut it!

00:25:55.951 --> 00:25:57.703
Just chop it off, Nam-yeon!

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.204
Cut it!

00:26:40.704 --> 00:26:41.914
Ms. Lee!

00:26:56.762 --> 00:26:58.805
How dare you, huh?

00:27:40.722 --> 00:27:41.765
Press the damn button!

00:27:55.529 --> 00:27:56.655
I trust them.

00:28:05.914 --> 00:28:09.001
We'll do everything to stop the bombs.

00:28:09.251 --> 00:28:12.337
So you just focus
on bringing Do-yeon back.

00:28:13.714 --> 00:28:14.548
I...

00:28:16.425 --> 00:28:18.051
choose Do-yeon.

00:28:56.465 --> 00:28:58.633
We did it!

00:29:05.474 --> 00:29:07.476
We did it.

00:29:08.143 --> 00:29:09.895
Fireworks.

00:29:10.562 --> 00:29:12.939
Fireworks! They went off!

00:29:13.023 --> 00:29:14.441
It's over!

00:29:14.524 --> 00:29:17.027
We did it! Yes!

00:29:17.944 --> 00:29:19.863
We did it!

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.534
A win for the Heroes Next Door!

00:29:31.792 --> 00:29:33.543
Yes!

00:29:33.627 --> 00:29:35.379
We did it! Amazing!

00:30:47.701 --> 00:30:48.535
It's okay.

00:30:49.494 --> 00:30:50.704
It's okay.

00:30:50.787 --> 00:30:52.873
- Daddy's here.
- I'm scared!

00:30:52.956 --> 00:30:54.708
It's okay.

00:31:08.763 --> 00:31:09.931
Do-yeon.

00:31:16.897 --> 00:31:18.106
Goodbye.

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:29.576
Do-yeon.

00:31:29.993 --> 00:31:31.119
Go upstairs,

00:31:31.203 --> 00:31:33.830
and you'll see the uncles
from the store and the laundry place.

00:31:34.247 --> 00:31:36.917
Go ahead and wait. I'll be there soon.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.003
No, come with me.

00:31:40.837 --> 00:31:42.547
I'll be there soon.

00:31:42.631 --> 00:31:43.507
Go ahead.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.550
Okay? Good girl.

00:31:48.136 --> 00:31:49.679
Don't take too long.

00:31:49.763 --> 00:31:50.597
Okay.

00:31:52.265 --> 00:31:53.266
All right, go on.

00:32:08.323 --> 00:32:09.908
- Do-yeon!
- Mr. Kim!

00:32:09.991 --> 00:32:11.826
Do-yeon! My gosh!

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:13.703
What about my dad?

00:32:13.787 --> 00:32:15.372
He'll be fine.

00:32:15.455 --> 00:32:16.373
Here.

00:32:17.082 --> 00:32:18.542
- Sit right here.
- Daddy!

00:32:18.625 --> 00:32:19.709
It's okay.

00:33:19.728 --> 00:33:21.521
I just wanted people to remember

00:33:22.981 --> 00:33:24.983
how unfair Charlotte's death was.

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:30.947
I thought

00:33:33.033 --> 00:33:34.659
you'd understand me.

00:33:36.411 --> 00:33:37.829
You would've done the same

00:33:39.205 --> 00:33:42.000
if it were Do-yeon, wouldn't you?

00:33:49.633 --> 00:33:51.009
My daughter died,

00:33:51.718 --> 00:33:53.511
but the world hasn't changed.

00:33:55.305 --> 00:33:56.681
I just wanted to make sure

00:33:58.099 --> 00:34:00.685
that nobody would face
such undeserved grief again.

00:34:01.394 --> 00:34:02.395
But...

00:34:03.938 --> 00:34:05.690
you stopped me!

00:34:09.402 --> 00:34:10.570
Seriously, man.

00:34:11.738 --> 00:34:13.782
You sure yap a lot.

00:34:18.036 --> 00:34:19.579
Cut the crap.

00:34:21.915 --> 00:34:22.791
This is

00:34:24.668 --> 00:34:26.461
for kidnapping Do-yeon,

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:29.881
turning my town into a mess,

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:35.595
and killing Myeong-o,
who didn't deserve to die.

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:47.273
What about my little girl?

00:34:48.817 --> 00:34:50.944
What about Charlotte,
who did nothing wrong?

00:34:55.281 --> 00:34:56.449
You're still talking?

00:35:01.746 --> 00:35:02.664
Hey.

00:35:03.957 --> 00:35:06.418
You were the one who ruined your chance

00:35:07.168 --> 00:35:08.962
to honor the memory of Charlotte.

00:35:11.923 --> 00:35:13.383
You're just...

00:35:14.801 --> 00:35:18.888
a deranged terrorist.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:23.727
Got that, you lunatic?

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:57.093
Is Charlotte in heaven, then?

00:36:13.777 --> 00:36:14.611
Mr. Sullivan.

00:36:15.445 --> 00:36:18.948
This is Pinky, and I really like her.

00:36:19.866 --> 00:36:20.700
But...

00:36:22.285 --> 00:36:23.787
you can have her.

00:36:26.414 --> 00:36:29.542
Because Charlotte also loved bunnies.

00:36:30.543 --> 00:36:35.507
Pinky will make you feel better
whenever you miss Charlotte.

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.468
Here.

00:36:40.303 --> 00:36:43.097
It even lights up
to make you feel safe at night.

00:36:46.434 --> 00:36:47.769
Pinky will...

00:36:47.852 --> 00:36:49.020
No.

00:36:49.103 --> 00:36:52.190
Charlotte will always be by your side.

00:37:03.743 --> 00:37:04.869
Thank you.

00:37:58.756 --> 00:38:00.133
It's all over now.

00:38:00.717 --> 00:38:01.718
What about Sullivan?

00:38:03.386 --> 00:38:05.889
He's on the underground level
of the Novus Warehouse.

00:38:08.808 --> 00:38:09.767
Good work.

00:38:11.477 --> 00:38:12.854
We'll take care of the rest.

00:38:18.276 --> 00:38:19.611
Daddy!

00:38:21.029 --> 00:38:22.447
- Hey.
- Kang!

00:38:25.325 --> 00:38:26.200
Kang!

00:38:27.869 --> 00:38:29.120
Are you okay?

00:38:29.203 --> 00:38:30.163
- I'm okay.
- Kang!

00:38:31.831 --> 00:38:32.999
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

00:38:33.333 --> 00:38:34.584
Need me to wrap things up?

00:38:35.501 --> 00:38:36.878
- Let's go.
- Yeah?

00:38:36.961 --> 00:38:38.588
- Good job.
- Gosh, good work.

00:39:33.685 --> 00:39:35.520
Sit tight, okay?

00:39:40.984 --> 00:39:42.151
Thank you.

00:39:42.235 --> 00:39:43.486
Should I drive?

00:39:43.903 --> 00:39:44.821
No, I can drive.

00:39:45.613 --> 00:39:47.031
What? You'll drive?

00:39:47.115 --> 00:39:48.866
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:40:05.508 --> 00:40:09.345
FIFTH EXPLOSION
ON SEPT 18, 2025 AT 00:00 A.M.

00:40:09.429 --> 00:40:12.724
THE ANNIVERSARY OF CHARLOTTE'S DEATH

00:40:32.952 --> 00:40:33.786
What?

00:40:41.335 --> 00:40:42.211
Is everyone okay?

00:40:42.295 --> 00:40:43.963
- Kang, are you okay?
- Kang!

00:40:44.047 --> 00:40:45.339
- Are you okay?
- Guys!

00:40:45.423 --> 00:40:46.549
I'm fine.

00:40:46.632 --> 00:40:47.717
Are you all right?

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.218
- Good job.
- Are you okay?

00:40:49.302 --> 00:40:50.678
- Yeah.
- Good job.

00:40:50.762 --> 00:40:51.971
- My gosh.
- Good work!

00:40:52.055 --> 00:40:53.222
- I'm so glad.
- Gosh.

00:40:53.306 --> 00:40:54.557
- Good job, all of you.
- You, too.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:55.892
- Good job.
- You were great.

00:40:55.975 --> 00:40:57.769
- Did you get hurt?
- No, I'm fine.

00:40:57.852 --> 00:40:59.437
- I told you we were fine.
- Really?

00:41:20.833 --> 00:41:22.126
Mommy...

00:41:26.047 --> 00:41:27.840
Don't cry, Mommy.

00:42:11.884 --> 00:42:15.346
What are you doing out in the cold?

00:42:16.597 --> 00:42:17.932
I was waiting for you.

00:42:18.015 --> 00:42:18.891
Oh, my.

00:42:19.517 --> 00:42:20.893
Your hands are frozen!

00:42:20.977 --> 00:42:23.354
Let's head inside already.

00:42:27.859 --> 00:42:28.860
Are you sleepy?

00:42:28.943 --> 00:42:29.777
Yeah.

00:42:31.571 --> 00:42:33.156
- Mom.
- Yeah?

00:42:33.239 --> 00:42:35.867
Remember how you promised
to buy me sneakers?

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:38.411
Yeah, those sneakers. What about them?

00:42:38.786 --> 00:42:41.164
Can you sign me up
for martial arts classes instead?

00:42:41.914 --> 00:42:44.041
Why? Is someone bullying you?

00:42:44.125 --> 00:42:46.210
Who is it? Who's bullying you?

00:42:46.294 --> 00:42:47.628
Take me to their house.

00:42:47.712 --> 00:42:49.422
- Who dares...
- It's nothing like that.

00:42:49.505 --> 00:42:50.923
- What?
- Huh?

00:42:51.007 --> 00:42:53.843
You're going to become like Mom
if you learn martial arts.

00:42:53.926 --> 00:42:56.053
That's nonsense. Why, then?

00:42:56.137 --> 00:42:57.430
- You hate exercising.
- I'm doomed.

00:42:57.513 --> 00:42:59.432
- Stop it.
- Don't fight people.

00:42:59.515 --> 00:43:01.100
We'll take care of it for you.

00:43:03.102 --> 00:43:04.145
Goodness.

00:43:16.032 --> 00:43:18.242
I'm glad that everyone is fine.

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:21.913
- Byeong-nam!
- Byeong-nam!

00:43:21.996 --> 00:43:22.955
Emergency!

00:43:23.039 --> 00:43:24.248
What is it now?

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:25.666
I'm hungry.

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:26.584
You little...

00:43:26.667 --> 00:43:28.252
- Me too.
- You're kidding me!

00:43:28.961 --> 00:43:32.381
You scared me, you little punks!

00:43:33.382 --> 00:43:34.926
Okay, then.

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.470
How about some instant noodles
and some rice wine?

00:43:37.553 --> 00:43:38.888
Yes! INRW it is!

00:43:38.971 --> 00:43:40.014
All right. Wait, what?

00:43:40.097 --> 00:43:41.974
Some INRW coming right up!

00:43:42.934 --> 00:43:43.893
Hey.

00:43:44.435 --> 00:43:46.270
I said instant noodles and rice wine.

00:43:47.146 --> 00:43:49.190
Okay? What even is INRW?

00:43:52.485 --> 00:43:53.694
Around 12 a.m. last night,

00:43:53.778 --> 00:43:58.449
a warehouse near the Hanbal Mountain
in Kiyun-si exploded,

00:43:58.532 --> 00:44:02.453
damaging the walls and the pillars
of two factory buildings.

00:44:02.536 --> 00:44:05.790
The fire department reported
that no one was injured or killed,

00:44:05.873 --> 00:44:08.376
and found that the explosion occurred

00:44:08.459 --> 00:44:10.378
at the helium gas tank in the warehouse.

00:44:10.461 --> 00:44:12.713
The investigation into
the exact cause is still ongoing.

00:44:14.507 --> 00:44:17.218
HARDWARE DREAM TREE STATIONERY

00:44:23.057 --> 00:44:24.475
Is the wind too weak?

00:44:25.226 --> 00:44:26.894
Let's try again.

00:44:29.063 --> 00:44:30.523
- That's nice and cool.
- Hey.

00:44:30.606 --> 00:44:31.440
Hey.

00:44:31.524 --> 00:44:32.358
All right.

00:44:33.943 --> 00:44:35.569
- What are you doing?
- Perfect.

00:44:36.195 --> 00:44:37.321
You do daytime rounds, too?

00:44:37.405 --> 00:44:38.531
What? No.

00:44:38.614 --> 00:44:43.286
Hey, what do you think of my new
hot-cooling protective vest?

00:44:43.703 --> 00:44:44.870
- "Hot-cooling"?
- Yeah.

00:44:45.705 --> 00:44:47.164
So is it heating or cooling?

00:44:47.248 --> 00:44:48.374
Come on.

00:44:48.457 --> 00:44:50.876
It's both heating and cooling.

00:44:51.168 --> 00:44:54.380
Most functional vests
can only do one or the other.

00:44:54.672 --> 00:44:57.591
But this can keep you both warm and cool.

00:44:57.842 --> 00:44:59.135
This is the heating pad,

00:44:59.218 --> 00:45:00.845
and these are the cooling fans.

00:45:01.846 --> 00:45:03.764
And check this out.

00:45:06.142 --> 00:45:09.395
Chun-bae did the lettering himself.

00:45:09.729 --> 00:45:11.897
I know it sounds lame,

00:45:11.981 --> 00:45:14.275
but apparently
Su-il really pushed for this.

00:45:14.358 --> 00:45:15.276
What do you think?

00:45:15.359 --> 00:45:19.238
Everyone in this neighborhood is so weird.

00:45:20.448 --> 00:45:23.117
Hey, you know your neighbors.

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:25.119
If we're doing something,
we always do it right.

00:45:26.037 --> 00:45:27.621
I did something right too.

00:45:28.581 --> 00:45:29.415
What?

00:45:30.333 --> 00:45:31.584
I didn't kill anyone.

00:45:35.212 --> 00:45:36.505
Look at you.

00:45:38.215 --> 00:45:40.843
All right. You're the next president
of the youth association.

00:45:41.802 --> 00:45:43.471
What are you talking about?

00:45:43.554 --> 00:45:47.350
You can be the president forever,
little bro.

00:45:47.558 --> 00:45:50.603
Why? Are you planning to move?

00:45:53.064 --> 00:45:54.106
I'll be something else.

00:45:54.648 --> 00:45:55.483
What?

00:45:56.108 --> 00:45:57.276
The neighborhood watch leader.

00:46:02.114 --> 00:46:04.033
I SHALL REVEAL THE TRUTH
AND BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE

00:46:04.116 --> 00:46:05.534
Recently,

00:46:05.868 --> 00:46:10.581
a young man from Kiyun-si
died an undeserving death.

00:46:10.664 --> 00:46:13.334
But that wasn't just an accident.

00:46:13.417 --> 00:46:15.628
This case concerned the corruption

00:46:15.711 --> 00:46:18.047
of the Minister of National Defense.

00:46:20.841 --> 00:46:23.135
This is incredibly disheartening.

00:46:24.678 --> 00:46:25.930
Today,

00:46:27.306 --> 00:46:30.643
I will take responsibility
for failing to uncover the truth

00:46:30.726 --> 00:46:33.521
behind the unfortunate incident
in Kiyun-si

00:46:34.814 --> 00:46:38.776
and step down from the National Assembly.

00:46:58.754 --> 00:47:01.382
KIM SEOK-JUN

00:47:02.258 --> 00:47:03.092
Hello?

00:47:03.676 --> 00:47:06.679
How did you manage to get out?

00:47:06.762 --> 00:47:09.682
Come on, I'm Kim Seok-jun.

00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:16.272
I see that you've sold my name on TV.

00:47:16.522 --> 00:47:18.190
Sell your name?

00:47:18.607 --> 00:47:20.192
I was just telling the truth!

00:47:20.276 --> 00:47:21.110
Hey.

00:47:22.153 --> 00:47:23.529
Bring me my money.

00:47:25.573 --> 00:47:27.241
Do I owe you money?

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.452
I'll get straight to the point.

00:47:30.578 --> 00:47:32.163
Just listen to this.

00:47:36.041 --> 00:47:37.877
How much do you trust me?

00:47:39.336 --> 00:47:41.088
Get a bomb ready.

00:47:42.548 --> 00:47:44.091
To blow up Kiyun-si.

00:47:55.144 --> 00:47:57.771
Buy my land in Kiyun-si.

00:47:58.147 --> 00:47:59.940
With cash by tonight.

00:48:00.024 --> 00:48:02.651
Or I'll send this
straight to the news channels.

00:48:03.068 --> 00:48:06.572
Oh, should I send it
to the Prosecutor's Office, too?

00:48:06.947 --> 00:48:08.616
Do you realize how much money that is?

00:48:08.949 --> 00:48:11.243
How can I get all that cash within a day?

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:14.830
I don't know. That's none of my business.

00:48:15.206 --> 00:48:17.208
Why are you asking me that?

00:48:17.958 --> 00:48:20.419
You have until tonight, okay?

00:48:20.628 --> 00:48:24.006
Get me the money in US dollars.

00:48:24.924 --> 00:48:26.759
I'll send you the location.

00:48:26.842 --> 00:48:28.844
- See you there.
- Hey, Seok-jun--

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:31.972
You crazy bastard! Hey!

00:48:38.938 --> 00:48:40.314
You wanted to make a deal.

00:48:41.524 --> 00:48:42.900
Do something about this.

00:49:03.587 --> 00:49:05.214
Well, hello.

00:49:06.674 --> 00:49:08.342
Ms. Na!

00:49:09.593 --> 00:49:11.178
Don't act like we're friends.

00:49:11.554 --> 00:49:12.846
Hand over the original recording.

00:49:13.138 --> 00:49:13.973
All right.

00:49:15.766 --> 00:49:16.684
Ta-da!

00:49:19.728 --> 00:49:20.980
Stop trying to play tricks.

00:49:21.063 --> 00:49:22.481
Bring me the money.

00:49:24.608 --> 00:49:26.735
You never change, do you?

00:49:28.028 --> 00:49:30.030
So consistently trashy.

00:49:31.156 --> 00:49:32.199
Right back at you.

00:49:49.883 --> 00:49:50.759
Open it.

00:49:59.435 --> 00:50:00.394
Bring it over.

00:50:07.526 --> 00:50:09.236
Give me the original recording.

00:50:13.282 --> 00:50:14.908
Yeah, sure.

00:50:16.827 --> 00:50:19.413
The original file is in here.

00:50:19.496 --> 00:50:20.706
Take the whole thing.

00:50:22.458 --> 00:50:23.834
Now hand over the money!

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:37.598
Ms. Na,

00:50:39.099 --> 00:50:40.851
good luck in your future endeavors.

00:51:05.876 --> 00:51:08.921
It's all over now, Mr. Kim.

00:51:11.715 --> 00:51:14.927
Lee Geun-cheol, you little rat!

00:51:16.845 --> 00:51:18.555
Hey! Stop it!

00:51:19.431 --> 00:51:20.307
You've been...

00:51:21.225 --> 00:51:22.267
dismissed from office.

00:51:23.227 --> 00:51:25.229
The President approved
the motion to dismiss you.

00:51:25.604 --> 00:51:27.022
We got your arrest warrant, too.

00:51:28.107 --> 00:51:30.192
Fine, just let go of me.

00:51:30.275 --> 00:51:31.402
Let go!

00:51:33.487 --> 00:51:36.448
Wait just a damn minute.

00:51:36.824 --> 00:51:38.826
I just...

00:51:39.368 --> 00:51:42.037
What do I do?

00:51:42.121 --> 00:51:44.873
Hey, you guys!

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:46.959
I'll pay you guys.

00:51:47.584 --> 00:51:50.003
Let me go, please?

00:51:50.087 --> 00:51:52.631
Take this money and let me go.

00:51:52.715 --> 00:51:54.967
Here, take it all!

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:56.969
I'll pay you.

00:51:57.052 --> 00:51:58.220
- Arrest him.
- Yes, sir.

00:51:58.303 --> 00:52:01.807
No, don't do that!

00:52:02.766 --> 00:52:07.229
I dedicated my entire life
to this country!

00:52:07.312 --> 00:52:09.898
How dare you treat me like this?

00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:11.942
So what if I sold a few weapons?

00:52:13.235 --> 00:52:15.112
Can't I do that much as the Minister?

00:52:15.946 --> 00:52:17.573
Let go!

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:43.056
I took the blame
and took care of everything.

00:52:44.057 --> 00:52:46.059
So speed up the bill
for the IT specialized zone, okay?

00:52:47.019 --> 00:52:49.605
You know I stepped down
just for that, right?

00:52:54.151 --> 00:52:58.238
I'm not greedy for power.

00:53:00.532 --> 00:53:02.785
You know what? Just tell me.

00:53:02.868 --> 00:53:03.744
When?

00:53:10.667 --> 00:53:13.837
Isn't that too soon?

00:53:18.175 --> 00:53:21.053
Let's talk again after this year.

00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:24.389
Okay, Mr. Kwon.

00:53:36.944 --> 00:53:42.908
EXCLUSIVE VIDEO OF THE DEMISE
OF THE MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

00:53:42.991 --> 00:53:44.159
UPLOADING

00:54:14.648 --> 00:54:17.651
In memory of Charlotte,
who died in an unfortunate accident

00:54:21.071 --> 00:54:22.364
three years ago.

00:54:48.849 --> 00:54:51.101
- My goodness!
- Grandma!

00:54:51.184 --> 00:54:53.729
- There's my girl.
- Yeah.

00:54:53.812 --> 00:54:56.356
- Hello.
- Hey.

00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.150
Mom, why did you want to meet here?

00:54:58.233 --> 00:55:02.613
I heard my little Do-yeon
wanted to learn how to ride a bike.

00:55:02.696 --> 00:55:03.655
Do-yeon.

00:55:04.448 --> 00:55:06.825
Look around.

00:55:06.909 --> 00:55:07.743
What do you think?

00:55:08.368 --> 00:55:09.953
- It's so cool!
- You think so?

00:55:10.037 --> 00:55:12.623
- There are so many bikes!
- Right?

00:55:13.206 --> 00:55:14.583
There's even more inside.

00:55:14.875 --> 00:55:16.001
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:55:16.084 --> 00:55:19.212
Daddy and I went on a date here once.

00:55:20.005 --> 00:55:21.924
A date?

00:55:22.215 --> 00:55:23.759
You must've held hands and kissed, too!

00:55:23.842 --> 00:55:24.927
Oh, my.

00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:27.262
Hey, we had to do all that to have...

00:55:27.679 --> 00:55:28.972
Oh, my!

00:55:29.431 --> 00:55:30.432
Bye!

00:55:30.974 --> 00:55:32.726
Wait for us, Do-yeon.

00:55:33.185 --> 00:55:34.770
- Where are you going?
- My goodness.

00:55:34.853 --> 00:55:36.480
- Wait for me!
- Let's go.

00:55:36.563 --> 00:55:38.273
THE NOSTALGIC FIRST TRICYCLE OF MY LIFE
Look at that, Do-yeon.

00:55:38.941 --> 00:55:41.068
I also rode a tricycle as a baby.

00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:43.570
Grandma got that for you.

00:55:44.404 --> 00:55:46.657
- Really?
- Of course.

00:55:48.075 --> 00:55:51.370
By the way,
why are there so many bikes here?

00:55:54.957 --> 00:55:58.126
There are all sorts of bikes,
from cool ones to old ones.

00:55:58.669 --> 00:56:00.754
Looking at bikes
makes me want to ride one.

00:56:00.837 --> 00:56:02.506
Are you good at riding one?

00:56:02.589 --> 00:56:03.465
Of course.

00:56:03.548 --> 00:56:04.841
When I was your age,

00:56:04.925 --> 00:56:07.135
I went around my whole town on my bike.

00:56:07.219 --> 00:56:08.553
I want to ride a bike, too, then!

00:56:08.637 --> 00:56:09.888
I want to be like you.

00:56:09.972 --> 00:56:11.306
Let's ride one together.

00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:12.265
Okay!

00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:17.562
Yes, you're doing great.

00:56:18.021 --> 00:56:21.024
- What do I do?
- Keep pedaling. Right on!

00:56:21.483 --> 00:56:25.821
I'm letting go now!

00:56:27.531 --> 00:56:28.657
My goodness.

00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:31.618
I can see hearts
shooting out of Kang's eyes.

00:56:32.369 --> 00:56:33.662
Don't even get me started.

00:56:33.745 --> 00:56:35.497
He's all about Do-yeon all day, every day.

00:56:35.998 --> 00:56:37.332
He's not just a sucker for Do-yeon.

00:56:37.416 --> 00:56:39.710
Sometimes, he just sucks.

00:56:40.335 --> 00:56:41.586
My gosh.

00:56:42.212 --> 00:56:43.797
- Am I good?
- Yes.

00:56:44.172 --> 00:56:45.257
Be careful.

00:56:45.882 --> 00:56:47.592
- Okay.
- If you're lonely,

00:56:47.676 --> 00:56:50.262
have a son who will look for you more.

00:56:50.345 --> 00:56:53.515
Mom, I do have a son, remember?

00:56:54.141 --> 00:56:56.435
Over there. That huge boy is my son.

00:56:56.518 --> 00:56:57.853
Mom!

00:57:07.863 --> 00:57:10.115
Dad, this is so much fun.

00:57:10.198 --> 00:57:12.367
- Let's come back again, okay?
- Yeah!

00:57:12.784 --> 00:57:14.911
Honey, I'm having so much fun, too.

00:57:14.995 --> 00:57:16.747
Let's come back again, okay?

00:57:16.830 --> 00:57:19.249
Okay, let's come back.

00:57:20.208 --> 00:57:22.502
Go faster, Dad!

00:57:22.586 --> 00:57:24.671
Ladies, are you wearing your seat belts?

00:57:24.755 --> 00:57:26.048
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:57:26.131 --> 00:57:27.883
Let's go for it!

00:57:27.966 --> 00:57:29.593
Here we go, then!

00:57:55.952 --> 00:57:57.621
Our Do-yeon is all grown.

00:57:57.704 --> 00:57:59.081
She can even ride a bike now.

00:58:00.624 --> 00:58:02.751
She's very athletic
because she takes after me.

00:58:07.464 --> 00:58:09.299
I'm so glad we came.

00:58:09.382 --> 00:58:10.217
Yeah.

00:58:10.383 --> 00:58:12.636
She seems to have forgotten
all about what happened.

00:58:13.053 --> 00:58:14.346
Again, she takes after me.

00:58:14.429 --> 00:58:15.722
She's simple.

00:58:15.806 --> 00:58:16.848
It's a good thing.

00:58:16.932 --> 00:58:19.518
Sure, she takes after you in everything!

00:58:22.813 --> 00:58:23.814
Once we get home,

00:58:23.897 --> 00:58:26.316
let's invite all our neighbors
for a housewarming party.

00:58:26.399 --> 00:58:29.903
I haven't properly thanked everyone
for taking care of Do-yeon yet.

00:58:31.404 --> 00:58:32.322
It's a plan.

00:58:35.659 --> 00:58:36.868
Get some sleep.

00:58:37.786 --> 00:58:40.288
No, you must be tired too.

00:58:46.711 --> 00:58:49.589
MAMMOSEU MART

00:58:51.299 --> 00:58:52.509
I'll take these.

00:58:53.009 --> 00:58:54.177
Okay.

00:58:55.929 --> 00:58:58.265
Do you cook in your lab, too?

00:58:58.348 --> 00:59:00.809
No, I cook at home.

00:59:02.144 --> 00:59:04.437
All you ate were instant noodles,
but you cook now.

00:59:05.814 --> 00:59:07.440
What was your membership number?

00:59:07.524 --> 00:59:10.235
- It's 2406.
- All right.

00:59:10.902 --> 00:59:12.112
You're a diamond customer.

00:59:13.613 --> 00:59:14.489
All right.

00:59:20.328 --> 00:59:21.329
Here you go.

00:59:25.083 --> 00:59:26.209
Su-il.

00:59:26.585 --> 00:59:28.003
POINTS EARNED: 100,000 WON
What's this?

00:59:29.171 --> 00:59:31.923
I told you I'd treat you big time.

00:59:32.007 --> 00:59:33.300
This is like cash.

00:59:33.383 --> 00:59:34.676
- What? Really?
- Yeah.

00:59:34.759 --> 00:59:37.012
Use the points when I'm here, okay?

00:59:38.013 --> 00:59:39.723
Thanks, Su-il.

00:59:41.266 --> 00:59:43.810
- But when my wife--
- Wow, 100,000 points?

00:59:48.148 --> 00:59:49.399
Honey...

00:59:50.734 --> 00:59:51.902
Good job.

00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:55.238
I did a good job?

00:59:55.322 --> 00:59:57.115
- Come and use them anytime.
- See you.

00:59:57.199 --> 00:59:58.241
Thank you.

01:00:01.077 --> 01:00:02.454
KIM MYEONG-O

01:00:04.456 --> 01:00:08.210
Hey, I got the guy who killed you.

01:00:10.295 --> 01:00:12.047
With the guys in the neighborhood.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:16.843
See you again.

01:00:42.244 --> 01:00:44.037
It really looks like a candle!

01:00:46.665 --> 01:00:47.707
Min-seo.

01:00:48.041 --> 01:00:51.253
Until that day

01:00:51.628 --> 01:00:54.214
When the waters of the East Sea run dry

01:00:54.839 --> 01:00:55.757
Right on.

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.717
You know the video
for the national anthem?

01:00:57.801 --> 01:00:59.344
The video is from this view.

01:01:02.430 --> 01:01:04.432
You really know everything, Jeong-hwan.

01:01:04.933 --> 01:01:06.810
Everyone knows that.

01:01:07.310 --> 01:01:08.436
I didn't.

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:10.563
I just learned it today, too.

01:01:11.481 --> 01:01:13.066
It's actually
my first time hearing it too.

01:01:17.112 --> 01:01:18.113
Su-jin,

01:01:18.196 --> 01:01:20.532
do you really need good grades
to become a soldier?

01:01:21.408 --> 01:01:22.784
Not really.

01:01:25.912 --> 01:01:27.998
Why do you want to become a soldier?

01:01:28.373 --> 01:01:30.000
Did you see that video of my mom?

01:01:30.083 --> 01:01:32.836
She saved someone with her kick.
That's so awesome.

01:01:34.754 --> 01:01:35.714
Let's go.

01:01:38.049 --> 01:01:38.925
Hey.

01:01:39.384 --> 01:01:40.427
What is it?

01:01:40.510 --> 01:01:42.512
Did you really have to tag along?

01:01:43.013 --> 01:01:45.598
I'm just here as Min-seo's tutor.

01:01:47.851 --> 01:01:48.893
Good luck.

01:01:50.645 --> 01:01:51.479
Fine.

01:01:52.939 --> 01:01:55.859
Man, the ocean breeze is so nice.

01:01:56.484 --> 01:01:57.569
Wait for me!

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.074
Wait up!

01:02:03.825 --> 01:02:06.453
Man, what's taking Yong-hui so long?

01:02:07.954 --> 01:02:08.997
Come on!

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.874
No, you can go first!

01:02:16.588 --> 01:02:18.006
- Are you scared?
- What?

01:02:18.089 --> 01:02:18.965
Of course not.

01:02:38.026 --> 01:02:39.194
Mission success.

01:02:39.277 --> 01:02:40.111
Success.

01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:42.864
- No, wait--
- Let's run!

01:02:44.574 --> 01:02:45.700
It's fun, right?

01:02:54.334 --> 01:02:55.627
PLASTIC SURGERY

01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:57.295
The doctor will see you now.

01:02:58.755 --> 01:03:00.673
Let me take a look.

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:07.389
Wow, you're really fit.

01:03:09.557 --> 01:03:11.309
Okay, all good.

01:03:11.810 --> 01:03:12.977
Have a seat.

01:03:17.315 --> 01:03:18.274
Doctor,

01:03:18.608 --> 01:03:21.694
I'd like to part ways with the monster
and start a new life.

01:03:22.153 --> 01:03:24.030
Do you think it's possible?

01:03:24.114 --> 01:03:25.657
Of course.

01:03:26.074 --> 01:03:28.243
But the thing about tattoos is

01:03:28.326 --> 01:03:32.122
that they require a lot more care
than you'd think.

01:03:32.205 --> 01:03:34.416
It'll cost a lot, won't it?

01:03:34.499 --> 01:03:37.210
Of course, that's usually the case.

01:03:38.753 --> 01:03:40.588
But you have insurance, right?

01:03:41.756 --> 01:03:44.008
Does insurance cover this?

01:03:45.218 --> 01:03:46.136
Yes.

01:03:48.346 --> 01:03:50.723
- Everything's covered in Korea.
- Of course.

01:03:50.807 --> 01:03:53.893
It's covered as part of scar recovery.

01:03:53.977 --> 01:03:57.480
Just get a few more treatments
that I recommend,

01:03:57.772 --> 01:03:59.566
and I'll give you

01:03:59.649 --> 01:04:01.609
the doctor's note and surgical record.

01:04:01.693 --> 01:04:05.447
Gosh, you're incredible.

01:04:05.905 --> 01:04:07.490
You were sent by a friend,

01:04:07.574 --> 01:04:08.825
so of course I'll treat you well.

01:04:09.242 --> 01:04:10.535
Oh, then...

01:04:10.618 --> 01:04:12.912
I also brought my guys along.

01:04:12.996 --> 01:04:15.457
Do you mind looking at them, too?

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:16.458
Perfect.

01:04:16.541 --> 01:04:18.084
I mean, I'll do a perfect job.

01:04:18.626 --> 01:04:20.753
Bring them right in.

01:04:21.254 --> 01:04:22.589
Guys, come in!

01:04:23.756 --> 01:04:24.966
Hello, Doctor!

01:04:25.049 --> 01:04:28.052
- Hello, welcome.
- Hi.

01:04:28.136 --> 01:04:32.098
I'm Choi Kang from the SIU Unit
at Veotigo Insurance.

01:04:32.974 --> 01:04:37.687
We have a few things to confirm
regarding a few insurance claims made.

01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:39.814
We're just here for a site visit.

01:04:40.148 --> 01:04:42.901
Please keep the doctor's notes,
surgical records, appointment records,

01:04:42.984 --> 01:04:45.695
the original accounting ledgers,
and security camera footage

01:04:45.778 --> 01:04:47.489
for the time being.

01:04:47.572 --> 01:04:51.409
And we'd like to take
a short statement from you.

01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:59.709
I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:04:59.792 --> 01:05:02.337
Come on, Doctor, you know it all.

01:05:03.129 --> 01:05:05.632
Come on, Doctor. You know what it's about.

01:05:06.674 --> 01:05:10.220
Help them out, all right?

01:05:31.908 --> 01:05:33.993

01:05:46.005 --> 01:05:49.551
- You're incredible.
- Hey, boss!

01:05:49.634 --> 01:05:51.010
How did it go?

01:05:51.636 --> 01:05:55.014
Who am I? The ace of Veotigo.

01:05:55.098 --> 01:05:56.891
I took care of it perfectly.

01:05:57.517 --> 01:05:58.351
Really?

01:05:58.434 --> 01:06:00.812
Kang has some insane connections.

01:06:00.895 --> 01:06:04.148
He has an adorable yet terrifying friend.

01:06:04.941 --> 01:06:06.484
It's not just the connections.

01:06:06.568 --> 01:06:09.153
He really is just insane.

01:06:09.237 --> 01:06:11.281
- Right?
- You, too!

01:06:14.492 --> 01:06:16.536
How about a drink tonight? My treat.

01:06:16.869 --> 01:06:18.663
Not today. I have a housewarming party.

01:06:18.871 --> 01:06:20.373
A housewarming party?

01:06:20.456 --> 01:06:21.332
Did you move again?

01:06:21.624 --> 01:06:22.917
Hold on.

01:06:23.001 --> 01:06:24.877
I'd better go to the ATM
and get some cash.

01:06:24.961 --> 01:06:26.004
For Do-yeon.

01:06:26.087 --> 01:06:27.922
I'm busy tonight, though.

01:06:28.006 --> 01:06:29.299
What are you talking about?

01:06:29.382 --> 01:06:32.093
It's for my neighbors tonight, not you.

01:06:32.176 --> 01:06:35.305
You should have just said so
from the beginning.

01:06:35.388 --> 01:06:38.850
Are you playing favorites
between work and your neighbors?

01:06:38.933 --> 01:06:41.227
I already invited you guys once.
Give me a break.

01:06:41.853 --> 01:06:43.229
Let's just grab some lunch.

01:06:43.313 --> 01:06:44.647
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

01:06:44.731 --> 01:06:46.608
Not that Chinese place again, though.

01:06:46.691 --> 01:06:48.901
We just ate! Why are we eating again?

01:06:48.985 --> 01:06:50.570
Let's just keep eating, all right?

01:06:50.653 --> 01:06:51.904
Keep eating?

01:06:51.988 --> 01:06:54.282
See? You're insane!

01:06:59.037 --> 01:07:00.538
This smells incredible.

01:07:00.955 --> 01:07:02.290
- It's delicious.
- Here you go.

01:07:02.373 --> 01:07:04.792
- Here it is!
- Yes!

01:07:05.501 --> 01:07:07.503
You didn't have to cook so much for us!

01:07:08.504 --> 01:07:09.505
She cooked a feast.

01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:13.134
Your cooking is even better
than what people say.

01:07:13.217 --> 01:07:15.178
Everything is delicious.

01:07:15.261 --> 01:07:18.306
The side dishes from your wife
and Nam-yeon are just as amazing.

01:07:18.389 --> 01:07:20.266
Oh, don't give me that.

01:07:20.350 --> 01:07:22.477
They only taste good
because we're eating together.

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:23.936
Do-yeon, try this too.

01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:24.854
Open up.

01:07:25.897 --> 01:07:26.814
Good girl.

01:07:26.898 --> 01:07:29.692
- Thank you, Uncle.
- Have some water, too.

01:07:29.817 --> 01:07:30.818
Okay.

01:07:32.236 --> 01:07:34.072
Get married and have a kid already.

01:07:34.155 --> 01:07:36.366
That's not just up to me, is it?

01:07:36.449 --> 01:07:37.909
- That's true.
- He can't get married.

01:07:37.992 --> 01:07:39.577
- There's no way.
- Impossible.

01:07:41.245 --> 01:07:42.330
Yong-hui,

01:07:42.413 --> 01:07:44.082
stop stuffing your face
and join the conversation.

01:07:44.165 --> 01:07:45.958
You guys can do all the talking.

01:07:46.042 --> 01:07:47.126
I'll just eat.

01:07:47.210 --> 01:07:48.294
Mi-gyeong,

01:07:48.378 --> 01:07:50.296
can I have another bowl after this?

01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:51.214
Of course.

01:07:52.298 --> 01:07:54.133
This is so nice.

01:07:54.717 --> 01:07:57.428
Let's all have dinner
at our place next time.

01:07:57.512 --> 01:07:59.806
I'll make some delicious
spicy braised chicken.

01:07:59.889 --> 01:08:02.392
- That's awesome!
- I'd love that.

01:08:02.475 --> 01:08:05.645
Let's invite Myeong-o and his mom, too.

01:08:11.901 --> 01:08:15.697
Then let's have dinner
at our place next time.

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:17.323
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

01:08:17.407 --> 01:08:20.159
Nobody makes spicy braised chicken
like Hui-ja.

01:08:20.243 --> 01:08:22.245
- That's true.
- It's the best.

01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:24.872
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

01:08:30.294 --> 01:08:31.170
Oh, wow.

01:08:31.254 --> 01:08:33.256
KIYUN-SI, OFFICIAL URBAN CONVERGENCE
SPECIALIZED ZONE

01:08:33.339 --> 01:08:34.507
Can't believe that's gotten approved.

01:08:35.216 --> 01:08:37.969
I get calls nonstop these days.

01:08:38.428 --> 01:08:40.763
Everyone is calling,
asking me to sell my land to them.

01:08:41.347 --> 01:08:43.266
What? You own land?

01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:45.685
You know the field
on the way to the gas station?

01:08:45.768 --> 01:08:47.603
- All of that's his land.
- What?

01:08:47.687 --> 01:08:50.064
And you tell me now?
I spent a fortune on our gears!

01:08:50.148 --> 01:08:52.066
No, it's not worth that much.

01:08:53.067 --> 01:08:55.027
Sir!

01:08:55.111 --> 01:08:56.946
Please let me pour you one.

01:08:57.029 --> 01:08:59.157
Do you not own any land, little one?

01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:00.491
Of course not!

01:09:00.575 --> 01:09:02.201
You're a landless loser, I see.

01:09:02.785 --> 01:09:04.704
A landless loser?

01:09:04.787 --> 01:09:06.789
You want me to pour this on your head?

01:09:06.873 --> 01:09:09.292
- You guys are such kids.
- What do you mean?

01:09:09.375 --> 01:09:11.043
Anyway, good work, everyone.

01:09:11.127 --> 01:09:13.337
- Good work.
- Great job.

01:09:18.593 --> 01:09:21.596
I just don't want to see
Changri-dong on the news anymore.

01:09:21.971 --> 01:09:23.222
I know.

01:09:24.056 --> 01:09:25.767
Something like this
won't happen again, right?

01:09:26.768 --> 01:09:28.227
Of course not.

01:09:28.603 --> 01:09:30.980
Isn't that right,
secret agent of Changri-dong?

01:09:31.314 --> 01:09:32.607
Come on.

01:09:32.690 --> 01:09:33.524
What?

01:09:35.359 --> 01:09:36.194
Jeez.

01:09:36.277 --> 01:09:39.197
Those cars need to stop using
high beams around here.

01:09:39.864 --> 01:09:41.908
- Let me pour you some more.
- Yeah.

01:09:41.991 --> 01:09:43.159
Hey, where's Su-il?

01:09:43.242 --> 01:09:44.410
- Home.
- Thank you.

01:09:44.494 --> 01:09:45.495
And he's not bummed?

01:09:45.578 --> 01:09:47.705
No, he's not.
He needs to stop drinking, anyway.

01:09:47.789 --> 01:09:48.623
Hey--

01:09:55.797 --> 01:09:56.631
What was that?

01:10:12.814 --> 01:10:14.023
HEROES NEXT DOOR

01:10:24.575 --> 01:10:30.581
HEROES NEXT DOOR

01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:50.017
SPECIAL THANKS TO JEONG SOON-WON
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

01:11:11.122 --> 01:11:14.041
HEROES NEXT DOOR

01:12:08.179 --> 01:12:12.683
THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO HAS SUPPORTED
HEROES NEXT DOOR

01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:18.314
