Who says I can't be a good wife?

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:50.490
Not likely.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.760
Why not likely?

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.440
Gentle,

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:55.760
cute,

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.440
virtuous,

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.110
and understanding.

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.630
This person you're describing—

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.350
do I know her?

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.720
Even prone to violence.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.230
Don't go causing trouble for other people.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.579
I won't cause trouble for others.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.440
I'll only cause trouble for you.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.500
Are you really not going to sleep?

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.190
I do need to sleep.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.830
I heard the New Year atmosphere
is quite strong here.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.150
I'm planning to go walk around
the streets tomorrow.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.280
Want to come with me?

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.370
We'll talk about it after you wake up.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.790
I can't wake up on my own.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.800
You'll have to wake me up.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.480
Jin Zhao.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.840
Can you tell me about things

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.790
from when we were little?

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.720
I've forgotten a lot of it already.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.080
What do you want to hear?

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.480
I want to know

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.670
why Mom and Dad

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.440
got divorced.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.550
I know they were always arguing,

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.640
but what exactly

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.840
caused the divorce in the end?

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.280
Because of a few potted plants, I think.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.500
Potted plants?

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:06.940
Jin Qiang broke a few of

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.750
Jiang Yinghan's favorite potted plants.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.670
Jin Qiang!

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.380
-Love to keep them, huh?
-No!

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.920
The house is so small,

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.280
and you're cluttering it with
all this useless stuff!

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:51.750
Remember:

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.190
as a man, you should be responsible.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.070
When faced with problems and difficulties,

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.330
you need to solve them,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.480
not avoid or run away

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.870
from them,

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.060
because that's the ultimate sign
of cowardice.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.870
Got it.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.850
And what happened next?

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.040
Didn't Dad buy Mom new ones?

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.790
No.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.480
Jin Qiang thought
they were just some potted plants,

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.580
not a big deal.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.350
But Jiang Yinghan felt

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.410
they were the most important things.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.390
She never got an apology from Jin Qiang,

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.430
so she was very angry.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.080
So they got divorced over that?

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.310
After a woman and a man

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.040
go through testing each other,

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.840
friction,

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.670
adjustment,

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.810
and all kinds of hardships
before finally coming together,

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.960
yet they can divorce over

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.070
just a few potted plants.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.810
Does that mean marriage itself

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.310
is inherently unhappy?

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.960
There's no such thing as
an unhappy marriage,

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.640
but there are indeed unhappy couples.

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:41.230
It's not marriage
that brings disaster upon them—

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.400
it's that they themselves
are not steadfast enough.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.710
As long as two people truly
love each other,

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.770
they can overcome all difficulties.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.430
Where there's a will, there's a way.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.190
Zhao.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:05.400
I think

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.720
you'll definitely be
a good husband in the future.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.160
Whether I'm a good husband or not

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.660
is for my wife to judge.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.120
So when do you

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.160
plan to get married?

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.760
I've never thought about it.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:39.040
I remember...

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.070
I remember one time

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.730
when I was at home,

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.670
I saw Mom and Dad

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:47.310
arguing for some reason.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.260
I was really scared and hid under the bed,

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.070
but you just kept doing your homework.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:53.240
I was so mad.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.430
When was that?

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.210
When I was in second grade
and you were in junior high.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:04.960
And then?

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.240
Then...

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.400
Then

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.040
I started reading a storybook
under the bed

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.770
and accidentally fell asleep.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:19.050
After I woke up,
I didn't tell you about it

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.920
because I was worried
you'd find out and scold me.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:25.890
Scold you for what?

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:30.630
What else could it be?

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.310
Wouldn't be anything nice,
that's for sure.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.120
You'd definitely think
I was too naughty

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.580
and that it was dangerous.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.490
Truly precocious for your age.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.760
I told you, I'm not little anymore.

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:50.160
Yeah,

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:52.790
funny how someone just said

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.450
they were little a moment ago.

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:57.830
Anyway, in my eyes,

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.000
you're like Sun Wukong's disciple—

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.950
sometimes big, sometimes small.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.080
Where are you going?

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:05.000
I'm not leaving.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.970
I didn't expect my mind
would be completely filled with her.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:47.920
I had imagined countless times

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:50.190
what she would look like when she grew up—

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:51.530
every version still carrying

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.660
a trace of cuteness and childishness.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.260
Yet I never once imagined

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:57.240
that she, who in my memories

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:59.190
was always a child,

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.170

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.430
The other day, there was a Panamera
parked outside your building.

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:19.640
That license plate

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:21.870
looked really familiar.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:23.190
Familiar?

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.430
Are you sure you didn't see it wrong?

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.040
The circle's not that big,

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.020
and that car is easy to recognize.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:30.880
What,

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.000
so you've changed

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.760
your type?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.730
Are you into married women now?

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.640
You didn't bring this up two days ago—

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.970
why mention it only now?

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.790
Just tell me what you're
trying to pull this time.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:49.750
The stuff you filmed last time—

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.240
when do you plan

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:56.270
to send it over?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:57.850
You're acting like

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.920
a mistress deliberately trying to
get caught by the wife.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.400
I'm just bored,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.530
waiting for the wife to come out
so I can PK her.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.520
Fine.

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:09.640
I've sent it over as you requested.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.010
Forget about the Panamera, alright?

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:14.880
What's the rush?

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:55.710
You've got nothing better to do?

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:56.770
This was just made.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.120
Tastes good. Try some.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:00.710
Put it away.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.730
Just looking at the cream
makes me feel sick.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.240
Are you mad?

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:07.670
Stay away from her.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.470
What I'm interested in

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:11.640
has never been her.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.240
Then what do you want?

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.310
You hate cream—

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.000
so what do you like to eat?

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:22.710
I like seafood.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.380
Want to go have a fight in the sea?

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.520
But someone could get killed.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.520
Aren't you pretty good at fighting?

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.790
But I can't swim.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:33.640
Then stay away from her.

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:35.610
If you ever get near her again,

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:37.070
I'll kick you into the sea.

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:38.400
Don't rush.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.710
I have something for you.

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.400
I specially asked someone
to bring it back from Japan.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:43.830
Hold on.

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:44.630
Don't bother.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:45.790
I don't need it.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:51.270
Let's have a race.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:54.850
Not interested.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.530
I heard that Jiang Mu

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.150
will perform at a charity show

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.190
with Nana tonight.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:04.230
Let's make the entertainment center
the finishing line.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.160
Whoever gets there first
celebrates with her;

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:08.800
and whoever arrives later

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:11.400
stays out of her life and never shows up
in front of her again.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.530
How does that sound?

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:17.710
She's a very interesting girl.

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:19.430
You like her?

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.550
Get in the car.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.880
Put on your earphones and don't hang up.

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.090
Any other rules?
Say them all at once.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.360
No, that's all.

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:28.510
Want me to wait for you?

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:29.640
No need.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.090
You go first.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.880
The red light lasts for tens of seconds.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.680
If I don't wait for you,
it feels like an unfair win.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:36.910
Only if you beat me

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:40.320
will you have a chance to talk about
whether it's fair or not.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.190
Anyway,

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:44.030
your driving skills are quite good.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:44.840
Just average.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.750
I'm just driving for fun.

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:48.670
You're better with words.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.720
Don't you understand sarcasm?

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.600
So if I win,

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.270
you'll accept defeat nicely, right?

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:01.330
Three minutes ago,

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:03.990
you had the chance to state the rules.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.320
Your start was faster than I expected.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.600
You have even more OEM parts
than I thought.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.730
It could be lighter.

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.950
Then how would you
deal with the counterweight?

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:32.030
I don't work for you.

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.600
I can pay you.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.060
But I don't sell.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.640
My HP is 500. What about you?

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:50.270
600.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.270
A Wankel engine

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:53.160
can reach up to 650 HP.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.230
If you had increased
your turbo boost a bit,

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:58.460
overtaking just now would've been easier.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.430
The factory setting is 0.5,

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:00.430
and now it's 0.8.

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.270
It could be increased to 1.0.

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.500
It's enough as it is.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.690
Are those your people?

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:11.170
Have you played Klotski?

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.490
A game for 3-year-olds.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.470
Your Wankel engine has more HP

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.370
and your car is lighter.

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:43.920
If we're talking pure performance,
I'm bound to lose.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.920
I'm just racing with a twin-rotor engine
at top speed.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.120
Why are you so fixated on rotors?

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.920
Guess why I won't buy your parts?

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.190
They're not available in Manshi,
and you won't take imports either.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.920
Don't tell me

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:56.030
you're going to hand-make one by yourself.

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:57.890
That's exactly what I had in mind.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.840
Then I'll wait and see.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:36.640
Your brakes are very responsive.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.610
Did you modify them yourself?

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:38.210
Yes.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.860
I upgraded my brake discs,

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.230
and I modified the calipers too.

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.760
So where am I falling short?

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.880
Your suspension is too soft.
It can't hold up,

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:45.640
and that causes a chain reaction.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.500
Anything else?

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.470
The intake valve is loose,
and the coilovers

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:50.600
and piston calipers are all replicas.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.800
This isn't the optimal setup.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.200
You've never driven it—how would you know?

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.290
I can hear it.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.620
I underestimated you.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.670
That night before taking the corner,

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:15.870
why didn't you turn on your headlights?

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.030
Racing cars, underground fighting.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.700
Do you own that Chinese restaurant too?

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.860
Who's that drunk man who's always there?

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:28.510
How long have you been into racing?

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.470
Why haven't I seen you in Manshi before?

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:32.000
You have so many questions.

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:34.600
Then why aren't you answering them?

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:35.950
Why are you

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.700
so interested in my business?

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.990
Taking corners fast
is what makes you truly fast.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:48.950
Step on the gas pedal
immediately after the turn

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:50.360
to exit the turn faster.

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:54.530
How about this?

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:56.470
From now on, I'll lead—

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.730
will you follow?

00:22:58.030 --> 00:22:58.920
Sure.

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:10.800
You did that on purpose.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.460
I didn't plant those flowers.

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:15.880
Turn off your navigation

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.600
and stay close behind me.

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.040
You're not setting me up, are you?

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.040
What do you think?

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.850
Ma'am, I'm heading back first.

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:31.000
Zhao! Driving really fast today, huh?

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.800
I believe you did this on purpose
this time.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:40.990
I told you to stay close.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:42.590
It was you who didn't keep up.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.540
You need to be so skilled

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:04.750
that your hands
move faster than your brain,

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:06.470
making all your movements

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.400
become muscle memory

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:11.090
and every decision and action

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:12.930
happen instinctively.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.030
Are you crazy?

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:54.230
Do you think this is a racetrack?

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:56.920
Not respecting your own
and others' safety—

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.750
you've insulted the sport of racing.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:59.880
I was being foolish.

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:02.990
I lost my sense of proportion
in the heat of the moment.

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:05.670
I shouldn't have treated public roads
as racetracks.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:06.930
You taught me a lesson.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.680
I'm leaving. Won't wait for you.

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:12.320
One last question.

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:15.110
Shoot.

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:17.090
Want to come with me to France?

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:18.920
Join my racing team.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.080
Next month, let's compete together

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:23.360
in the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:27.640
No thanks.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.230
Once I'm done with what I have on hand,

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:31.230
I'll quit racing.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.650
So what do you plan to do?

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:58.790

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:01.190

Bravo!

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:17.750
Mu.

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:20.080
You're so cool playing the drums.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.190
It's nothing.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.880
Come on, show us your trump card.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.330
Sing a classic song

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.560
and blow their minds.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.080
But Jin Zhao hasn't arrived yet.

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:32.670
I want to sing this song for him.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.920
He's not here yet?

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.120
That's weird.

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:38.440
Sui talked to him today,

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.620
and he asked about
our time and location tonight.

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.050
I thought he was coming.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.450
Maybe he's still busy with something.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:07.040
Now you can sing, right?

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:09.840
Come on.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:13.530
Next up,

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.920
my good friend Jiang Mu

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.080
will perform

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:20.070
"The Moon Represents My Heart."

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:38.730

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:25.670
New Year's right around the corner.

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:29.510
Is it?

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.490
It's New Year's Eve in a couple of days.

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:34.230
How did you

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.420
usually spend New Year's Eve before?

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:40.160
I forgot.

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:42.810
It never crossed my mind before,

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.560
so I never celebrated it.

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:48.360
What about this year?

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.820
How do you plan to spend it?

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:55.850
What about you?

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:58.390
Do you have any ideas?

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:01.960
I heard from Sanlai

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:05.260
that Manshi streets have a really
festive New Year atmosphere.

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.630
There are temple fairs
and dragon and lion dances.

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:08.690
Have you seen them?

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.080
You want to go see?

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:21.060
What kind of New Year gift would you like?

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:22.780
What about you?

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:25.240
What New Year gift do you want?

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:27.200
If I tell you, will you give it to me?

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:32.270
I can't get the moon from the sky,

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:33.950
but anything else,

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:35.690
I'll try my best to get for you.

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.940
I don't want the moon from the sky.

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:41.830
I'm already the moon myself.

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:11.650
I'll go look at the waves.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.840
My New Year's wish is

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:24.840
that the person in my heart

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:26.550
can understand my songs,

00:34:26.949 --> 00:34:28.510
understand my feelings,

00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:30.550
and keep me in his heart

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.670
as his moon for a lifetime!

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:33.920
What did you say?

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.070
The wind is too strong,
and I couldn't hear clearly.

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:37.920
I was singing.

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:39.030
Didn't you hear me?

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:42.690
I'll sing again then!

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.800
The sea at night is also beautiful.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:42.590

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:48.200

It's getting late.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.930
We should head back.

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:24.110
I heard there's a meteor shower tonight.

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:25.360
Let's wait and see.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.510
Please.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.510
Remember last time
we watched the Orionids?

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:39.240
You brought me here to see them.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.320
Back then, you couldn't
even tell directions.

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:44.360
It's different now.

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:46.550
I've fallen in love with astronomy.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.520
Those meteor showers

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:50.150
are a piece of cake for me now.

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:52.000
Have you heard?

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:53.280
If you make wishes to meteor showers,

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.140
they're more likely to come true.

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.240
What's your wish?

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:02.880
Never thought about it.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.860
You must have many wishes.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.760
How do you know?

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:14.510
What's your wish?

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:17.360

How do you know Zhang Fan?

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.200
The guy who stood on your left yesterday.

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.590
He's not a good person.

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:08.950
He's a bad guy. Stay away from him.

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:11.200
How's he a bad guy?

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.240
He loafs around all day

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:14.340
and never does anything serious.

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.960
You can tell at a glance
he won't get into college.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.840
He's been in this foundation course
for 3 years—

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.640
he's basically a street guy now.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:26.820
Where's the money?

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.810
If you're late with it again next time,

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:34.840
you're dead.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.630
You know him?

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:38.950
Yes.

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:40.600
Let's go.

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:41.510
Take me to him.

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:42.280
Mu!

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.510
Hey, Mu, you really can't go!

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:45.430
He's a street guy.

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:47.830
Why would you want to
get involved with him?

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.510
You go.

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:52.420
Me?

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:02.870
Leave it to me.

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.400
Someone's looking for you outside.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:27.680
Can't you see I'm sleeping?

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:29.200
Who is it?

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:44.800
Oh, it's you.

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:46.200
Do you know Jin...

00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:49.050
I mean, do you know Brandy?

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:51.470
Yes, I do.

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:52.990
What's up?

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:54.920
Are you close?

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.260
My brother is pretty close with Brandy.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.340
Your brother?

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.450
Who's your brother?

00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:04.570
Why are you asking so many questions?

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.920
What's your relationship with Brandy?

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:09.840
I'm...

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:11.990
I'm his tenant.

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:13.320
Well...

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:15.550
What was in that package

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:17.550
you gave to Brandy yesterday?

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:18.740
Blueprints.

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:22.240
My brother asked me to give them
to Brandy.

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:22.970
Blueprints?

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.840
They were

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.400
complete structural blueprints of a car.

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:32.920
Blueprints?

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:34.330
You... You...

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:36.320
So who's your brother?

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:39.910
An automotive engineer.

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:41.470
He works at a car factory.

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:42.840
Why are you asking so much?

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:43.470
What,

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:45.900
you want to get to know my brother too?

00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:49.240
I don't.

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:50.510
Thanks.

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:53.750
So many pointless questions.

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.040
Hey, how can you be so shameless?

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:01.360
Mu, are you okay? Did he scare you?

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:03.840
Do you know Seventh Day?

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.150
Sure I do.

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:07.180
Back then, when it was my grandpa's
seventh day after passing,

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:09.240
our whole family kept vigil. This...

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:10.300
What's wrong, Mu?

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:11.200
Mu?

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:26.290
Did Zhang Fan give you these blueprints?

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:31.380
You know Zhang Fan?

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:33.360
Of course. He's from my school.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.070
I'm not a nerd.

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:37.410
I know a lot more than you think, okay?

00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:40.760
Concerned?

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:44.310
Who's concerned?

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:49.760
I have to leave tomorrow.

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:51.950
What's so urgent?

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:52.930
It's about the car.
