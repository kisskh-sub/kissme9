HEROES NEXT DOOR

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:43.106
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PROFESSIONS, PLACES,

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.107
COMPANIES, ORGANIZATIONS,
ETHNIC GROUPS AND EVENTS ARE NOT REAL.

00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:45.108
ALL CHILD AND ANIMAL SCENES WERE FILMED
SAFELY UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION.

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:54.951
I'll be on my own.

00:00:55.452 --> 00:00:56.745
I have somewhere to go.

00:01:00.415 --> 00:01:04.169
Do you think you're the main dish
while the rest of us are sides?

00:01:04.252 --> 00:01:07.714
You know, a main dish can only shine
when the sides do the work.

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:15.847
What, are you immortal?

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:17.683
You're going to save everyone on your own?

00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.559
You're delusional.

00:01:26.983 --> 00:01:28.485
And what would you do?

00:01:28.985 --> 00:01:30.195
Swoop in like a real hero.

00:01:41.873 --> 00:01:45.585
CHANGRI CHURCH

00:01:58.974 --> 00:02:00.016
Kang.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.443
Stay back.

00:02:11.903 --> 00:02:13.196
Stay back!

00:03:00.786 --> 00:03:02.120
Byeong-nam.

00:03:02.204 --> 00:03:03.163
Byeong-nam!

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:08.627
Byeong-nam.

00:03:09.377 --> 00:03:10.545
Byeong-nam.

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:11.546
Byeong-nam...

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:20.222
Byeong-nam!

00:03:20.597 --> 00:03:21.431
Byeong-nam.

00:03:25.185 --> 00:03:26.061
Byeong-nam!

00:03:28.647 --> 00:03:29.606
Byeong-nam...

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:35.278
Are you okay, Byeong-nam?

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:43.245
Hey.

00:03:45.288 --> 00:03:47.207
I saved the main dish.

00:03:48.834 --> 00:03:49.876
What?

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.213
The side dish saved

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:56.299
the main dish.

00:04:01.346 --> 00:04:02.639
For god's sake...

00:04:06.351 --> 00:04:07.561
Fine.

00:04:08.186 --> 00:04:11.606
You can be anything you want,
the main, the side, or the dessert.

00:04:12.816 --> 00:04:14.025
Seriously...

00:04:18.572 --> 00:04:19.823
Let's get out of here.

00:04:19.906 --> 00:04:21.241
What's wrong?

00:04:21.533 --> 00:04:23.910
- That hurts. I told you it hurts!
- It hurts?

00:04:27.914 --> 00:04:30.584
Why does my head hurt so much?

00:04:32.252 --> 00:04:34.421
All right, then.

00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:36.965
I'm the main dish from now on.

00:04:37.048 --> 00:04:37.966
Hey!

00:04:38.675 --> 00:04:40.260
What was that thing covering you?

00:04:40.343 --> 00:04:41.803
Just something I made.

00:04:50.645 --> 00:04:55.317
A WHISTLE FOR THE BAD GUY

00:04:56.401 --> 00:04:58.612
SAFE GAS STATION

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.157
Two bombs exploded,

00:05:02.324 --> 00:05:04.701
but the news only covered
the phone explosion.

00:05:05.577 --> 00:05:06.870
They put an embargo on it.

00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:09.539
So the higher-ups know everything?

00:05:11.041 --> 00:05:15.170
This involves the Minister, the Speaker,
and corruption in defense,

00:05:15.712 --> 00:05:17.339
so they're being extra cautious.

00:05:18.548 --> 00:05:19.966
Nobody will care about the bombs

00:05:20.634 --> 00:05:24.012
once the corruption
in the top brass comes to light.

00:05:26.473 --> 00:05:27.974
And Sullivan must know that.

00:05:29.434 --> 00:05:31.269
It's the anniversary of Charlotte's death
in three days.

00:05:31.978 --> 00:05:33.480
He may have failed today,

00:05:34.397 --> 00:05:35.899
but he must've planned more.

00:05:41.446 --> 00:05:43.073
Why are you back in your clothes already?

00:05:43.156 --> 00:05:45.116
Hey, come on.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.077
I'm not dying or anything.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.119
Who says you are?

00:05:48.203 --> 00:05:50.246
Just rest when you can.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.666
Yeah, just rest for a few days.

00:05:53.792 --> 00:05:55.794
I'm really fine.

00:05:56.878 --> 00:05:58.129
What about the store?

00:05:58.672 --> 00:06:00.423
Who cares about the store right now?

00:06:00.507 --> 00:06:03.009
I care, of course.

00:06:03.093 --> 00:06:05.053
Are you sure you took care of everything?

00:06:11.142 --> 00:06:12.686
This is from Ms. Na.

00:06:17.941 --> 00:06:19.025
So heavy.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.903
How are you?

00:06:24.197 --> 00:06:27.367
She dislocated her shoulder,
but she's refusing to rest.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.703
I told you I'm fine.

00:06:31.746 --> 00:06:33.623
I'll pay for the hospital bill.

00:06:34.374 --> 00:06:35.333
Rest up.

00:06:36.084 --> 00:06:39.004
An injured bone can haunt you for life
if you don't treat it right.

00:06:39.087 --> 00:06:40.380
We're old now, after all.

00:06:43.049 --> 00:06:44.843
Who says I want you to pay for me?

00:06:45.635 --> 00:06:48.096
I have money and insurance.

00:06:49.556 --> 00:06:50.890
Just let me do this for you, okay?

00:06:54.894 --> 00:06:56.479
I'm alive thanks to you.

00:07:04.988 --> 00:07:05.822
My goodness!

00:07:05.905 --> 00:07:07.032
Oh, stop screaming.

00:07:10.201 --> 00:07:11.369
I want to thank you.

00:07:13.788 --> 00:07:14.914
Whatever.

00:07:16.166 --> 00:07:17.500
As long as you're not hurt.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.548
KIYUN HOSPITAL

00:07:34.601 --> 00:07:37.145
Did the other bomb explode as well?

00:07:40.148 --> 00:07:41.524
That crazy bastard.

00:07:42.734 --> 00:07:44.694
He really tried to kill me.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.113
But you're alive.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.160
Since you're still alive,
Sullivan's not done yet.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.081
What do we do now?

00:07:57.373 --> 00:07:59.167
Ask the police for personal protection

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.544
and stay low for a while.

00:08:06.883 --> 00:08:09.219
He can't just leave like that.

00:08:11.054 --> 00:08:13.223
Who makes their bed
when leaving the hospital?

00:08:13.306 --> 00:08:15.642
I have to leave it spotless.

00:08:15.725 --> 00:08:17.602
- Are you leaving already?
- Hey.

00:08:18.103 --> 00:08:21.606
You know my family loves to leave
as soon as we're hospitalized.

00:08:21.689 --> 00:08:23.817
No need to take up a hospital bed
when I'm fine.

00:08:24.651 --> 00:08:26.027
How about you? Are you okay?

00:08:26.361 --> 00:08:28.446
Yeah, as you can see, I'm fine.

00:08:28.696 --> 00:08:30.740
How's Byeong-nam?

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:39.124
So I climbed the stairs
three steps at a time

00:08:39.207 --> 00:08:40.542
and spotted Kang.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.335
So what happened?

00:08:42.418 --> 00:08:44.671
As soon as I saw the bomb,

00:08:44.754 --> 00:08:49.008
I basically teleported to it...

00:08:49.092 --> 00:08:51.803
- You basically flew!
- I did!

00:08:51.886 --> 00:08:53.513
But Kang saw me and yelled,

00:08:53.596 --> 00:08:56.307
"Byeong-nam. Stay back!"

00:08:56.599 --> 00:09:00.562
That's when I knew I had to save him.

00:09:00.645 --> 00:09:02.480
It was the only thing on my mind.

00:09:02.897 --> 00:09:04.899
Chun-bae, you know my special move.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.526
Your special move?

00:09:06.609 --> 00:09:08.611
The dropkick that you always talk about?

00:09:08.945 --> 00:09:11.239
It's not just any dropkick.

00:09:11.322 --> 00:09:12.991
It's legendary.

00:09:14.993 --> 00:09:16.619
It was back in 2003

00:09:17.412 --> 00:09:19.914
when that legendary dropkick
almost became a lost skill

00:09:19.998 --> 00:09:21.541
due to my injury from a military mission.

00:09:21.624 --> 00:09:24.085
I unleashed that dropkick with full force

00:09:24.169 --> 00:09:25.128
and saved Kang.

00:09:25.211 --> 00:09:28.756
Then I quickly took out my shield
from my backpack

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.842
- when the bomb went, "Bang!"
- "Bang!"

00:09:30.925 --> 00:09:32.552
I landed with a perfect breakfall.

00:09:32.635 --> 00:09:34.012
A breakfall! What happened next?

00:09:34.387 --> 00:09:39.517
Then I comforted Kang,
who was shivering in fear,

00:09:39.601 --> 00:09:41.102
and came to the hospital with him.

00:09:41.644 --> 00:09:44.230
Kang isn't the type to get scared, is he?

00:09:44.314 --> 00:09:47.609
I just know you'll yap about this
for the next ten years.

00:09:47.692 --> 00:09:48.735
I'm not exaggerating!

00:09:48.818 --> 00:09:50.361
Where's Ms. Jung, by the way?

00:09:50.445 --> 00:09:54.282
Su-il tried to stop her,
but she insisted on going home.

00:09:54.365 --> 00:09:56.409
Man, she's so stubborn.

00:09:56.492 --> 00:09:58.328
I have to see her before she leaves.

00:09:58.411 --> 00:09:59.787
- See you later.
- Bye.

00:09:59.871 --> 00:10:01.915
- See you.
- Take care!

00:10:01.998 --> 00:10:03.291
- Hey.
- Bye.

00:10:03.374 --> 00:10:06.252
I'll show you
the legendary dropkick next time.

00:10:07.003 --> 00:10:08.004
Mr. Kwak.

00:10:08.087 --> 00:10:09.756
Oh, hello, Doctor.

00:10:10.423 --> 00:10:11.299
How do you feel?

00:10:11.966 --> 00:10:13.968
Here's the thing, Doctor.

00:10:14.385 --> 00:10:16.429
I think some of the shards got to me.

00:10:16.512 --> 00:10:18.640
I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

00:10:18.723 --> 00:10:21.768
And my wrist is a bit sore

00:10:21.851 --> 00:10:23.895
from my powerful breakfall.

00:10:24.896 --> 00:10:28.066
I think what happened is

00:10:28.316 --> 00:10:30.735
that you had your fists up like this
in fear of the explosion,

00:10:30.818 --> 00:10:33.529
that you hit your own head.

00:10:33.613 --> 00:10:36.324
The punch was so strong
that you got a wrist fracture.

00:10:38.034 --> 00:10:40.828
Oh, so the shock from the explosion

00:10:40.912 --> 00:10:43.289
made me hit my head like this?

00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:45.833
I basically just punched my own head?

00:10:45.917 --> 00:10:47.502
Yes, basically.

00:10:48.044 --> 00:10:50.880
Your headache should be gone soon
with some pills.

00:10:50.964 --> 00:10:52.048
- Really?
- Yes.

00:10:52.423 --> 00:10:54.008
- Get some rest.
- Thank you.

00:10:56.219 --> 00:10:58.179
How did I...

00:10:59.597 --> 00:11:01.307
I hit my own head?

00:11:04.852 --> 00:11:07.230
Hey, you heard the doctor, right?

00:11:07.313 --> 00:11:09.983
I have a headache and a twisted wrist

00:11:10.066 --> 00:11:12.443
from the shock of that explosion.

00:11:12.527 --> 00:11:15.071
So you hit your head like this
and passed out.

00:11:16.447 --> 00:11:18.199
What are you talking about?

00:11:18.283 --> 00:11:20.118
You know how dangerous it was.

00:11:20.576 --> 00:11:23.121
- Fine.
- Come on.

00:11:23.496 --> 00:11:26.332
By the way, are you okay?

00:11:27.083 --> 00:11:27.917
Yeah.

00:11:32.046 --> 00:11:33.464
Why do you look so glum?

00:11:33.548 --> 00:11:35.049
I'm the one who got hurt.

00:11:37.218 --> 00:11:38.970
I just feel like this isn't the end.

00:11:39.053 --> 00:11:40.179
What do you mean?

00:11:41.973 --> 00:11:43.975
There seem to be more bombs coming.

00:11:58.656 --> 00:12:01.409
- She's out!
- Here she is.

00:12:03.328 --> 00:12:04.912
She'll issue a statement later.

00:12:06.247 --> 00:12:08.458
Excuse me. She'll issue a statement later.

00:12:10.835 --> 00:12:12.086
It's the woman from earlier!

00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:15.340
It's the woman who kicked the phone!

00:12:16.215 --> 00:12:17.675
How did you know the phone was a bomb?

00:12:17.759 --> 00:12:19.302
How did you know it would explode?

00:12:19.385 --> 00:12:21.471
Is it true that you defused
the fake bomb from before?

00:12:33.483 --> 00:12:34.859
How do you feel right now?

00:13:00.927 --> 00:13:03.388
LAND PURCHASE AGREEMENT

00:13:08.267 --> 00:13:12.605
TRANSCRIPT OF RECORDING

00:13:14.357 --> 00:13:16.901
You've done a lot of research on me.

00:13:18.277 --> 00:13:20.196
Why are you showing me this?

00:13:23.074 --> 00:13:24.158
Mr. Lee,

00:13:25.201 --> 00:13:26.869
haven't you seen the video?

00:13:26.953 --> 00:13:29.122
I almost died just now.

00:13:29.455 --> 00:13:31.374
Don't you think this is crossing the line?

00:13:34.794 --> 00:13:35.670
Ms. Na.

00:13:36.087 --> 00:13:36.921
What?

00:13:37.713 --> 00:13:40.258
You have the files
on Kim Seok-jun's illegal acts, right?

00:13:43.845 --> 00:13:45.304
What are you talking about?

00:13:46.097 --> 00:13:48.474
You paid to have the Speaker's son
declared innocent

00:13:48.558 --> 00:13:51.436
and were promised to have Kiyun-si
designated as a specialized zone.

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:53.271
Then you and the Minister

00:13:54.772 --> 00:13:56.607
bought land in that area
under borrowed names.

00:13:59.569 --> 00:14:02.113
Give me the files
on Kim Seok-jun's secret land purchases.

00:14:08.744 --> 00:14:09.787
Why should I?

00:14:12.957 --> 00:14:14.208
If you hand that over,

00:14:14.667 --> 00:14:18.504
we'll protect you from Sullivan.

00:14:25.011 --> 00:14:25.845
How?

00:14:29.807 --> 00:14:33.311
This afternoon, at the press conference
by Assemblywoman Na Eun-jae,

00:14:33.394 --> 00:14:35.438
a phone suspected to have been sent

00:14:35.521 --> 00:14:38.816
- by the blackmailer exploded.
- So much dust.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.487
Ms. Na had held this press conference

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.864
to discuss the recent threats
she'd received.

00:14:44.947 --> 00:14:49.160
Thankfully, nobody was harmed
by the explosion.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.370
The police have taken the phone...

00:14:51.454 --> 00:14:53.956
Was this why you told us
to stay in the whole day?

00:14:56.083 --> 00:14:59.045
Yeah, I was going to
tell you in the morning,

00:14:59.128 --> 00:15:00.505
but I wasn't entirely sure yet.

00:15:00.588 --> 00:15:02.757
The surrounding areas
are partially blocked off...

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.051
I didn't get hurt,

00:15:05.134 --> 00:15:07.136
and Byeong-nam only got minor injuries.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.054
It's fine.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:20.274
Can you and Do-yeon stay home for a while?

00:15:21.859 --> 00:15:24.487
So she doesn't go to kindergarten,
and I don't go to work?

00:15:24.737 --> 00:15:25.571
Yeah.

00:15:25.655 --> 00:15:27.573
Please stay home for a couple days.

00:15:29.242 --> 00:15:30.743
Mom!

00:15:30.826 --> 00:15:33.579
Can I bring Pinky
to kindergarten tomorrow?

00:15:33.663 --> 00:15:34.872
No.

00:15:35.331 --> 00:15:36.958
Why not?

00:15:37.041 --> 00:15:39.335
You're both going to be there tomorrow.

00:15:40.253 --> 00:15:42.046
Pinky is our family, too.

00:15:43.089 --> 00:15:45.216
Sorry, Pinky. Mom says no.

00:15:45.591 --> 00:15:47.385
But I'll play with you a lot.

00:15:51.639 --> 00:15:53.224
She's been like that all day.

00:15:53.391 --> 00:15:54.892
"Why can't I go to kindergarten today?"

00:15:54.976 --> 00:15:58.104
"I can't wait until tomorrow
so I can go to the playground."

00:15:59.397 --> 00:16:01.107
I'm fine staying home,

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:03.317
but she'll be bored to death.

00:16:03.609 --> 00:16:04.986
You know your daughter.

00:16:05.444 --> 00:16:07.822
It's a bigger emergency to keep her home.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.075
She has her kindergarten teachers

00:16:11.158 --> 00:16:13.119
and Mr. Lee at Yongmu Gym.

00:16:15.413 --> 00:16:16.622
Don't worry, okay?

00:16:23.087 --> 00:16:24.297
Keep cleaning.

00:16:24.714 --> 00:16:25.548
Oh, right.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.970
- It's so dusty.
- Yeah.

00:16:33.431 --> 00:16:35.933
KIYUN DREAM KINDERGARTEN
Is the open class tomorrow a good idea?

00:16:36.559 --> 00:16:38.019
It's been so chaotic lately.

00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:40.396
The director wants us to go ahead with it.

00:16:41.522 --> 00:16:43.357
There are way too many events this month.

00:16:44.025 --> 00:16:45.818
I'm not even done writing the class notes.

00:16:45.901 --> 00:16:46.986
Me neither.

00:16:48.279 --> 00:16:50.990
Olivia, do you have everything you need?

00:17:16.474 --> 00:17:17.808
No.

00:17:18.434 --> 00:17:20.186
Why not?

00:17:20.269 --> 00:17:23.230
I'm meeting friends today,
and there's a birthday party tomorrow.

00:17:23.314 --> 00:17:24.774
Can I please skip lessons for two days?

00:17:24.857 --> 00:17:25.816
Absolutely not.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.693
I'm picking you up after school.

00:17:27.777 --> 00:17:29.612
Why are you also on my case?

00:17:30.237 --> 00:17:32.281
It's not like there's a war.

00:17:32.365 --> 00:17:33.366
Min-seo.

00:17:34.033 --> 00:17:36.911
Didn't you see your mom
getting hurt while saving people?

00:17:40.039 --> 00:17:42.375
All of this is to protect you, so behave.

00:17:47.713 --> 00:17:48.714
Watch your step.

00:17:50.966 --> 00:17:54.011
I get to bring home
the Pinky I made today.

00:17:54.095 --> 00:17:56.555
Your Pinky at home will be so sad.

00:17:57.014 --> 00:17:59.975
No, the stuffed Pinky is the older sister,

00:18:00.059 --> 00:18:01.936
and the clay Pinky is the younger sister.

00:18:02.478 --> 00:18:05.231
And I can hug the older Pinky to sleep,

00:18:05.314 --> 00:18:07.441
but the younger Pinky
isn't soft enough to snuggle.

00:18:07.983 --> 00:18:09.860
But it lights up!

00:18:11.946 --> 00:18:13.906
I can't wait to meet younger Pinky.

00:18:13.989 --> 00:18:15.157
- Right?
- Yeah.

00:18:21.288 --> 00:18:22.373
Good morning!

00:18:22.456 --> 00:18:24.834
All three of you are heading out together!

00:18:24.917 --> 00:18:26.502
- Good morning.
- Hi, Do-yeon.

00:18:26.585 --> 00:18:28.254
It's an open class at her kindergarten.

00:18:29.422 --> 00:18:31.799
No wonder Do-yeon is so excited.

00:18:31.882 --> 00:18:32.717
Yes!

00:18:34.385 --> 00:18:35.886
How are you feeling?

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:37.012
I'm fine.

00:18:37.096 --> 00:18:39.432
I'm so glad nobody got seriously hurt.

00:18:39.598 --> 00:18:43.769
I always scold Byeong-nam
for being up to no good,

00:18:43.853 --> 00:18:45.104
but he did well this time.

00:18:45.187 --> 00:18:46.105
For sure.

00:18:47.815 --> 00:18:49.483
We're going to be late, Dad.

00:18:49.567 --> 00:18:51.569
Yes, you should go!

00:18:52.278 --> 00:18:54.238
Have a good day in class, Do-yeon!

00:18:54.321 --> 00:18:55.865
Thank you, goodbye!

00:18:55.948 --> 00:18:57.283
- Have a good day.
- You too!

00:18:57.366 --> 00:18:58.617
Hurry!

00:18:58.701 --> 00:19:00.661
KIYUN DREAM KINDERGARTEN

00:19:21.307 --> 00:19:22.892
It's Do-yeon's turn.

00:20:03.432 --> 00:20:06.227
Did you hear her? She sounds so fluent!

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:08.312
Where did she get all that talent?

00:20:08.395 --> 00:20:10.439
You're embarrassing me. Tone it down.

00:20:20.908 --> 00:20:22.326
CHOI DO-YEON

00:20:32.545 --> 00:20:35.965
These are home decor figurines
that the kids made.

00:20:36.048 --> 00:20:38.968
When you turn on the switch at home,

00:20:40.094 --> 00:20:41.720
it becomes a beautiful lamp.

00:20:41.804 --> 00:20:43.514
You can charge it with a USB cord.

00:20:51.897 --> 00:20:53.691
Please don't forget to send us photos.

00:20:53.941 --> 00:20:55.734
We'll add them to the kids' albums.

00:21:04.493 --> 00:21:06.287
I was worried about her joining mid-term,

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:08.038
but she's fitting in well.

00:21:08.122 --> 00:21:09.331
Didn't you hear her teacher?

00:21:09.415 --> 00:21:11.709
She's super popular.

00:21:11.834 --> 00:21:13.168
She's so good at English, too.

00:21:13.961 --> 00:21:14.795
Will you be home late?

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.172
No, well...

00:21:18.132 --> 00:21:20.467
I'll just drop by the hospital after work.

00:21:20.718 --> 00:21:21.844
Byeong-nam is getting discharged.

00:21:23.429 --> 00:21:24.972
Invite him home for dinner.

00:21:25.764 --> 00:21:26.599
Today? Why?

00:21:26.682 --> 00:21:28.350
So we can treat him to a meal.

00:21:28.601 --> 00:21:29.810
You said he lives alone.

00:21:30.269 --> 00:21:32.021
He probably can't cook
with an injured wrist.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:35.316
Let me know if you need me
to grab anything on the way.

00:21:36.317 --> 00:21:37.693
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:21:37.776 --> 00:21:40.154
- You'll buy anything?
- Of course!

00:21:40.863 --> 00:21:42.239
With your allowance?

00:21:42.323 --> 00:21:43.949
- No, with your money.
- Mine?

00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:02.301
The bathroom is around the corner.

00:22:04.428 --> 00:22:06.472
Where? I don't see it.

00:22:07.431 --> 00:22:09.016
Take off your sunglasses first.

00:22:09.808 --> 00:22:11.435
There are no windows, anyway.

00:22:16.565 --> 00:22:18.025
The beds are over there.

00:22:23.072 --> 00:22:25.658
Get me a separate room.

00:22:25.741 --> 00:22:27.326
This isn't a hotel.

00:22:28.327 --> 00:22:30.955
And that stuff is dangerous,
so don't touch anything.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.335
ARMORY

00:22:36.418 --> 00:22:38.128
They're all guns?

00:22:39.004 --> 00:22:40.005
Hey!

00:22:40.673 --> 00:22:42.633
Don't touch any of that. It's dangerous.

00:22:46.095 --> 00:22:47.221
Is this an electrical fence?

00:22:48.305 --> 00:22:50.849
Gosh, they bought so much stuff for me.

00:22:50.933 --> 00:22:53.268
When will I finish them all?

00:22:56.313 --> 00:22:57.147
Anything else?

00:22:57.898 --> 00:22:58.899
Is this all?

00:22:59.316 --> 00:23:00.818
What are you doing here?

00:23:00.901 --> 00:23:02.361
I could've handled it alone.

00:23:02.903 --> 00:23:03.988
Thanks.

00:23:04.488 --> 00:23:05.739
Damn right.

00:23:05.823 --> 00:23:07.825
Aren't you thankful
that this big brother saved you?

00:23:08.409 --> 00:23:10.661
No, for being alive.

00:23:14.707 --> 00:23:17.209
You want to carry this?
You said you could do it alone.

00:23:17.292 --> 00:23:18.419
Where's your car?

00:23:18.502 --> 00:23:20.087
The underground parking lot? Let's go.

00:23:35.102 --> 00:23:38.814
I suffer from some trauma
after an overseas operation.

00:23:39.106 --> 00:23:39.940
Yeah?

00:23:42.026 --> 00:23:44.069
Whenever something happens,

00:23:44.153 --> 00:23:45.696
I hear ringing in my ears.

00:23:45.779 --> 00:23:47.906
I get a headache and feel dizzy, too.

00:23:48.282 --> 00:23:51.410
The sound we hear when we connect a modem?

00:23:51.493 --> 00:23:54.455
The beeps?

00:23:54.538 --> 00:23:55.873
Yeah, something like that.

00:23:57.624 --> 00:23:59.418
But lately,
those symptoms have disappeared.

00:24:00.669 --> 00:24:02.129
Remember what you said?

00:24:03.255 --> 00:24:06.675
That I wasn't in JDD anymore,
and that I was just a regular guy?

00:24:08.343 --> 00:24:11.638
That I didn't need to be alone,
and that we could work together.

00:24:13.599 --> 00:24:15.434
Maybe it's because
I've found people I could trust,

00:24:16.226 --> 00:24:17.603
but the symptoms are gone.

00:24:18.479 --> 00:24:20.230
It's all thanks to you.

00:24:21.065 --> 00:24:24.943
That's who I am, okay, little one?

00:24:25.027 --> 00:24:26.236
Be good to me.

00:24:29.448 --> 00:24:31.325
Why are you giving me the doe eyes?

00:24:31.408 --> 00:24:32.367
Gross.

00:24:33.118 --> 00:24:34.787
Thank you. I mean it.

00:24:37.539 --> 00:24:39.666
Appreciation
is meant to be shown in numbers.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:41.085
I'll send you my bank info.

00:24:46.131 --> 00:24:48.383
Come over later.
General Hwang invited you.

00:24:48.467 --> 00:24:49.468
Me? Why?

00:24:49.802 --> 00:24:51.637
She wants to cook dinner for you
to thank you.

00:24:52.137 --> 00:24:53.013
Really?

00:24:53.097 --> 00:24:54.014
Does that mean

00:24:54.556 --> 00:24:57.101
I get to try the famous curry kimchi stew?

00:24:57.184 --> 00:24:59.812
The curry kimchi stew
you've been raving about?

00:25:00.354 --> 00:25:02.523
I can't wait.

00:25:03.857 --> 00:25:05.234
I'm already salivating.

00:25:07.319 --> 00:25:08.487
This is awesome.

00:25:09.863 --> 00:25:11.115
Oh, wow.

00:25:11.198 --> 00:25:13.951
I was actually worried
about what to make for dinner.

00:25:14.034 --> 00:25:15.160
No need to cook.

00:25:15.244 --> 00:25:16.995
They're all side dishes,

00:25:17.079 --> 00:25:18.789
so just eat them with a fried egg.

00:25:19.081 --> 00:25:20.499
Min-seo can fry an egg, right?

00:25:20.749 --> 00:25:21.917
My husband's good at it.

00:25:22.793 --> 00:25:24.962
Anyway, thank you so much.

00:25:25.045 --> 00:25:26.505
These look so good.

00:25:26.588 --> 00:25:28.257
Don't do anything until you're healed.

00:25:28.507 --> 00:25:30.467
It's fine to take a break
from housework for a few days.

00:25:30.884 --> 00:25:31.718
I know.

00:25:31.802 --> 00:25:34.012
I've been getting so spoiled
since my injury.

00:25:34.763 --> 00:25:36.765
But why stop there?

00:25:37.015 --> 00:25:38.559
You should run for the next election.

00:25:38.642 --> 00:25:39.476
What?

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.230
All city councils and politicians
ever do is lie.

00:25:43.313 --> 00:25:45.607
But you saved a life.

00:25:45.691 --> 00:25:48.026
I agree, you'd improve
our neighborhood for sure

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:49.361
if you were our assemblywoman.

00:25:49.444 --> 00:25:50.279
That's true.

00:25:51.113 --> 00:25:54.783
Quite a lot of people
are trying to sell their homes.

00:25:55.075 --> 00:25:57.703
It's because of all these explosions.

00:25:57.786 --> 00:25:58.620
I know.

00:25:58.704 --> 00:26:00.330
I'm anxious, too.

00:26:01.248 --> 00:26:02.291
Right.

00:26:03.167 --> 00:26:04.668
Gosh, I'd better pack these.

00:26:04.751 --> 00:26:06.253
No, we can do it.

00:26:06.336 --> 00:26:07.880
- You're still here?
- Hey, Su-il.

00:26:07.963 --> 00:26:09.506
- Hello.
- Hey.

00:26:10.424 --> 00:26:11.842
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:26:11.925 --> 00:26:13.510
- Enjoy these, okay?
- Okay.

00:26:13.594 --> 00:26:15.095
- Take care.
- Thanks so much.

00:26:15.179 --> 00:26:16.388
Don't do anything.

00:26:16.471 --> 00:26:18.265
- Can you carry it?
- I can.

00:26:18.348 --> 00:26:19.516
- Bye, then.
- Bye.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.351
- Take good care of her.
- You can stay.

00:26:21.435 --> 00:26:22.644
No, we chatted enough.

00:26:22.728 --> 00:26:23.562
Bye.

00:26:24.897 --> 00:26:25.939
Go home and rest.

00:26:26.023 --> 00:26:27.441
You're still injured.

00:26:27.524 --> 00:26:30.068
Right, I'm going home
to put these in the fridge.

00:26:30.152 --> 00:26:31.403
- Okay.
- See you.

00:26:31.486 --> 00:26:33.030
- Okay, just trust me.
- Okay.

00:26:33.113 --> 00:26:34.072
I'll be back.

00:26:34.156 --> 00:26:35.324
- Will you?
- Yeah.

00:26:35.407 --> 00:26:37.367
Okay, rest up first.

00:26:37.451 --> 00:26:38.619
Okay.

00:26:38.702 --> 00:26:40.454
- She could just rest.
- I'll take these, please.

00:26:41.163 --> 00:26:42.706
Hi, you come here often.

00:26:44.458 --> 00:26:46.960
You want the points, right?

00:26:47.044 --> 00:26:48.962
Yeah, on my manager's account.

00:26:49.755 --> 00:26:52.216
Why do you always
save the points on his account?

00:26:52.299 --> 00:26:54.051
You can use the points like real money.

00:26:54.718 --> 00:26:56.428
Stop doing that for your manager.

00:26:56.511 --> 00:26:57.888
Make your own account.

00:26:57.971 --> 00:26:59.014
What?

00:26:59.306 --> 00:27:02.559
You turned me away last time
because I had no ID on me.

00:27:03.268 --> 00:27:04.478
Who did that? Me?

00:27:04.937 --> 00:27:05.896
Yeah.

00:27:07.856 --> 00:27:09.024
I did no such thing.

00:27:09.566 --> 00:27:10.525
What's your number?

00:27:10.901 --> 00:27:12.319
- It's 010.
- Okay, 010.

00:27:12.486 --> 00:27:14.071
Then, 0191.

00:27:14.154 --> 00:27:15.113
Okay, 0191.

00:27:15.197 --> 00:27:16.240
And 2406.

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:17.741
Nice number.

00:27:19.201 --> 00:27:20.035
All done.

00:27:50.023 --> 00:27:51.149
This is amazing!

00:27:53.777 --> 00:27:54.945
It's curry kimchi stew.

00:27:55.028 --> 00:27:58.365
The famous curry kimchi stew?

00:27:58.991 --> 00:28:00.534
Thank you so much.

00:28:01.034 --> 00:28:02.244
Thank you.

00:28:02.577 --> 00:28:03.787
My gosh.

00:28:07.541 --> 00:28:08.667
It's incredible.

00:28:09.251 --> 00:28:10.627
Do you like it?

00:28:10.711 --> 00:28:13.714
No wonder Kang raves about the rice.

00:28:13.797 --> 00:28:17.884
Each grain is so plump
and has the perfect chew.

00:28:17.968 --> 00:28:19.261
It's delicious.

00:28:19.344 --> 00:28:21.138
Right? Isn't the rice so good?

00:28:21.221 --> 00:28:23.807
It's special rice from my mother-in-law.

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:28.103
Wow, Kang really got lucky with you.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:31.606
I'll pack you some food later.

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:33.442
Thank you, Mi-gyeong.

00:28:33.525 --> 00:28:35.652
That's Ms. Hwang for you, little bro.

00:28:36.069 --> 00:28:38.155
Call me whatever you want.

00:28:38.238 --> 00:28:39.573
Thanks, Mi-gyeong.

00:28:39.656 --> 00:28:41.658
- Ms. Hwang.
- Mi-gyeong.

00:28:43.577 --> 00:28:45.162
- Uncle.
- Yeah?

00:28:45.495 --> 00:28:46.913
Does your hand hurt a lot?

00:28:48.373 --> 00:28:49.207
My hand?

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.251
Oh, this?

00:28:52.544 --> 00:28:54.379
Just a bit.

00:28:57.257 --> 00:28:58.133
What is it?

00:29:05.223 --> 00:29:07.142
Wow, that's magical.

00:29:07.476 --> 00:29:09.227
It doesn't hurt at all anymore.

00:29:09.311 --> 00:29:10.395
- Right?
- Yeah.

00:29:10.479 --> 00:29:13.607
I wished for it to stop hurting
when I blew on it.

00:29:14.733 --> 00:29:16.109
It won't hurt anymore.

00:29:16.193 --> 00:29:18.779
No wonder it's totally fine now.

00:29:20.072 --> 00:29:22.157
- Thank you, Do-yeon.
- You're welcome.

00:29:33.543 --> 00:29:37.839
Being here makes me want to get married.

00:29:40.217 --> 00:29:42.135
- You jealous?
- Yeah.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.888
Just stick to dating.

00:29:45.305 --> 00:29:47.391
Why? But you got married.

00:29:47.474 --> 00:29:48.767
It's for your own good.

00:29:49.309 --> 00:29:53.105
Of course, getting married
is the best thing ever!

00:29:53.188 --> 00:29:54.439
Why don't you want to get married?

00:29:54.523 --> 00:29:55.774
You should.

00:29:55.857 --> 00:29:58.318
- Get married, okay?
- Yeah, sure.

00:29:58.402 --> 00:29:59.486
Hey, Do-yeon.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.196
- Uncle.
- Yeah?

00:30:01.279 --> 00:30:04.116
I have something to show you.

00:30:04.699 --> 00:30:05.534
What is it?

00:30:06.535 --> 00:30:08.870
It's Pinky that I made in class.

00:30:09.746 --> 00:30:11.415
- Come here.
- Okay.

00:30:11.498 --> 00:30:12.541
Do-yeon.

00:30:12.624 --> 00:30:14.584
Stop bothering him. His wrist hurts.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:17.587
Yeah, let's brush your teeth now.

00:30:17.671 --> 00:30:18.505
All right.

00:30:19.089 --> 00:30:21.216
Promise to show me next time, okay?

00:30:21.508 --> 00:30:22.509
Pinky promise.

00:30:22.592 --> 00:30:23.635
Promise.

00:30:27.848 --> 00:30:29.266
Give me a hug before you go.

00:30:31.977 --> 00:30:34.104
Your family's amazing.

00:30:35.814 --> 00:30:37.107
Just stick to dating.

00:30:39.401 --> 00:30:40.944
Would that be better?

00:30:50.328 --> 00:30:51.997
You're sleeping
with the Pinky light on today?

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:52.914
Yeah.

00:30:53.331 --> 00:30:55.000
Goodnight, Pinky.

00:30:57.419 --> 00:30:59.045
"Goodnight, little sis."

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:01.715
Goodnight, Mom.

00:31:02.841 --> 00:31:05.051
- Goodnight, Do-yeon.
- Goodnight.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:56.686
Hurry, Do-yeon.

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:58.438
I'll be late for work.

00:31:58.813 --> 00:32:00.440
Okay, Dad.

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:05.445
Bye, Dad! Have a good day!

00:32:05.529 --> 00:32:07.030
Okay, have fun, Do-yeon.

00:32:07.113 --> 00:32:08.031
See you later!

00:32:08.114 --> 00:32:10.575
- Bye, Dad!
- Bye.

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:17.832
Good morning, Do-yeon.

00:32:18.583 --> 00:32:19.793
Hello.

00:32:30.679 --> 00:32:31.763
Hey, Kang.

00:32:32.931 --> 00:32:34.099
Are you off to work?

00:32:34.182 --> 00:32:35.642
Yeah, are you out for delivery?

00:32:35.725 --> 00:32:37.310
That's a lot of instant noodle cups.

00:32:37.394 --> 00:32:39.354
You know, people should have
a proper breakfast,

00:32:39.437 --> 00:32:41.022
not instant noodles.

00:32:41.398 --> 00:32:44.317
There's this researcher
from Pakistan named Ali.

00:32:44.401 --> 00:32:46.361
You know the victim of the ATM incident?

00:32:46.444 --> 00:32:47.279
He's his friend.

00:32:47.362 --> 00:32:48.488
I feel so bad for him.

00:32:49.281 --> 00:32:50.574
The ATM victim's friend?

00:32:51.283 --> 00:32:52.701
Yeah, what was his name?

00:32:52.784 --> 00:32:55.203
Rashod?

00:32:55.287 --> 00:32:57.080
Rasheet?

00:32:57.372 --> 00:32:58.206
Something like that.

00:32:59.791 --> 00:33:00.750
There we go.

00:33:02.919 --> 00:33:04.963
- Hey, Ali.
- Hello.

00:33:05.046 --> 00:33:07.340
This is Choi Kang.

00:33:07.424 --> 00:33:09.342
You know, Rashi...

00:33:09.426 --> 00:33:10.260
Rashid.

00:33:10.343 --> 00:33:13.263
Yeah, he witnessed the ATM explosion.

00:33:16.933 --> 00:33:19.519
Firstly, may your friend rest in peace.

00:33:20.395 --> 00:33:23.148
He can't understand that.
Use easier words.

00:33:23.231 --> 00:33:24.065
Hey,

00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:26.026
I'm certified in Korean Level 2

00:33:26.109 --> 00:33:27.360
and know all the Chinese characters.

00:33:28.028 --> 00:33:28.945
You can use harder words.

00:33:29.821 --> 00:33:32.198
I wanted to ask you something.

00:33:32.282 --> 00:33:33.867
Were you close with Rashid?

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:37.245
Yeah, we'd been friends since childhood.

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:40.248
But we'd drifted apart in Korea.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.461
I hate to tell you this so late,

00:33:44.544 --> 00:33:47.505
but that explosion
wasn't caused by butane gas.

00:33:47.839 --> 00:33:50.925
You'd need a C-4 or Semtex
for an explosion that big.

00:33:51.009 --> 00:33:52.594
SEMTEX: PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES
DEVELOPED IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA

00:33:52.677 --> 00:33:54.721
- You know what Semtex is?
- Of course.

00:33:54.804 --> 00:33:57.515
My lab works on
detecting explosive materials

00:33:57.599 --> 00:33:58.975
using quantum sensors.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.479
May I ask why you two drifted apart?

00:34:02.729 --> 00:34:04.230
Well...

00:34:04.314 --> 00:34:06.399
We started drifting apart

00:34:06.483 --> 00:34:08.151
when he joined a group called
"Recreation."

00:34:08.234 --> 00:34:10.278
Recreation? Like, parties?

00:34:10.612 --> 00:34:11.446
No.

00:34:11.529 --> 00:34:15.325
Only foreigners residing in Korea
with an invitation can join.

00:34:15.408 --> 00:34:18.828
But they can get pesky, so I didn't join.

00:34:18.912 --> 00:34:22.624
Did Rashid ever talk about Sullivan?

00:34:23.416 --> 00:34:27.504
He did mention that
Sullivan sponsored the group.

00:34:28.713 --> 00:34:30.048
Hold on. Sullivan?

00:34:30.131 --> 00:34:31.424
The Sullivan?

00:34:32.467 --> 00:34:34.094
- Yeah.
- Yes.

00:34:35.387 --> 00:34:36.388
Hold on.

00:34:43.436 --> 00:34:45.855
This belonged to Rashid.

00:34:45.939 --> 00:34:47.774
This guy is Sullivan, right?

00:34:49.067 --> 00:34:51.194
Yeah, that's him, Sullivan.

00:34:52.112 --> 00:34:55.073
Wait, that's Ms. Olivia.

00:34:56.449 --> 00:34:57.826
Olivia.

00:34:57.909 --> 00:34:59.786
She's one of the leaders in the group.

00:34:59.869 --> 00:35:01.287
But she was so pesky.

00:35:11.172 --> 00:35:12.966
I won't let you off with a warning

00:35:13.049 --> 00:35:14.884
if you meddle with my plans again.

00:35:14.968 --> 00:35:16.010
Think of your daughter.

00:35:17.846 --> 00:35:18.680
Thank you.

00:35:19.514 --> 00:35:21.224
May I borrow this photo?

00:35:21.433 --> 00:35:23.351
Sure, you can take it.

00:35:23.977 --> 00:35:25.812
- I have to get going.
- Okay.

00:35:26.688 --> 00:35:28.231
- Have a good day.
- See you.

00:35:30.775 --> 00:35:32.318
KIYUN DREAM KINDERGARTEN

00:35:32.402 --> 00:35:34.404
What can I help you with, Mr. Choi?

00:35:34.487 --> 00:35:36.364
May I speak to Ms. Olivia?

00:35:36.448 --> 00:35:38.742
Ms. Olivia is on holiday from today.

00:35:38.825 --> 00:35:39.826
What is this about?

00:35:43.121 --> 00:35:44.122
Daddy!

00:35:45.081 --> 00:35:46.458
Hey, Do-yeon.

00:35:46.708 --> 00:35:48.126
Why are you here, Dad?

00:35:48.877 --> 00:35:50.587
I just needed to talk to your teacher.

00:35:51.004 --> 00:35:52.088
What are you up to?

00:35:52.172 --> 00:35:53.715
I'm going to the playroom.

00:35:53.798 --> 00:35:55.508
Bye, then. I'll see you later!

00:35:55.592 --> 00:35:57.385
- Okay, see you later.
- Bye.

00:36:00.054 --> 00:36:00.972
All right, thank you.

00:36:04.559 --> 00:36:05.894
Unit 514, right?

00:36:06.186 --> 00:36:09.439
Yes, I found an express order
that was made to this unit.

00:36:09.522 --> 00:36:10.440
Got it.

00:36:33.505 --> 00:36:34.464
Who are you?

00:36:35.715 --> 00:36:36.758
Oh, I'm...

00:36:37.383 --> 00:36:39.886
This is where Ms. Olivia lives, right?

00:36:39.969 --> 00:36:42.388
Oh, the foreigner?

00:36:42.472 --> 00:36:43.723
She moved out yesterday.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.643
I see.

00:36:48.186 --> 00:36:49.270
Thank you.

00:36:51.523 --> 00:36:54.192
HARDWARE DREAM TREE STATIONERY

00:36:54.776 --> 00:36:56.194
How cute.

00:36:56.277 --> 00:36:58.112
My kid made it in class,

00:36:58.196 --> 00:37:00.532
but it's broken and won't turn on.

00:37:02.617 --> 00:37:04.911
I'll need to open it up and check.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:07.038
Will you be okay?

00:37:08.414 --> 00:37:10.458
My fingers are fine.

00:37:10.542 --> 00:37:11.918
- I'll take a look tonight.
- Okay.

00:37:12.001 --> 00:37:13.545
- I'll come back tomorrow.
- Okay.

00:37:17.549 --> 00:37:19.551
Let's see what's wrong.

00:37:54.502 --> 00:37:55.461
Hold on.

00:38:31.372 --> 00:38:34.250
- Hey.
- Kang, you were right.

00:38:35.168 --> 00:38:36.252
There's another bomb.

00:38:37.253 --> 00:38:39.088
Another one? Where?

00:38:39.464 --> 00:38:40.465
Meet me at the bunker.

00:38:40.548 --> 00:38:41.841
I'll head there, too.

00:38:53.645 --> 00:38:54.812
Hey.

00:38:54.896 --> 00:38:56.147
Mi-gyeong.

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:58.566
Take Do-yeon
and go to your mother's house right now.

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:00.443
Why? What is it this time?

00:39:00.526 --> 00:39:01.861
Just go, okay?

00:39:01.945 --> 00:39:04.280
Call me when you get there.

00:39:10.036 --> 00:39:12.121
It's an altered C-4

00:39:12.205 --> 00:39:13.623
with a receiver.

00:39:14.916 --> 00:39:17.710
Kids made these in class?

00:39:17.794 --> 00:39:21.047
Why would you bring a bomb here?

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:22.757
Take it out right now!

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.551
All signals are blocked here,
so it's fine.

00:39:25.635 --> 00:39:26.636
Don't give me that.

00:39:27.345 --> 00:39:29.013
You said this was a safe shelter.

00:39:29.097 --> 00:39:30.431
Nam-yeon!

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.892
Literally everyone's been coming in here.

00:39:32.976 --> 00:39:33.810
How is it safe?

00:39:34.394 --> 00:39:36.270
Ms. Lee, can we just kick her out?

00:39:36.354 --> 00:39:37.480
She's too loud.

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:41.109
I can't. It was an order from above.

00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:44.487
My gosh.

00:39:47.198 --> 00:39:48.032
"Kang Ra-on"?

00:39:49.158 --> 00:39:50.284
What is it?

00:39:50.368 --> 00:39:51.744
He's Do-yeon's classmate.

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:59.919
Kang, does Do-yeon have one of these?

00:40:09.137 --> 00:40:10.930
Please don't forget to send us photos.

00:40:11.222 --> 00:40:13.016
We'll add them to the kids' albums.

00:40:19.022 --> 00:40:20.314
Yes.

00:40:20.398 --> 00:40:22.066
Every kid took one home.

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:23.234
Olivia was behind it.

00:40:23.776 --> 00:40:26.904
So Ms. Olivia is working with Sullivan?

00:40:28.823 --> 00:40:29.699
I think so.

00:40:31.242 --> 00:40:33.036
She didn't come into work today

00:40:33.119 --> 00:40:34.120
and moved out of her place.

00:40:35.288 --> 00:40:37.331
That's the guy from the park, isn't he?

00:40:37.665 --> 00:40:38.624
Yes, it is.

00:40:38.958 --> 00:40:41.294
You're kidding me.

00:40:41.377 --> 00:40:43.421
So she had the kids make bombs?

00:40:44.005 --> 00:40:45.465
How many do you think there are?

00:40:46.132 --> 00:40:48.551
There are 55, excluding this.

00:40:48.634 --> 00:40:49.927
One is at my house.

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:54.474
I know where most of them live,
so I'll look into this.

00:40:54.557 --> 00:40:55.475
Perfect.

00:40:55.558 --> 00:40:58.144
Let's disperse and retrieve them all.

00:40:58.227 --> 00:41:00.021
- Okay, let's go.
- Come on.

00:41:00.104 --> 00:41:02.065
Tell the Vice Minister. It's an emergency.

00:41:02.148 --> 00:41:03.149
- Okay.
- Hurry.

00:41:03.232 --> 00:41:05.985
Nam-yeon, you can't leave me alone.

00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:07.695
I'm suffering from trauma.

00:41:07.987 --> 00:41:10.406
This is the safest place you can be,

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:12.492
so just shut it!

00:41:22.001 --> 00:41:23.127
Why are you out again?

00:41:23.211 --> 00:41:25.129
Get back in there and defuse the bombs.

00:41:25.213 --> 00:41:27.423
They haven't brought any to me yet.

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:30.885
Hey, where's Do-yeon?

00:41:32.136 --> 00:41:33.304
At kindergarten.

00:41:33.387 --> 00:41:36.182
I told Mi-gyeong to take Do-yeon
and go to her mother's house.

00:41:36.265 --> 00:41:37.433
Good thinking.

00:41:37.892 --> 00:41:39.936
Who are you waiting for, anyway?

00:41:42.563 --> 00:41:43.648
There they are.

00:42:13.052 --> 00:42:13.886
Sir.

00:42:14.428 --> 00:42:15.263
Hey.

00:42:19.183 --> 00:42:20.184
Sir.

00:42:20.268 --> 00:42:22.228
- It's been a while, sir!
- It's been a while, sir!

00:42:22.562 --> 00:42:23.396
Hey, guys.

00:42:27.108 --> 00:42:29.443
We did as you told us
and dressed as friendly as possible.

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:31.779
Good job.

00:42:32.572 --> 00:42:33.489
Sir.

00:42:33.573 --> 00:42:35.700
Retrieve all the clay toys
made by the kids.

00:42:35.783 --> 00:42:39.036
Everyone will hand them over
if you say they've found something toxic.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.163
Yes, sir.

00:42:40.788 --> 00:42:41.914
What if they refuse?

00:42:41.998 --> 00:42:44.584
Do whatever it takes
and bring all of them here immediately.

00:42:45.001 --> 00:42:45.877
Yes, sir.

00:42:46.794 --> 00:42:49.380
We'll drop you off at different addresses.

00:42:49.463 --> 00:42:50.423
Retrieve the clay toys.

00:42:50.673 --> 00:42:52.216
Be kind and polite.

00:42:52.425 --> 00:42:53.259
Get to work!

00:42:53.759 --> 00:42:54.760
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:11.944
Can I help you?

00:43:12.028 --> 00:43:13.321
Hello, ma'am.

00:43:14.572 --> 00:43:15.573
Thank you, ma'am.

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.120
I'm so sorry.

00:43:21.537 --> 00:43:22.747
It's fine.

00:43:23.247 --> 00:43:25.291
Su-a, I promise to bring it back

00:43:25.374 --> 00:43:28.711
once I make it all better, okay?

00:43:28.794 --> 00:43:29.629
- Okay.
- Promise.

00:43:29.712 --> 00:43:30.630
Promise.

00:43:48.981 --> 00:43:49.941
Nam-yeon?

00:43:50.274 --> 00:43:51.901
- Here.
- Thank you.

00:43:51.984 --> 00:43:53.319
I'll call you later.

00:44:01.077 --> 00:44:02.995
Sorry for the surprise visit.

00:44:03.079 --> 00:44:05.498
But this is quite urgent.

00:44:08.709 --> 00:44:09.627
Okay.

00:44:23.224 --> 00:44:26.435
We've retrieved 13 so far.

00:44:32.608 --> 00:44:33.734
Keep me updated.

00:44:39.949 --> 00:44:40.783
Yes.

00:44:41.784 --> 00:44:43.661
The VIP is on hold on line one.

00:44:51.168 --> 00:44:52.420
Lee Geun-cheol speaking.

00:45:30.374 --> 00:45:32.168
Hurry, Do-yeon.

00:45:32.251 --> 00:45:34.003
I'll be late for work.

00:45:34.253 --> 00:45:36.005
Okay, Dad.

00:45:37.548 --> 00:45:39.425
CHOI DO-YEON

00:46:00.071 --> 00:46:01.322
You bastard.

00:46:11.707 --> 00:46:13.417
Stop looking for the bombs.

00:46:13.959 --> 00:46:15.294
I'll blow them all up

00:46:15.378 --> 00:46:17.755
if you retrieve one more
from this point on.

00:46:18.547 --> 00:46:21.634
Don't call the cops or run away.

00:46:22.301 --> 00:46:23.427
Don't do a thing.

00:46:23.886 --> 00:46:25.596
What is it that you want?

00:46:26.013 --> 00:46:27.390
Is this your revenge?

00:46:28.891 --> 00:46:29.934
Revenge?

00:46:43.364 --> 00:46:45.157
Call your friends.

00:46:54.125 --> 00:46:55.292
Lee Su-jin speaking.

00:46:58.587 --> 00:46:59.839
It's Mr. Choi.

00:46:59.922 --> 00:47:00.840
Okay.

00:47:01.966 --> 00:47:03.801
What now? I'm busy.

00:47:04.093 --> 00:47:05.219
Stop.

00:47:05.553 --> 00:47:06.679
Stop what?

00:47:08.931 --> 00:47:10.141
Stop defusing the bombs?

00:47:12.643 --> 00:47:13.477
What?

00:47:18.816 --> 00:47:20.025
What's going on?

00:47:20.109 --> 00:47:23.612
Sullivan will blow everything up
if we retrieve more bombs.

00:47:24.029 --> 00:47:24.864
What?

00:48:01.984 --> 00:48:04.445
Sullivan knows we're retrieving the bombs.

00:48:04.987 --> 00:48:07.781
He'll blow up the rest
if we retrieve more.

00:48:08.741 --> 00:48:10.075
I heard.

00:48:10.159 --> 00:48:12.203
We'll need to find another way.

00:48:14.955 --> 00:48:16.790
Hello? Is something wrong?

00:48:17.541 --> 00:48:18.792
I've been ordered

00:48:18.876 --> 00:48:21.462
only to handle the aftermath.

00:48:21.545 --> 00:48:22.379
What?

00:48:25.758 --> 00:48:28.552
They're saying it'll get complicated
if it goes diplomatic.

00:48:29.136 --> 00:48:30.387
Are you kidding me?

00:48:31.013 --> 00:48:34.141
What's the point of handling the aftermath
of a bomb threat?

00:48:34.683 --> 00:48:37.019
In any case,
I can't officially do anything.

00:48:37.102 --> 00:48:41.357
But I'll give you all the equipment
and information you need.

00:48:46.904 --> 00:48:49.490
GENERAL HWANG

00:48:50.241 --> 00:48:51.158
Okay.

00:48:53.661 --> 00:48:54.870
Are you at the kindergarten?

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.372
Did you get Do-yeon?

00:48:56.455 --> 00:48:57.790
I can't find...

00:48:58.541 --> 00:48:59.833
Do-yeon.

00:49:01.335 --> 00:49:02.336
What do you mean?

00:49:02.419 --> 00:49:04.588
I said hi to her at kindergarten earlier.

00:49:05.297 --> 00:49:06.882
What do I do?

00:49:07.132 --> 00:49:08.759
I can't find her anywhere.

00:49:10.427 --> 00:49:11.262
I'll be right over.

00:49:24.567 --> 00:49:26.235
It's someone Do-yeon knows.

00:49:26.318 --> 00:49:27.528
Do-yeon...

00:49:27.611 --> 00:49:30.948
Could we check the security footage
facing the road?

00:49:31.031 --> 00:49:32.116
Oh, yes.

00:49:38.706 --> 00:49:39.540
Olivia.

00:49:41.125 --> 00:49:43.711
Isn't she Ms. Olivia?

00:49:44.003 --> 00:49:47.464
What is she doing there?

00:49:56.015 --> 00:49:56.932
Honey.

00:49:57.725 --> 00:49:58.642
Honey.

00:49:58.726 --> 00:49:59.727
Kang.

00:50:01.312 --> 00:50:02.396
Are you okay?

00:50:07.818 --> 00:50:09.028
Mi-gyeong...

00:50:12.781 --> 00:50:15.534
It'll be okay.

00:50:16.243 --> 00:50:17.620
She'll be fine.

00:50:18.787 --> 00:50:19.872
I promise

00:50:21.081 --> 00:50:22.249
to bring Do-yeon back.

00:50:24.793 --> 00:50:25.961
Bring her back.

00:50:55.658 --> 00:50:57.326
NEW MESSAGE

00:51:03.415 --> 00:51:07.378
The electricity usage at Novus Logistics
is unusually high.

00:51:18.889 --> 00:51:22.393
I get that his daughter died unfairly,

00:51:22.476 --> 00:51:24.728
but why is he trying to set off bombs
on other kids?

00:51:24.812 --> 00:51:26.939
That's exactly what I mean!

00:51:27.022 --> 00:51:29.692
Why is this bastard doing this to kids?

00:51:29.775 --> 00:51:31.902
Ridiculous!

00:51:32.152 --> 00:51:34.405
If we can't retrieve them,

00:51:34.488 --> 00:51:35.948
how about we block off the signals?

00:51:36.448 --> 00:51:37.282
What?

00:51:37.866 --> 00:51:39.910
The bombs are remote-controlled,

00:51:39.993 --> 00:51:41.870
so what if we block off the signals?

00:51:42.371 --> 00:51:43.372
You're a genius.

00:51:44.832 --> 00:51:46.542
All right, let's not waste time

00:51:46.625 --> 00:51:49.044
and focus on how we can stop these bombs.

00:51:49.253 --> 00:51:51.839
For example, we can block the signal by--

00:51:51.922 --> 00:51:53.632
- Emergency!
- What's wrong?

00:51:54.883 --> 00:51:56.593
Do-yeon's gone.

00:51:56.844 --> 00:51:57.928
- What?
- What?

00:51:58.011 --> 00:51:59.263
What are you talking about?

00:52:00.305 --> 00:52:02.641
What do you mean Do-yeon's gone?

00:52:03.475 --> 00:52:04.601
Start making sense.

00:52:04.685 --> 00:52:06.103
This bastard.

00:52:07.229 --> 00:52:08.063
Unbelievable.

00:52:11.734 --> 00:52:12.651
Hey, Kang.

00:52:13.402 --> 00:52:14.611
Where are you?

00:52:15.154 --> 00:52:16.029
Where's Do-yeon?

00:52:18.031 --> 00:52:19.241
I'm on my way.

00:52:23.662 --> 00:52:24.496
Hey.

00:52:25.247 --> 00:52:26.415
You listen to me.

00:52:27.082 --> 00:52:28.292
We'll do everything we can

00:52:29.793 --> 00:52:31.170
to stop the bombs.

00:52:34.298 --> 00:52:35.466
So you just focus

00:52:35.924 --> 00:52:37.342
on bringing Do-yeon back.

00:52:38.343 --> 00:52:39.470
Thank you.

00:52:40.471 --> 00:52:41.722
I'm counting on you.

00:52:41.805 --> 00:52:42.639
Yeah.

00:52:51.523 --> 00:52:54.818
I don't think it's a good idea
to let Mr. Choi go alone.

00:52:55.444 --> 00:52:57.070
Shouldn't we look for Do-yeon first?

00:52:57.154 --> 00:52:58.822
Hey, Nam-yeon, where's Min-seo?

00:52:59.239 --> 00:53:01.408
I checked her social media.
She's at the store.

00:53:01.492 --> 00:53:05.704
But she's very mad
that she's not at the birthday party.

00:53:07.998 --> 00:53:09.041
Here it is.

00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:12.044
Let's see.

00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:18.133
Leave it to Kang to find Do-yeon.

00:53:18.467 --> 00:53:20.093
Let's work on the bombs.

00:53:21.053 --> 00:53:23.639
We can stop them with this.

00:53:31.355 --> 00:53:33.982
We didn't start this battle.

00:53:34.775 --> 00:53:37.486
But it's on us to end it.

00:53:38.195 --> 00:53:39.488
Do not fear death.

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:41.323
What we must fear is

00:53:41.824 --> 00:53:42.783
not doing anything--

00:53:42.866 --> 00:53:43.700
That's enough.

00:53:44.827 --> 00:53:46.245
- And just--
- Everyone knows the plan?

00:53:46.954 --> 00:53:48.038
Don't worry, Ms. Jung.

00:53:49.414 --> 00:53:50.457
Keep us updated.

00:53:50.749 --> 00:53:52.292
Don't worry, Nam-yeon.

00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:56.296
Nam-yeon,
I'll remember everything about you.

00:53:56.547 --> 00:53:57.464
I'm not going to die.

00:53:57.756 --> 00:53:59.591
You go and do your part, okay?

00:53:59.925 --> 00:54:00.884
Okay.

00:54:00.968 --> 00:54:02.219
What are you doing?

00:54:02.302 --> 00:54:03.262
Attention!

00:54:03.345 --> 00:54:04.721
Let's go and end this.

00:54:04.805 --> 00:54:06.723
- Let's go!
- Bring it on!

00:54:07.891 --> 00:54:08.809
Yeah!

00:54:45.554 --> 00:54:47.347
Oh? It's Dad!

00:54:48.098 --> 00:54:49.474
Dad!

00:54:52.936 --> 00:54:55.188
Are you not feeling well?

00:55:09.369 --> 00:55:11.914
Promise to protect me, okay?

00:55:11.997 --> 00:55:14.458
Bye, then.

00:55:14.541 --> 00:55:15.626
I'll see you later!

00:56:13.642 --> 00:56:16.395
Do-yeon!

00:56:19.648 --> 00:56:20.565
Do-yeon!

00:56:22.359 --> 00:56:23.402
Do-yeon!

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:26.613
Choi Do-yeon!

00:56:37.457 --> 00:56:38.500
Do-yeon.

00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:49.177
Do-yeon!

00:56:51.138 --> 00:56:52.180
Do-yeon!

00:56:56.727 --> 00:56:57.644
Do-yeon!

00:57:01.106 --> 00:57:02.024
Do-yeon!

00:57:04.651 --> 00:57:05.569
Do-yeon!

00:57:15.495 --> 00:57:17.330
Choi Do-yeon!

00:57:55.285 --> 00:57:56.161
Do-yeon...

00:57:59.956 --> 00:58:01.500
Do-yeon!

00:58:15.305 --> 00:58:16.890
Do-yeon...

00:58:31.196 --> 00:58:32.697
- Dad.
- Yeah?

00:58:32.781 --> 00:58:35.283
If I meet a bad adult,
I'll scare them with my whistle.

00:58:35.367 --> 00:58:38.286
Yes, make their ears bleed.

00:58:38.370 --> 00:58:39.204
Okay.

00:58:55.554 --> 00:58:56.555
Do-yeon...

00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:01.101
Do-yeon!

00:59:02.352 --> 00:59:05.272
HEROES NEXT DOOR

00:59:45.645 --> 00:59:46.938
Moving underground.

00:59:47.939 --> 00:59:48.940
Everyone ready?

00:59:49.024 --> 00:59:50.442
Let's do this in one go.

00:59:50.525 --> 00:59:52.360
Nam-yeon's station hasn't gone off!

00:59:52.444 --> 00:59:53.695
This isn't working!

00:59:53.778 --> 00:59:54.863
You wanted to make a deal.

00:59:54.946 --> 00:59:56.948
You never change, do you?

00:59:57.032 --> 00:59:58.033
Retrieve the bombs.

00:59:58.116 --> 00:59:58.992
You still have time.

00:59:59.075 --> 01:00:01.119
If you press that, Do-yeon will live,

01:00:01.203 --> 01:00:02.787
but all your neighbors will die.

01:00:02.871 --> 01:00:04.748
They're just innocent people.

01:00:05.457 --> 01:00:06.499
Ms. Lee!

01:00:06.791 --> 01:00:08.335
Who is Kang, seriously?

01:00:08.418 --> 01:00:09.836
He's Changri-dong's hero.

01:00:10.629 --> 01:00:12.214
It's all over now.

01:00:14.633 --> 01:00:16.635
