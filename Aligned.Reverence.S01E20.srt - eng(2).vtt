(No more hiding)

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.580
It's so hot.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.060
Are you alright?

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.620
Are you tired?

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.380
I'm fine.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.100
Why haven't they gotten out
of the carriage yet?

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.460
Go take a look.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.780
Let's see.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.620
Are you good?

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.740
It looks like you are almost recover.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.820
Why did he gets out?

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.979
Let me take a look here.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.380
Junning.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.300
Don't.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.220
What part of your body haven't I seen?

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.619
Why are you shy now?

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.140
Let me see.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.580
Just let me see.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.940
- Junning.
- What's wrong?

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.580
Take your clothes off, hurry up.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.020
Xi Junning, what are you doing?

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.499
I...

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.739
I'm treating his injury.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.779
I am treat...

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.259
You get out.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.420
You...

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.899
Xie Yunyan. Don't you know
not to look at improper things?

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.320
And you pushed me out of the carriage!

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.299
Yunxi, is he using the excuse
of treating your injury

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.300
to take advantage of you?

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.099
I'll go beat him up.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.979
Yan!

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.540
She is treating my injury.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.490
Besides,

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.820
how could she
possibly take advantage of me?

00:02:36.312 --> 00:02:38.695
If anyone's taking advantage,
it's me taking advantage of her.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.099
Yunxi, you are the only male heir
of the Xiao family in this generation.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.170
You can't do this...

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:56.859
Yan.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.180
What nonsense are you spouting?

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.020
Ning is a woman.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.220
A woman?

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.436
Then why has she always been
so improper, and constantly flirts with Yuan?

00:03:08.437 --> 00:03:09.380
This...

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.020
Xie Yunyan.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.579
If you dare to speak ill
of me one more time,

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.100
I'll make sure you can't get out of bed!

00:03:17.562 --> 00:03:18.322
Yan!

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.220
Who told you to act
neither male nor female all day?

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.020
I...

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.820
Xie Yunyan.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.020
Do you want me
to cure your poor eyesight?

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.980
If you don't believe me, ask him.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.940
Then ask her.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.019
And them.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.539
Who doesn't know I'm a woman?

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.980
You're the only fool.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.860
Am I the only one who didn't see it?

00:03:54.975 --> 00:04:00.307
(Proclamation: Xie Yunyan, seven feet tall, tall and slender,
is the heinous culprit who massacred the Wen Manor.)

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.420
The criminal Xie Yunyan
of the Xiao family

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.219
(Proclamation)
who massacred the Wen Manor

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.980
is a heinous culprit.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.620
Authorities are ordered to quickly
investigate and provide his whereabouts.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.180
Let's proceed with the plan today.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.499
We'll split up.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.332
Alright.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.800
(Xie Yunyan massacred
the Wen Manor is a heinous culprit.)

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.482
(Authorities are ordered to quickly investigate
and provide his whereabouts)

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.419
You cannot use force again.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.539
I still haven't found
the source of your poison.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.700
- If the poison flares up again, I...
- Alright.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.060
I won't use force.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.540
Now that the evidence is conclusive,

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.180
I trust Yan can handle it.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.460
Understood.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:18.900
Your Lordship.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.900
He is the victim?

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.900
Indeed.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.139
The full details of this entire matter,

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.020
including the evidence,

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.860
Your Lordship must already understand.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.220
If I were to reveal myself rashly
at this time,

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.140
I am afraid it would alert the enemy.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.300
To bring down Prince Yu,

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.540
Wen Luo must file an imperial grievance.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.500
Are you afraid of death?

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.660
No.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.620
That's good.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.499
As long as you do exactly as I say,

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.419
I guarantee

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.940
you can avenge your father.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.420
Luo,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.800
don't be sad.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.660
When did Young Lady Su
become so distant from me?

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.900
You didn't even tell me about something
as big as leaving the capital.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.220
Yuan,

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.460
why don't you wait for me outside first?

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.660
Your Lordship.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.940
Let's go.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.340
Yuan.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.800
Yan,

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.659
are you truly not hiding it anymore?

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:45.780
Yes.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.220
So, please, from now on,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.140
stop having designs on her.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.939
Yan,

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.500
have you considered

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.660
that you are uncle and sister-in-law?

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.780
If you truly end up together,

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.260
she will face

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.940
a lifetime of gossip and slander.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.139
In the eyes of the world,

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.939
no matter how good Young Lady Su is,

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.660
or how worthy of love she is,

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.780
as long as she
was once your sister-in-law,

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.860
she will be criticized her entire life,

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.539
called promiscuous,

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.060
and violating human ethics.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.940
Thank you for the suggestion,
Your Lordship.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.299
But what I uphold

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.780
is not the discipline
of the Three Bonds and Five Virtues.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.440
Heaven and Earth can bear witness.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.180
As long as we are true to our hearts,

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.299
this relationship

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.420
does nothing
against natural law or reason.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.139
I have done nothing wrong,

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.620
nor has she done anything wrong.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.900
Have you considered

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.939
that this path is difficult?

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.420
She may regret it.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.779
I know

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.380
this world is unfair to women.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.379
Simply because of my affection,

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.300
she has endured much suffering.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.620
This is unfair to her.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.860
But I will do everything in my power
to protect her happiness.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.019
Actually,

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.899
if you truly want her to be happy,

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.060
there is an easier path.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.059
For example,

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.660
Young Lady Su could marry me.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.460
Your Lordship should just keep quiet.

00:08:33.525 --> 00:08:37.595
(Zichen Gate)

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.540
Sir,

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.499
I am the son of Wen Zhihu,
the Director of Maritime Transport.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.220
I have come to the capital
to appeal my case.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.900
I wish to accuse

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.740
Prince Yu.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.739
Prime Minister,

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.540
this commoner is the son of Wen Zhihu,
the Director of Maritime Transport,

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.340
accusing Prince Yu

00:09:03.412 --> 00:09:04.852
of hiring killers

00:09:04.862 --> 00:09:06.595
to massacre my Wen family manor.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.340
You insolent child.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.020
Spouting such nonsense.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.579
The Xianyang yamen reported

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.500
that the person
who killed your entire family

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.700
was Xie Yunyan.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.019
How dare you slander me?

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.460
I

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.780
will send you to meet your father.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.899
Prince Yu,

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.580
spouting such
arrogant nonsense in court.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.739
I

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.140
can charge you with contempt of court.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.859
Prime Minister,

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.180
before my father died,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.219
he handed over all the evidence

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.780
of his collusion with Prince Yu to me.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.779
Please investigate thoroughly.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.432
(To Prince Yu)

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.820
(To Prince Yu)

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.340
Arrest him!

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.020
Bo Ying!

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.100
How dare you touch me?

00:10:16.612 --> 00:10:18.419
(Prince Yu's handwritten order.)

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.500
Smuggling private salt,

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.580
embezzling military rations,

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.460
and selling quenched steel.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.179
Prince Yu,

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.060
you are incredibly bold!

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.579
In the past,
my father sought medicine for me,

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:32.939
and was coerced by Prince Yu.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.940
He was forced to work for him.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.700
In all these years,

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.540
he used the convenience
of river transport

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.019
to help Prince Yu in his affairs.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.457

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.820

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.060
refuse to accept it!

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.220
I have a witness.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.259
The Captain of the Garrison,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.780
Xie Yunyan.
