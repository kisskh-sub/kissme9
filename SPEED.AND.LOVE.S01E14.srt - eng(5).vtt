Morning.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:45.520
Morning.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.730
What is she doing? She's so jumpy.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.240
What's wrong with Sister?

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.540
Still half asleep, I guess.

Why are you here so early today?

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.290
Zhao said you don't like dumplings,

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.060
so I specially made some dishes for you.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.320
You can have some rice.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.360

Is it good?

You don't want to get better?

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.250
I want to see if it makes me cough.

No way.

This answer...

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.909
I'm not particularly satisfied with it.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.450
It sounds like

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.620

Otherwise,

No, you must keep me.

Hurry up and answer my question.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.610
Hurry up.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.250

Maybe you should take a look.

Okay.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.720
You don't accept these imported parts

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.090
and only use your handmade ones instead?

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.620
Do you think that will work?

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.150
Let's just install it and see.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:44.159
Taste it?

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.680
I can tell just by looking.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.610
No progress.

Your RX7

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.160
can hit 700 HP on the dyno.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.130
But when I test-drove it earlier,

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.460
before I could floor it,

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.910
the engine started knocking.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.530
With a Wankel engine,
knocking is inevitable.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.810
Where did you get the parts?

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.120
I didn't use imported parts.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.330
I made some myself.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:47.610
But when the engine temperature
got too high,

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.610
the rotors and the crank started melting

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:50.740
and fused together.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.750
Then buy some imported parts.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:54.280
You can afford it.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.800
Wan Shengbang
has monopolized all the supplies.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.370
I even tried a bigger radiator,

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:01.400
but it couldn't handle it.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.760
Crank, rotors—

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.040
these are all metal.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.440
It's a matter of science,

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.700
not something you can solve by yourself.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.770
So there's no other way?

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.430
I can only use those parts?

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.060
There's always a way.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.890
Since you thought about the radiator,

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.390
you should know it's a cooling issue.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.820
But a bigger radiator doesn't help much,

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.800
because the engine bay's cooling space

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.890
is limited.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.400
Here.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.760
This is...

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.680
the intercooler,

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.250
the radiator,

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:46.250
and the condenser.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:47.090
Look.

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.520
There's no room left to adjust anything.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.200
So we'll tackle each problem one by one.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:54.790
The AC is already removed.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:56.040
Use the extra power

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.210
for the cooling fan.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:00.850
What did I just say?

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.250
There's no space left in the engine bay.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:06.180
But don't you still have the trunk?

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:08.730
Find a spot, add a water tank,

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.690
and run a few pipes for water spray.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.920
It can increase cooling capacity
even more.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.860
If there's no space there,

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.520
find one elsewhere.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.520
It's still the same logic
of cooling with water spray?

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.090
Modifying cars requires brains.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.940
Why compete on metal hardware?

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.130
That old fool Wan Shengbang

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:38.790
hasn't learned anything
after all these years.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:39.880
Same shady tricks

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.210
over and over.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.170
You're the smart one.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.040
All these years of drinking

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.770
still haven't made you stupid.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.610
You little punk,

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.810
you don't want to learn from me anymore?

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:55.220
I'm leaving.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.210
Wait.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.370
What's the rush?

00:11:58.490 --> 00:11:59.400
Going to modify the car.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.250
No hurry.

Where's the food?

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.520
What's the rush?

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.090
I haven't cooked it yet.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.370

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.180
A big customer. Go on.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.670
Don't forget to ask for a good review.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.210

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.730
It's okay. Let him in.

Your food.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.860
I heard that restaurant's chef

cooks pretty randomly.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.810
I thought I'd try my luck.

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:16.210
I didn't expect

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.650

I appreciate your kindness.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.340
But I don't need them anymore.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.110
This meal is on me.

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:34.490
By the way,

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.040
if you're not busy,

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.840
remember to leave a good review.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:40.210
Thanks.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.650
What should I write?

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:44.030
Whatever you want.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.670
The food is really delicious and spicy.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.160

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.010
Delete that.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.920
Didn't you ask me
to give you a good review?

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.010
I asked you to review the food,

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:21.210
not me.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.240
I asked what to write and you said

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:24.450
"whatever you want."

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.850
What will it take for you to delete it?

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:30.490
My fried rice.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:40.730
Just the two of us?

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:42.280
Of course. Who else will there be?

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:42.920
Okay.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.280
See you there.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.760

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.220
Pics or it didn't happen. Post a photo.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.890
I'll arrive in Manshi tomorrow.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.250

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.430
Currently,
Liang Yanfeng's 350Z is in the lead.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:16.730
He gained an advantage in the first half

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:18.190
and is currently in front.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:27.920
D-God,

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:30.230
who do you think will take second?

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.240
I only care about first,

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.640
not second.

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:10.180
DRZ wants to overtake but lacks the skill.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.530
Now it comes down to

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:13.190
Jin Zhao's RX7 versus the S200

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:14.340
to see who's better.

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.310
Brandy, 600 HP is your limit.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.010
It would be embarrassing if you blow it.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:33.460
Thanks for your concern.

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.520
That's your limit,

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:35.400
not mine.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.590
RX7 is accelerating
and trying to overtake,

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.160
but Feng's defense is tight.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:45.920
Passing

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:47.400
won't be easy.

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:27.310
RX7 disappeared!

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:31.810
No, it didn't.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.660
It's still on the main line.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.290
He seems to have turned off
the headlights.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:36.550
What is he trying to do?

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.800
Jin Zhao's RX7 is in first place.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.250
RX7 is still accelerating!

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:15.530
600 HP!

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.440
650 HP!

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.850
It looks like RX7 has gone past 700 HP.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.810
D-God,
why did RX7 turn off its headlights?

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.720
It reduces wind resistance,

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:28.850
helps with a full-throttle sprint,

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:30.510
and throws off the opponents.

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.570
Most people wouldn't dare drive like that.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:33.930
Even without imported parts,

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:35.370
he still managed to push the Wankel engine

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:36.640
to its limit

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.680
without overheating.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.840
Interesting.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:46.920
Brandy, you're going hard tonight.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.850
You've already qualified.
No need to risk your life.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.480
The Wankel-powered RX7
crossed the finish line!

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.200
Tonight's champion is RX7!

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:19.400
Not bad.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:21.460
You did it again.

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:46.510
You went back on your word.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.370
We agreed on tonight.

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:54.570
I'm sorry.

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.430
I forgot there was a race tonight.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:59.960
Let me find a place for us to celebrate.

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:07.220
[Professional Oversleeper: Where are you?]

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.100
No, thanks.

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:12.850
Maybe another day.

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:14.160
You look tired.

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:15.570
Find a place to rest.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.970
I need to get back to Manshi.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.720
Overnight?

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:21.960
By the way,

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.230
how did you manage the cooling system?

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:26.930
Radiator, intercooler,

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.370
and AC evaporator—

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.850
arranged at certain angles.

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:31.130
Who taught you that?

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.690
That uncle who's always drunk.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:02.070
Going out?

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.940
I haven't seen you for a few days again.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.610
Still busy lately?

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.640
Why are you in such a hurry to save money?

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.890
Eager to get married?

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.800
Can you introduce someone to me?

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:29.810
Sure.

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:32.550
There are many beautiful girls
in my class.

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:35.130
I'm too busy.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.140
I don't have time for that.

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:52.890
When you messaged me last night,

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.940
I was still in Qingshi.

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:57.480
I rushed back overnight
to take you to school.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.480
And you're still pouting like this?

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:01.480
I'm not pouting.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:05.920
See for yourself.

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:08.770
I'm not.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.210
Let's go. Or you'll be late.

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:12.500
I'm not leaving.

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.670
I'll watch you go in.

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:27.020
I'll wait for you after school,

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:29.060
take you back to the garage,

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:31.270
and make something tasty for you.

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:33.190
Give me a smile.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.290
Focus on your class.

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:04.860
I'll be waiting for you.

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:15.220
Why do you suddenly want to cook today?

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.690
You guys have always cooked for me before.

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:18.960
Today I want to show you my skills.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.810
And hasn't Sanlai been saying
he wants to eat

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:22.670
squirrel-shaped mandarin fish?

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:29.860
Which one is the mandarin fish?

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:31.240
This one.

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:35.240
Sir, please gut this fish.

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.770
You'll have to wait in line.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.530
Then just wrap it up.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:41.920
Okay.

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:45.240
Don't they help gut the fish here?

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.560
Can't you see there's a line?

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.580
You know how to gut it, right?

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:52.030
Don't worry.

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:53.370
How can I not worry?

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.770
350.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:26:59.290
Thank you.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.090
That guy...

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.770
That guy has been to the garage before,
right?

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:13.100
I don't know him.

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:14.160
You don't?

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.890
I think I've seen him
at the garage before.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.770
Don't you remember?

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.900
Do you know how many people

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:24.610
come to the garage every day?

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:25.850
I'm swamped.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.200
How can I remember everyone's face?

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.640
Here you go, sir.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.850
-Thank you.
-Thank you for coming.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:47.020
Is there anything else you want to eat?

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:49.390
This should be enough.

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:50.440
Then wait here for me.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.570
I need to make a call.

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:03.360
What is it?

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.240
Check out the fruit.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.770
What would you like?

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:27.070
I'll take two boxes.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.610
100 per box.

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:33.930
If we wait another month,

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.160
strawberries will be much cheaper.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.660
What if you don't want them a month later?

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.760
Who said I wanted to eat them?

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:44.230
I want them.

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:47.570

♪ Would you like that? ♪

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.770
Why is it so thick?

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:49.200
I just used ketchup,

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.140
stir-fried it a bit in the pan,

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.530
then added a little white wine,
cooking wine, and sugar.

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:54.740
♪ Would you like that? ♪

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:55.540
What's wrong?

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:56.720
Nothing.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:57.730
So complicated?

00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:59.240
♪ Would you like that? ♪

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.240
I thought it would be super easy.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.260
I thought you only needed

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.400
-to pour the sauce over it.
-Really.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.010
There are tutorials online.

Have some juice.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:47.850
Zhao,

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.500
have you been in

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.530
some kind of trouble lately?

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:52.960
You can tell me.

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:55.000
Maybe I can help.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.520
It's nothing.

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:10.510
It smells so good.
I want some strong coffee too.

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:12.130
You're too young.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.640
No strong coffee for you.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.230
Brandy,

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:28.130
I heard about it.

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.140
Top three in the alliance.

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:31.000
Impressive.

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:33.680
So, tomorrow,

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:35.090
let's celebrate.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.610
Let's invite a few friends.

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:37.890
Bring Jiang Mu too.

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:38.900
Okay.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:45.920
Is it good?

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:51.180
I guess I really am too young.

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:28.310
This courtyard
has such a great atmosphere.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.260
You mean these lights?

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.480
They're the only thing

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.850
my ex left me.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:33.969
Where is she now?

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.290
She's my ex now.

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:36.889
She once had a fight with me

00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:38.100
over something trivial

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.560
and threatened to break up.

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.820
I didn't give in to her.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.020
Then she got angry,

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:43.850
packed her things, and left.

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:44.830
Never came back.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.400
Crazy Jin isn't good with women.

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:49.120
He goes through many breakups every year.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.620
None of his relationships
lasted over 3 months.

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.409
What are you talking about?

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.480
Nana and I lasted more than 6 months.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.820
You have the nerve to say that?

00:34:58.330 --> 00:34:59.440
You dated for 2 months,

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.480
broke up for 6 months,
then got back together for half a month.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.330
That's two and a half months total.

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:03.440
Not even 3.

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.520
How are you counting?

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:09.370
The whole process lasted 6 months.
That's half a year.

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:11.100
You two aren't much different.

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.810
But your ex was also called Nana?

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:14.290
All his exes

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.370
were either Nana or Nini.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.180
Same names, different girls.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.890
You have the nerve to say that?

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:22.440
You're still single.

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:25.600
Sanlai.

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:27.890
You've never had a girlfriend?

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:28.690
No.

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.330
He's been single since birth.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.700
Didn't you date Nana before?

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.800
What are you saying? Don't talk nonsense.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.930
We were just neighbors for a few years.

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.330
His dad was my aunt's ex-boyfriend.

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:45.650
Your aunt?

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:47.770
Lin Sui's mother?

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:49.600
No, not Lin Sui's. Another aunt.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.210
Sanlai's mom is from Northeast China.

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:52.290
She was my mom's college classmate.

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:54.170
So we've known each other since childhood.

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:55.770
After his parents divorced,

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:56.960
his dad took him and moved away,

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.820
so we weren't neighbors anymore.

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:00.080
Northeast China?

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.330
No wonder Sanlai's eating habits

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:03.260
are so northern.

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:05.000
He loves noodles and dumplings.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.250
He doesn't just eat them himself.

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:07.330
He makes us eat too.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.120
Now our eating habits

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.980
are all influenced by him.

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:18.210
Why did it take you so long
to bring the alcohol?

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:20.340
Come on, why did you only bring one box?

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.060
This isn't enough for anyone.

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:23.870
Can you even handle that much?

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.130
My nickname is "Box-by-box Drinker."

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:27.300
Come on.

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:29.080
Mu, one for you.

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:32.490
Yang.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.860
-Don't drink too much.
-Here.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:35.860
Thank you, Crazy.

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:39.390
We're at my place today.

00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:41.520
There are plenty of drinks.
Help yourselves.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.400
I'll be upset
if someone doesn't drink enough.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:43.850
Come on!

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:44.920
-Let's drink together.
-Here, here.

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:45.730
Bottoms up!

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:48.370
Catch the ducks!

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:49.000
How many?

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:49.910
Quack!

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.000
-I said "how many!"
-You have to catch them first.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:52.600
You haven't caught them yet.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.400
I can't keep up.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.800
-I'll punish myself with a drink.
-Come on.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:57.950
Cheers.

00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:59.970
-Come on.
-Come on.

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:01.850
It's such a fun day.

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:03.310
Why didn't Iron Cock come?

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.850
He had to go home for something.

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:08.270
Alright, let's continue.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.210
Let's continue. Starting with you.

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:11.140
Catch the ducks!

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:11.930
How many?

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:12.730
Five!

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:13.520
Got them!

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:14.250
Quack.

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:15.100
Quack.

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:15.600
Quack.

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:01.770
Catch the ducks!

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:02.210
How many?

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:02.810
Three!

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:03.700
Got them!

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:04.510
-Quack.
-Quack.

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:04.850
Quack.

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:05.400
Catch the ducks!

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.000
How many?

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:12.760
I need to take a call.

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:13.810
Hey, get me some more skewers.

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:14.490
Get me some skewers.

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:16.210
-Crazy Jin wants skewers.
-This is good.

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:17.520
The balcony is good, right?

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:17.960
It's awesome.

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:20.290
Come by more often. Make yourself at home.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.100
No problem.

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:21.690
Okay.

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:22.960
Let's switch to another game.

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.770
Let's play this. Let's play cards.

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:26.040
Let me think...

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:29.100
Just guess black or red
and compare the numbers.

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:30.310
Starting with you.

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:31.850
Black or red?

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:32.560
Black.

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:33.410
Red.

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:35.060
See?

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:36.580
-It's black.
-Drink up!

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.130
The first one, black or red?

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:38.960
Black.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:40.120
Drink up.

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:41.440
Red.

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:43.470
-Drink up.
-I'll drink too.

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:44.210
You.

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:44.850
Black.

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:47.370
You don't need to do it. Skip.

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:05.880
Okay.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.180
I'll talk to you when I get home.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.240
I'm hanging up now.

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:31.890
Are you drunk?

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.170
No.

00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:35.080
I'm perfectly sober.
