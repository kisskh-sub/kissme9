[The Vendetta of An]

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.020
[A day ago]

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.050
Gu Yu was locked up

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.380
in Zuihua Tower at the market.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.490
All this trash

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.260
was hauled from over there.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.290
Yeah.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.370
The trash from Zuihua Tower

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.130
gets dumped here.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.410
Say it again.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.770
What exactly happened that day?

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.260
I saw it myself.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.380
Wang Pu and his men

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.380
chained up Gu Yu

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.930
and dragged him into Zuihua Tower.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.140
Say it again.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.020
Wang Pu and his men

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.420
chained up Gu Yu

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.200
and dragged him

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.650
into Zuihua Tower

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.060
like some stray dog.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.340
Say it again.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.650
Wang Pu had Gu Yu in chains.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.770
Iron chains.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.300
Two Huben men were dragging him along.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.930
His legs wouldn't move at all.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.690
His hands were gripping

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.580
the chain so tightly.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.850
The wound on his neck

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:45.740
could be seen so clearly.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:46.690
A wound on his neck?

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.770
Gu Yu was hurt.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.460
There should've been

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.650
bloody rags in the trash.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.240
Used ointments and medicine

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.210
would've given off

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.060
a smell.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.990
No.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.970
This isn't right.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.690
So,

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.620
taking Gu Yu to Zuihua Tower

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.300
was nothing but a diversion.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.530
What?

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.020
A diversion.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.340
Huai'an,

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.010
I know

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.300
where they're keeping Gu Yu.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.180
It was a girl.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.060
General, who are you thinking of?

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.420
Don't you think

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.300
she looks a little like you?

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.130
Day in and day out together,

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.690
have you started to see me differently?

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.890
Of course.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.490
Your wounds are almost healed.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.420
Let me take the bandage off.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.570
It's getting late.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.690
You should rest, General.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.570
Yuan.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.910
This is for you.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.320
Thank you

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.430
for taking such thoughtful care of me these days.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.450
But didn't you tell me

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.130
that you'd grant anything I asked?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.840
I'll agree to anything you want.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.060
But first, your blade

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.180
should be set aside.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:49.820
Don't blame me.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.620
Aren't you

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.220
hiding a blade too?

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.010
General.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.370
It feels like a lifetime

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.740
since we last met.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.150
When word came that His Majesty had killed you,

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.770
I was the one who went to claim your body.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.250
But the body wasn't yours.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:23.980
Seeing you alive now

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.570
isn't a surprise.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.220
What surprises me

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:29.660
is that we'd meet again here.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:35.300
White Hair,

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.010
it's been a long time.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.690
You've been planning against the Huben

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.560
for quite a while, haven't you?

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.060
Tonight isn't the time to reminisce.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:50.810
We need to think fast

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:51.780
and get you out of here.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.940
I'm not leaving. Not yet.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.450
Maybe it's been too long since you saw me.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.860
Perhaps you've forgotten

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.130
the way I work.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.250
Maybe you forgot

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.220
that I'm still a general.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.060
So many of my soldiers were slaughtered.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.980
I have to stay here.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:16.850
An eye for an eye.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.490
There must be vengeance.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:24.250
You're going to help me.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:33.780
Gu Yu.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.890
Wumei killed the men guarding you.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.950
From now until the bodies are found,

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:39.870
it's a day at most.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.060
Yan Fengshan has shown up.

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:44.040
He's back in Chang'an.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.010
He's got at most a day.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.180
So, you're going to use half a day

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.100
to help me plan a way to get revenge.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.490
You can do it.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.220
[Episode 12]

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.100
Mr. Wang Pu, we should pull back.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.810
As of now,

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:24.300
Wang Pu already knows.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.110
What he doesn't know

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.040
is that the Baiwenhu will strike back at the Huben.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:56.450
General.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.020
The Huben Army has started moving out.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:14:59.970
We need to go.

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.810
Mr. Wang!

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.180
Mr. Wang!

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.880
What is it?

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.060
You should take a look at the market.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:53.900
Gu Yu.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.320
He really is a commander

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.780
you can't help but admire.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.780
A life for a life.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.330
And the one plotting for him

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.330
is a sharp mind too.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:13.900
Let me think.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:15.300
Mr. Wang,

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.260
I did the same job for seven years

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.660
prior to joining the Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:20.300
Sorting things is second nature.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:22.020
I'm quick to spot what's valuable.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.420
There's always something

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.780
worth picking up where I look.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.730
Digging clues out of trash.

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.090
They saved Gu Yu,

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.660
and even set a trap for me.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.780
This garbage picker is the first one.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:37.850
Di Lu?

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:39.850
He's been gone a long time.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.090
He's probably dead.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:43.020
Then, this grey-haired one

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:43.940
is the second.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.140
If he's the suspicious one,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.450
that means...

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.730
The people you told me to check on

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.540
have all been tailed.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:55.900
No issues.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.300
But if you're not convinced,

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.000
I can just kill them all.

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:02.580
Questioning them one by one

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.810
is beyond my patience.

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.410
That old witch.

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.130
Aunt Xin can't be trusted either.

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:19.000
From here on out, every word I say

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:19.920
must be kept in mind.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.300
From West Third Alley to West Fifth Alley,

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.120
the whole area

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.410
must be sealed.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.570
They'll try to break out from there.

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:27.570
Understood.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.060
Take more men.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:31.410
To the alley entrances.

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:33.570
Keep an eye on that old witch.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.300
Don't you dare fight her.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:36.740
You may not win.

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:37.730
Got that?

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.890
Got it.

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:39.700
Move.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.260
Search all of Hidden Soldier Alley

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:45.980
for Li Sangeng and Wang Xing.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.570
Wang Xing's real name

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.300
is Xie Huai'an.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:56.370
Understood.

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.650
You two,

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:02.820
time to pull out.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:04.140
The general ordered us

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:05.460
to keep you both safe.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:11.920
It's time.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.370
Once we're out,

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.820
you can become Han Ziling again.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:34.810
Go!

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:01.070
Didn't expect the Huben

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.850
to react this fast.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.130
No idea whether General Gu succeeded.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.940
Most likely he failed.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.980
The Huben's movements now

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:10.940
are too orderly.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.260
Which means

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.970
their command center

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:14.940
hasn't fallen into chaos.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.020
Wang Pu is still alive.

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:18.410
His counterattack

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:19.500
is coming our way.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.170
Move.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:19:59.810
The way ahead is full of Huben.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.220
Alright.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:14.940
Go warn Gu Yu.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:16.740
Tell him the ward wall here is a trap.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:17.810
They can't come here yet.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.220
You all break out together.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.260
You go. I'll stay.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:23.650
No time to argue.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.410
Hurry!

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.780
Wait.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:30.980
You need to tell Gu Yu

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.460
that we already made it out.

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:35.290
Only after we escaped

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.090
did the ward wall get surrounded.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.570
You get me?

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:40.420
I do.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:42.210
- Go! - Protect the general!

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:43.060
Yes.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:49.300
You two,

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:50.410
I'm heading out.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:51.620
Take care.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.620
Thank you both

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.700
for rescuing the general

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:54.610
for the Baiwenhu Army.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.320
Hold on.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.370
No time to waste.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.020
Ziling.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.500
Go.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.980
With me here,

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:32.130
it doesn't matter how many more come.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.300
I'll say it again.

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:55.090
With me here,

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:58.220
no number of men will make a difference.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:11.770
General!

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:12.880
- General! - General!

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:19.790
I, Gu Yu, thank you all

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.940
for avenging our fallen soldiers.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.370
We can't stay here.

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:24.800
Let's head to the ward wall.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:26.700
No!

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:29.540
General,

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:30.940
the planned extraction point

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:31.740
is busted.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.940
The Huben Army has it surrounded.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.020
What about Xie Huai'an, Han Ziling,

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:36.740
and the others meant to receive us?

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.130
They've already made it out.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:39.190
The Huben encirclement

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:40.840
formed after they escaped.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:42.770
Mr. Xie Huai'an told me to inform you

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:44.490
so you don't fall into the trap.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.060
Good. They're safe.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.330
We have enough men to break through.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:54.460
Let's move.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.330
Break out from the west wall.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:57.580
- Yes! - Yes!

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:00.510
Search thoroughly.

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:01.600
Leave no stone unturned.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.200
- Yes. - Yes.

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:23.890
Head for the southwest corner

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:24.720
once we get out.

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.640
I pile the big trash over there.

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:28.050
Stack the wooden crates.

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:29.150
You can scale the wall.

00:23:29.151 --> 00:23:35.865
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:32.090
This is the last chance.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.410
This way.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:56.620
There's an ambush.

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:57.250
Ready.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.320
General, let's go.

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:48.850
We've gone in circles

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.620
and ended up back here.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.130
Where it began

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.780
is where it ends.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.360
I figure Di Lu

00:25:58.270 --> 00:25:59.740
wanted to drag us down with him.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:02.700
But Di Lu isn't even here.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:04.730
Right?

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:24.610
How many soldiers

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.980
can be mobilized from Chang'an?

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.060
A thousand.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.130
Before entering Hidden Soldier Alley,

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.810
I ordered everyone to arm up.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.460
They're ready to move.

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.460
You've seen how big Hidden Soldier Alley is.

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:37.730
A thousand men

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:40.190
are not enough to smash through.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.500
With this badge, you may enter the palace,

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:50.700
and see His Majesty.

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:53.390
Mobilize the Imperial and Right Cavalry Guards

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.330
and

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.150
encircle Hidden Soldier Alley completely.

00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:00.500
I want Xie Huai'an and Han Ziling

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:02.330
captured alive.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.370
I know Huai'an's tricks

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.130
all too well.

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:12.890
He always says those sentimental things,

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.300
letting others take the path to life,

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.220
while he walks

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.300
toward the dead end himself.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.090
You

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.460
lied to me.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:31.410
They haven't come out yet.

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:35.780
Please forgive me, General.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.610
I blame no one.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.060
I know

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.370
I have to get out of there.

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:45.370
Tonight, in all of Chang'an,

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.650
there's something more important

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:48.850
than anyone's life or death.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.220
But whether they live or die

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.220
depends on

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:55.260
how fast you can

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.580
get His Majesty to send troops.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:00.830
Yes.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.750
Let's go.

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:12.780
Take me to meet those four distinguished guests.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:14.740
General,

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:16.700
should you change clothes first?

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:18.540
No need.

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:21.510
If you want people to bow their heads,

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:23.610
clean clothes won't do it.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:26.700
What matters is

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.540
whether our blade

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:30.370
is hard enough.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:32.570
Later on, I worried

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:33.980
Di Lu's body might be found.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.370
So I went back down to the cellar.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:39.890
But the body was already gone.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.260
Di Lu once told me

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:44.980
that even in death,

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:46.740
he wanted to die in a wine jar.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:48.840
So later,

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.270
I dug up his body and burned it.

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:55.170
I put the ashes in a wine jar,

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.260
and buried it back in the cellar.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.410
So...

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:00.570
you were wrong.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.370
Di Lu called you a friend,

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:07.330
and he was right.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.330
From here on,

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:14.890
how many more will you kill?

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.330
I don't know.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.780
Maybe just one.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.240
Maybe a lot more.

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:33.770
Just one?

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:39.130
Yan Fengshan?

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:45.810
Yes.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:48.540
Can you kill him?

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:49.740
I can.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.260
As long as he uses the travel pass

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:01.700
I wrote for him to enter the city,

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:05.020
he'll be tailed.

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:06.740
He'll walk into an ambush.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.980
And he'll end up dead.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:28.940
The travel pass

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:31.000
for General Fengshan

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.060
to enter the city

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:35.170
has already been sent out?

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.330
Yes.

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:54.250
Xie...

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:56.640
Huai...

00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:58.980
An...

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.120
How far is the exit

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.160
in the southwest corner?

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:09.810
It is very close.

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:11.400
A hundred bu away.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.330
But the moment we move,

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.650
they will notice us.

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.850
Think again.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.500
There must be another way.

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.060
It is already a dead end.

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:26.960
We've run out of time.

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:41.980
No.

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:46.300
There must still be another way.

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.170
The window behind you

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:56.300
opens to the back street.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.500
I'll go and draw the Huben away.

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:01.850
You leave from here.

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:05.610
I'll draw the Huben away.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.220
As long as my head's still on my neck,

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.980
I'll figure out a way to save myself.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.460
Why'd you make that Baiwenhu man

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:16.260
trick Gu Yu?

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:19.610
Because you know

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:21.500
there are things

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:22.850
only Gu Yu can settle.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:23.780
Correct?

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.350
When it's your turn,

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:29.740
you start playing a fool.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.610
Xie Huai'an, answer me.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.740
With all your wit,

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.130
are you able to take

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.060
the Huben's fists,

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:38.170
or outrun their blades?

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:42.540
You've got to stay alive.

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:46.260
Only you can bring down the Huben.

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:49.900
If you really feel guilty,

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:51.930
then carry my death with you

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:53.610
and kill Yan Fengshan.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.330
When you finally destroy the Huben,

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.740
that'll count as avenging me.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.610
I've always been a scholar.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.330
To die like a hero,

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:16.260
like a real man,

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.060
is worth it.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.060
Ziling.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:28.810
Wait a moment.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:31.610
Give it one more moment.

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:38.330
Ziling.

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:47.460
