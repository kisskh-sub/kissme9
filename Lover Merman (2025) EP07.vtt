"Lover Merman"
(Episode 7)

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.160
(Previously)

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.290
(Previously)
It's not just a near miss,

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.010
I think I'm about to collide
with you for real.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.420
Ping,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.690
I think we should keep some distance for now.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.060
But I'm sorry...

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.030
for crossing the line too much.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.890
Didn't you say you wanted to

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.880
recheck your own feelings first?

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.770
Maybe

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.290
I was just trying to use him to replace Namhom.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.720
You're not trying to avoid me, are you?

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.190
Yes,

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.020
I really am avoiding you.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.020
From now on,

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.810
I'll personally take charge of Nawa's safety.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.350
Are you sure it's okay

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.540
for you to sneak out at this hour?

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.640
But I couldn't stand missing you anymore.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.560
I still want to be with you.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.020
Nawa,

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.830
If you walk away with him right now,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.200
you'll never see me again.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.510
Can I talk to you Phraphai alone?

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.370
I'm sorry, Phraphai,
for talking to you this way…

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:15.920
I've fallen in love with Mr. Phurit.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.360
Please let me follow my heart.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.130
Huh?

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.090
Who came looking for me?

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.560
You told me

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.170
you had a huge fight with Ping.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.090
My guess is…

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.410
he's probably just feeling hurt.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.560
I think maybe…

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.770
tonight, or tomorrow, he might...

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:40.900
It has to be tonight.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.190
It has to be tonight.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.220
If I don't see Ping tonight…

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.730
I'll never see him again.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.390
Never see him again?
What do you mean by that?

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.570
What do you mean it has to be tonight?

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.610
Today's gonna be rough.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.040
Ping's off, and Nawa's not here either.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.460
I don't get your mom.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.380
Why'd she have to take Nawa out
for errands today?

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.560
Tonight's a full moon.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.140
Ma'am...

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.260
is Ping a merman?

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.400
If you manage to reach Ping,
please call me right away.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.110
My brother's a merman too.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.900
I know what happens

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.380
if they don't purge the poison tonight.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.580
If you tell me the truth,

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.280
it might help me find him faster.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.520
Ma'am…

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.890
There's something I need to confess.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.980
I'm in love with your son.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.680
And honestly, this is something
I should be saying to him,

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.490
not to you.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.770
But right now,
I don't care if Ping's human

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.080
or merman,

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.290
I just don't want him to disappear.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.540
If I never get to tell him this myself,

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.220
I'll hate myself for the rest of my life.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:34.380
It's my fault…

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.180
It's all my fault.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.690
Please, calm down, ma'am.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.300
Please calm down first.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.930
What matters is finding Ping.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.460
You can tell me everything in the car.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.360
Thank you.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.970
Thank you so much.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:13.400
Dad!

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.370
Dad!

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.410
Dad!

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.420
Who did this to you?

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.680
Who?

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.930
Was it the humans?

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.140
I'll handle this myself.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:59.950
Calm down, Phraphai.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.130
What happened to your father

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.850
has nothing to do with the concession deal.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.890
What do you mean by that, Grandpa?

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.780
The humans who came to hunt mermen,

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.430
the headman already dealt with them.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.730
The person who killed him…

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.300
was someone your father
had business conflicts with.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.740
Let the police handle it by the law.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.710
Grandpa Samut,
stop defending those damn humans!

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.600
Didn't you see?
They killed my father!

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.440
Just tell me who it was,

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.640
I'll show them not to mess with mermen.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.230
The one who killed your father
was a merman.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.420
You should've known your father better.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.580
Before you came,

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:03.900
we found proof

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.840
of all the terrible things
he'd done to the culprit.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.520
They're not so different.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:17.290
Now,
if you're truly choosing not to seek revenge,

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.740
then

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:22.590
there's something you should know…

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.660
about what happened 20 years ago.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.660
I was so happy today.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.130
We spent the whole day together.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.560
Nawa.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.370
Where are you going?

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.440
Are you not feeling well?

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.510
Tonight…
there's somewhere I need to go.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.090
Where? Let me go with you.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:24.530
It's fine.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.480
I'll be quick, I'll come right back.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:37.340
Are you hiding something from me?

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.970
You know what hurts me the most?

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.760
That even you treat me like an outsider.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.990
You never tell me anything,
you never let me understand.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:01.720
Mr. Phurit.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.870
If I tell you the truth,

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:10.300
can you promise me one thing?

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:14.910
Promise you won't leave me.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:22.420
Nawa…

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.530
I don't know

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.490
what you're about to tell me,

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:33.730
but I promise

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.160
I'll stay by your side no matter what.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:51.060
Nawa!

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:54.940
Back off.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.780
I don't have time to explain!

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:58.250
Phraphai!

00:11:59.060 --> 00:11:59.960
Calm down!

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.700
What's wrong with Nawa?

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.040
You're going to kill Nawa.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:05.940
Phraphai.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.190
My father just passed away today.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.350
I can't lose you too.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.130
I think we should keep some distance for now.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:36.980
I feel like we've gotten too close.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:38.990
I'm worried about what people might think.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:45.970
Ping!

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:48.900
Phana!

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:54.540
I've been looking everywhere for you.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.260
Your mom came to the shop

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.490
and told me everything.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:01.600
My mom?

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.940
She's so worried about you, you know?

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.590
Can I ask you something straight?

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:13.540
Since the day I was born,

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.150
have you ever loved me?

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:18.670
If you hate me that much,

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:20.980
why don't you just kill me?

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:31.690
If I walk out of your life right now,

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:34.500
will that make you happy?

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.340
Go wherever you want.

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:39.260
I don't want anything to do with you anymore.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:43.800
That's impossible.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:50.170
She feels guilty, Ping.

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:56.220
The moment she realized
you might never come back,

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.040
she finally understood.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:02.590
She realized you've always been her everything.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.040
I'm sorry, Ping.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:16.970
For avoiding you,

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:19.680
for being cold to you.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:22.520
Actually,

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.790
I just wanted to be sure
of my feelings toward you.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.780
I want to be able to say confidently

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.010
that you're not a replacement for anyone.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.130
But because…

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:41.140
I really do love you.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.360
I love you so much.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.340
Even if it took me too long to realize.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.960
I love you so much, Ping.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.600
Phana…

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:51.820
when you said my mom
told you everything…

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.740
Does that mean you know that I...

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.720
That you're a merman?

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:01.150
I don't know if you know

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.230
that Nawa's a merman too.

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:07.380
So you already knew, huh.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.420
You know, to me,

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.850
there's no real difference between
mermen and humans.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.210
We're just born in different kinds.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.370
But it is because of the stories
from the past that we have heard,

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.560
that made me believe

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.840
our kinds shouldn't love each other.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.460
That's why I kept trying to keep
Phurit and Nawa apart.

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:36.590
But...

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.750
once it happened to me…
I stopped caring about all that.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.130
I just want you to stay by my side.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.250
Don't disappear again.

00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:10.880
Are you sure, Phana?

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:13.540
Yeah.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.360
Go cleanse off the poison,

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.320
then come back with me.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.520
Your mom's waiting for you too.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:28.640
Give me another chance, for me, for her,

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:31.690
and for yourself.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.150
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:28.560
On this island,

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:30.910
there are still a lot of

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.030
complicated things going on

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.390
and I can't tell you everything.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.480
I believe they really once
lived here on Khen Island.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:47.080
But probably not anymore.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.650
And I also believe that

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:52.910
mermen and humans can never coexist.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.450
They say there are still mermen living

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:58.020
among us on Khen Island.

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.320
They look and act just like humans.

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:03.290
Do no one can tell the difference.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.630
On the night before the full moon,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:06.690
every mermaid shows an

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.710
eight-pointed star mark on their body.

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:11.630
Before the full moon night?

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:12.730
- Yes.
- Yeah.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.020
Did you get a tattoo?

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.820
If they stay in human form

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.610
for too long,

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.410
marks begin to appear on their bodies,

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:37.440
like tattoos.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:39.880
Before the full moon night.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.570
Those marks I mentioned

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.280
are a warning.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.450
It means their blood is turning poisonous.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.850
And during that time,

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:50.890
they must not mate with anyone.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:55.110
They have to dive deep into the ocean

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:57.000
on the night of the full moon

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.300
and cleanse their blood with coral.

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:02.730
If they don't,

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:05.450
they'll be trapped in mermen form forever.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.310
Mr. Phurit.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.570
If I tell you the truth,

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.290
can you promise me one thing?

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.730
Promise you won't leave me.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:43.970
Honestly,

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.840
I'd love to see you swim, Ping.

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:48.590
You'd be beautiful.

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:53.750
What's the matter?

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:57.170
That's strange.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.710
Never thought I'd hear something like this.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.820
I used to think of myself as a monster.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.990
From now on, don't think that again.

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:13.520
To me,

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.580
you're the most beautiful thing.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.790
And I want you to see yourself that way too.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.690
When you called my mom
and told her you found me…

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.880
did she say anything?

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.090
She just kept thanking me.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.780
I told her to go home and rest,

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:49.780
and I'd bring you home tomorrow.

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:57.270
What's on your mind?

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:01.410
I don't know.

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:04.360
I don't know if I can believe it.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.560
Ever since my dad died,

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.190
my mom and I have grown more distant.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.710
In the past,

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:15.520
it always felt like she found me disgusting.

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:22.900
I don't know
what happened between you two,

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.260
but I believe that from now on,

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:29.630
she's not the same person she was before.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.130
Thank you.

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:34.510
What's going on, Phu?

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.060
What happened, Phu?

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.060
You knew that Nawa's a merman, right?

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.110
Yeah. You found out already?

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:05.150
Then why the hell didn't you tell me?

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:07.550
Why not?

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.200
- Why?
- Mr. Phurit, please calm down!

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.370
I can't calm down, Ping!

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:17.040
Why, Phana?

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.080
What the hell am I to you?

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.640
You're my friend, you idiot!

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:22.860
Friend?

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.970
A friend wouldn't do this!

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:29.580
If I had told you that Nawa's a merman,

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.600
would you have believed me?

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:33.660
Even if you did,

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.460
do you think revealing this

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:38.620
won't have any repercussions?

00:25:40.035 --> 00:25:48.035

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:42.730
Phu,

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:45.530
I get it.

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:48.170
But you need to calm down.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:54.280
Ping,

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:57.460
give us a moment.

00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:59.380
Okay.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.060
Come here. Calm down.

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:13.450
Sit down.

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:19.760
I promise

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.680
I'll tell you everything.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:25.630
But first

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.060
tell me what happened.

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:32.990
Nawa and I were together all day.

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:38.030
Then suddenly, a few hours ago,

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.900
Nawa started acting strange,

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:44.310
like he was sick.

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.070
He said

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:50.120
he had to go out right away.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.500
Are you not feeling well?

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:57.630
Tonight…
there's somewhere I need to go.

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:01.250
Where? Let me go with you.

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:05.020
It's fine.

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:09.000
I'll be quick, I'll come right back.

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:11.870
Then out of nowhere,

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:15.440
Phraphai showed up and took Nawa with him.

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.010
Phraphai, calm down first.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.200
You're going to kill Nawa.

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:23.920
Phraphai.

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:25.960
My father just passed away today.

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:28.120
I can't lose you too.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.440
I followed them to the beach.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.150
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:47.900
And I saw everything, Phana.

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:01.420
I'm sorry

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.620
for keeping this from you all this time.

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:09.970
Part of what's happening, it's my fault too.

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:16.270
I've known Nawa since we were kids.

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:23.020
His parents worked for my family.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.010
When the resort first opened,

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:27.920
We knew from the start

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.220
that his family were merfolk.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:34.410
But we never feared

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.490
or despised them.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.590
We even helped hide it.

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:50.320
But 20 years ago,

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:55.570
humans started hunting mermen.

00:28:57.810 --> 00:28:59.940
Some to sell in the black market,

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.860
some kill out of hatred.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.070
This act of cruelty

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.250
victimized Nawa's parents.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.620
Since I was a child,
I was instilled with the idea that

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:19.860
I must protect Nawa like my own brother.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.390
That's why I stopped you two

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:27.320
from being together.

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:31.500
Even though we're close,

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:34.750
I was terrified of

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:38.250
what would happen if you found out.

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:42.860
I didn't want you to get hurt.

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:45.980
I didn't want my brother to get hurt.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.460
But after experiencing it,

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.270
my mindset has changed too.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:02.860
Yes, Ping's a merman too.

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:05.970
If you're angry,

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:08.650
if you hate us for it

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.850
I understand.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:19.840
You know what?

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:26.220
This is the first time in my life
I don't know what to think.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.370
I don't even know

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:35.220
what I want anymore.

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:58.500
When I got home…
my father already passed away.

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:01.720
And it was all because of humans.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.530
I didn't know what to do.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.740
It felt like I'd lost everything.

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:20.680
I'm really sorry…

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:22.920
about Uncle Chan.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.550
Nawa,

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.100
my father's death

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:39.120
made me realize something,

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.240
I can't lose someone I love ever again.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.060
Especially not you, Nawa.

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:50.420
No matter what, I'll protect you.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:57.780
Nawa…

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.380
Please,

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:03.070
from now on,

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.970
come live with me.

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:11.680
I promise,
I'll take care of you with everything I have.

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:29.360
I know you love Phurit a lot,

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:34.160
but there's something you should know,

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:38.920
when he saw what we really are,

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:43.110
he was terrified.
He ran away from us.

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:46.080
He looked at us like we were monsters.

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:55.380
I don't ever want to see anyone
look at you that way again.

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.330
I tried to keep it from Phurit.

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.580
I thought maybe one day, if I was ready,

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:16.980
I'd tell him everything.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:22.760
But it's too late now I guess.

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.560
He probably doesn't even want
to see me anymore.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:38.340
No human could ever truly love
a mermen like us.

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:50.520
So from now on, I'll live with you.

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:04.430
It's okay.

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:09.090
I'll take care of you.

00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:30.480
Everything's going to be fine, trust me.

00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:35.180
I won't go in with you

00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:38.190
because I wanted you and your mom
to have some time together.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:40.710
Okay.

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:43.510
You should go back and check on Phurit.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.370
What about Phana? He's not joining us?

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:37.940
He had something to take care of.

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:43.620
Sit down,
I just have one last dish to finish.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.070
If I could make just one wish…

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:55.140
I wish I could have a meal
with Mom happily just once.

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:18.540
Eat it before it gets cold.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.310
I couldn't remember what you liked,

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:28.930
so I made a bit of everything.

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:35.190
I can eat anything, Mom.

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:49.300
Mom…

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:51.800
Hmm?

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:55.400
For the things I said before,

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.230
I'm sorry.

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:03.790
It's okay.

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.240
If I were you,

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:08.110
I might've done the same.

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.670
But I want you to know something.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.800
No matter what happened,

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.490
I never wanted to kill you.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:26.660
Because you're my son after all.

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:30.850
In the past,

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:35.530
I was the one
who failed to be a good mother.

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:39.740
Ping.

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:45.280
Can I ask you for something?

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:50.430
Please give me another chance

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:55.810
to be your mom properly, just once.

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:25.540
It must have been so hard
for you all this time.

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:30.080
I'm sorry.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:31.940
I'm so sorry.

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:36.090
I love you, my son.

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:45.410
I love you too, Mom.

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:13.550
Damn it, Phu.

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:17.450
At least take a shower first.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.290
I already told everyone
the bar's closed today.

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:24.700
If you want to drink yourself stupid,
go ahead.

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:31.700
Phana, hello.

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:33.790
Phraphai.

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:36.730
I saw your car outside, so I came in.

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:38.540
There's something important
I need to tell you.

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:40.430
Something important?

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:43.950
From now on,
Nawa won't be working here anymore.

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.640
He asked me to tell you himself.

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.960
He had to quit?

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:55.770
I believe Mr. Phurit has already
told you what happened.

00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.190
After everything,

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:02.880
Nawa's decided he won't hide
his identity anymore.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.940
He's choosing to live with his own kind.

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:07.970
Nawa's going to stay with me.

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:12.570
Wait, Phraphai,

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:15.000
I want Nawa to talk to me
about this himself.

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:17.140
My father passed away recently…

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:19.690
and it was all because of humans.

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.490
I don't want that kind of tragedy
to happen to my people ever again.

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:26.160
What? Headman Chan passed away?

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:27.610
Yes.

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:30.850
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:33.290
Just please understand me.

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.730
Nawa deserves to be
with someone who can protect him,

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:40.810
not someone who hurt him.

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:49.770
Anyway, thank you,

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:52.420
for taking such good care
of him all this time.

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.170
And you...

00:40:57.690 --> 00:40:59.240
But from now on, let's live separately.

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:02.180
Stay out of Nawa's life.

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:05.120
If you don't, I'll collide into you.

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:12.310
Now, if you'll excuse me.

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:25.600
Are you okay?

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.580
I'll always have your back, headman.

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:51.490
Thanks, man.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.860
Hey, Nawa…

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:09.610
Do you think I'll be good enough
to lead the merfolk?

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:16.020
I believe you will.

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:18.410
Just like Uncle Chan did.

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:27.340
What's wrong?

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:31.070
Nothing, really.

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:39.680
From now on, we'll have to
face a lot more than before.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.270
I don't know if I'll be able
to handle it.

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:51.450
But I believe that

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:54.860
as long as I have you by my side,

00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:57.480
I can get through anything.

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:01.100
Nawa,

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:04.220
I want you beside me, always.

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:11.010
Hmm?

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:43.680
Is there was something I could do for him?

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.020
I hate seeing him like this.

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:50.320
There's nothing we can do right now.

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:53.680
We don't even know what Phurit's thinking

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:55.290
or feeling.

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:57.790
Maybe…

00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:00.010
he's trying to find his own answers.

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:02.250
Right.

00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:07.380
Let time do its work, Phana.

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:46.340
I was just about to head into town for a bit.

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:48.510

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:54.430
(Love each other.)

00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:58.200
(Complicated.)

00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:01.630
(My world.)

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:05.580
(A new world together.)

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:09.560
(Couple.)

00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:14.060
(What is important?)

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:20.500
(as long as we love each other.)

00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:28.920
(underline it as forbidden love.)

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:36.040
♪ that I... ♪

00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:52.290
Oh, Ping, where's Phana?

00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:54.220
Accompanying the guests at the shop.

00:49:58.310 --> 00:49:59.840
It's been a few days now.

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:01.710
How have you been, Mr. Phurit?

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:04.610
I'm not sure.

00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:08.370
There are a lot of emotions.

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.420
But the clearest one is

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:16.640
longing.

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:23.080
Can I ask you something directly?

00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:28.250
Are you afraid of or disgusted by mermen?

00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:32.660
Not at all, Ping.

00:50:34.770 --> 00:50:36.010
I'll be honest,

00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:38.900
I was shocked

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:41.410
when I found out the truth,

00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:46.540
because I never believed in
things like this before.

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:52.860
But now I understand,
and I accept that they exist.

00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:56.640
I'm not scared or disgusted in any way.

00:50:59.110 --> 00:51:02.550
Then what about Nawa?
What do you think about him?

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:07.360
Even though I'm not afraid
or disgusted that Nawa is a merman,

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:12.310
I just don't know how to
handle this relationship.

00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:16.650
I don't know what's appropriate
and in appropriate,

00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:19.430
right or wrong anymore

00:51:23.770 --> 00:51:26.040
especially since Nawa decided
to live with his own kind.

00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:30.600
You'll never truly know

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:32.890
how he feels unless you

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:34.620
hear it from him directly.

00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:36.740
And about what you said

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:39.020
that you don't know how to
handle the relationship

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:40.770
that's not strange at all.

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:44.130
My mother felt the same way.

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.790
In the past...

00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:52.840
I used to think she hated me
because I was a merman.

00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:56.380
But after we talked, I understood that

00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:59.560
she just didn't know how to deal
with the fact that her son was one.

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:02.500
Even now,

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:06.770
I still don't know how to deal
with all this.

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:11.400
But one thing I do know
is how much I love you, my son.

00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:16.210
I love you, Ping.

00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:21.310
I can't bear to lose you.

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.110
Then let's start over again, Mom.

00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:37.460
You have to ask yourself,

00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:40.670
do you love Nawa enough?

00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:43.970
Because if you can't stand
the thought of losing him,

00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:47.970
then stop worrying about
how to handle the relationship.

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:49.940
Sometimes,

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:52.630
feelings have to come before reason.

00:52:57.070 --> 00:52:57.950
Mr. Phurit.

00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:00.520
If I tell you the truth,

00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:03.090
can you promise me one thing?

00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:06.560
Promise you won't leave me.

00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:09.880
Nawa…

00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:13.040
I don't know

00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:15.990
what you're about to tell me,

00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:21.140
but I promise

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.640
I'll stay by your side no matter what.

00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:32.090
And one more thing,
I truly believe that if Nawa had a choice,

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:34.740
he'd still want to live his life with you.

00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:43.160
Thank you, Ping.
You made me realize something.

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:48.100
The rest is up to you now, Mr. Phurit.

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:56.760
Have you ever seen one, then?

00:53:58.670 --> 00:54:00.000
For this question,

00:54:00.730 --> 00:54:02.730
I'll answer that question the day you truly

00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:04.540
believe mermen exist.

00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:15.820
I think I know now, Ping.

00:54:57.550 --> 00:54:58.440
Why are you here?

00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:00.560
I know the truth now.

00:55:02.130 --> 00:55:03.400
Where did you take Nawa?

00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:06.130
You really want to know?

00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:08.780
Then step over my dead body first.

00:55:29.170 --> 00:55:31.010
(Love each other.)

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:34.760
(Complicated.)

00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:38.280
(My world.)

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:41.850
(A new world together.)

00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:50.250
(underline it as forbidden love.)

00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:52.710
(Next Episode)
If Nawa and I truly can't be together,

00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:55.840
then that decision should be ours

00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:57.510
not anyone else's.

00:55:57.930 --> 00:56:01.020
You really think this problem
is that simple to fix?

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.570
You called for me, headman.
What do you need me to do?

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:09.520
Take this information to
the humans who hunt mermen.

00:56:10.210 --> 00:56:13.280
Once they kill the mermen,
make sure you kill the humans too.

00:56:14.410 --> 00:56:15.380
Leave no evidence behind.

00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:27.260
Grandpa Samut, please help Mr. Phurit!
I don't know what's happening to him!

00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.390
This man has been poisoned
by a merman's poison.

00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:30.790
To save him,

00:56:30.930 --> 00:56:34.140
he must drink the blood
from a merman's heart.

00:56:35.610 --> 00:56:37.310
I hope what I'm about to do

00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:41.370
can repay the love you've given me.

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:44.550
I love you, Mr. Phurit.
