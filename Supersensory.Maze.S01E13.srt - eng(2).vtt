00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.640
Society is essentially
a collective of people,

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.710
rather than people themselves.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.510
Human nature inherently contains

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.710
the animal's beastly instincts.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.960
We should return to nature.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.220
The difference
between society and nature

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.000
lies in the fact
that society has certain

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.350
moral objectives.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.320
As long as one is still human,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.000
there is no escape

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.640
from symbiosis in biology.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.670
Just like you and me right now.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.560
Symbiosis in psychology

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.670
does not refer to a mutually beneficial

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.280
and dependent relationship,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.320
but rather a mutually reliant

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.520
and destructive one.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.140
Let's go.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.990
It's time.

Ms. Zhao,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.250
please cooperate with our work.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.030
Captain He.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.030
Are you in charge here?

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.120
Yes.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.240
I don't understand.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.630
I saved someone bravely.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.360
Why am I being suspected?

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.800
We just spoke

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.740
with the traffic police

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.730
and the hospital.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.850
We know you are the witness

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:31.880
who reported the case.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.940
You're here just to answer
some questions.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.800
Let me take a look.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.250
The wound is not deep.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.190
Do you know who called the ambulance?

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.960
It seems to be a lady

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.400
named Zhao Xin.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.950
I don't know anything else.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.680
That's impossible.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.630
So, it really was you who took it.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.360
Sorry about that.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.240
It happened so suddenly.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.510
My thoughts are a bit scattered.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.240
Could you try to recall?

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.280
At the scene of the accident,

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.630
did you notice anything?

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.470
Suspicious people,

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.150
or suspicious vehicles?

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.520
When I got there,

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.590
the car had overturned.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.000
I was waiting at a red light.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.630
But it seems

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.680
there was a car

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.240
that drove past there.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.840
Did you see the driver?

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.680
No, I didn't get a clear look.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.190
The license plate number seemed

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.080
to be 4, something, 7, 7, and 4.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.560
4722.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:02.560
4722.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.680
Why? Isn't this

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.840
just an ordinary accident?

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.140
It is still under investigation.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.280
Thanks for your cooperation today.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.250
If you remember anything later,

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.240
feel free to contact us.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.120
Okay.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.030
Then please,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.160
come here and sign.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.390
Leave your contact info.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.620
- Here?
- Yes.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.230
By the way, Ms. Zhao,

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.600
I wonder if you saw the lady

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.800
you saved when you went
to the hospital.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.380
(Signed by: Zhao Xin)

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.320
She should be very grateful to you.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.710
Where is the thing I asked for?

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.040
With this,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.920
you can get the truth you want

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.160
and also deal with Mai Boyuan.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.170
Did you change your mind?

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.920
Businessmen value integrity the most.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.560
How could I do that?

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.910
It's just

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.000
a small bit of extra demand.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.750
A last-minute demand. How phony.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.870
I am

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:30.360
timid.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.870
I fear death.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.870
You were once a cop.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.920
I'm scared of you now.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.310
Why don't you assure me?

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:42.870
Kill him,

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.240
and I'll give you the ledger.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:50.950
Are you joking, Mr. Hou?

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.310
Helping a good citizen like me

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.630
sleep soundly

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.560
is the responsibility of the police.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.310
Thanks for taking me for a walk.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.480
We don't think

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.240
this is a simple traffic accident.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.410
The traffic police examined the scene.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.390
It should be an intentional murder.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.270
Think carefully.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.600
Is there any enemy

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.600
or suspect?

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.400
I don't know.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.600
It was too dark to see clearly.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.120
It seems like there was someone.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.430
It looked like a woman.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.870
Did you lose anything?

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.460
No.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.720
My subordinates have checked.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.070
We will check

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.920
the dashcam in the car

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.420
and the surveillance along the road.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.270
We'll naturally know

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.360
what happened.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.110
Got it.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.720
Thanks, Officer He.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.720
He's a man.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.270
Not a chicken.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.870
I just want the truth.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.430
I don't want to get

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:39.660
deeper and deeper into this.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.190
Why should I kill anyone?

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.920
Boring.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.720
If you don't want to do it,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.600
is there anything else

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.240
we can trade?

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.390
I have what you want.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.510
I know where the money

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.750
Xu Yi embezzled

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.870
from the clubhouse is hidden.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.190
I planned to surprise you

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.680
with that after the deal

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.760
was done tonight.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.510
One useful person

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.830
is enough.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:30.840
Show

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.000
Mr. Xu

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.080
our sincerity.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.000
Mr. Hou, Mr. Hou.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.280
Mr. Hou.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.710
Mr. Hou, Mr. Hou.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.120
Don't you want to look

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:56.000
at what I have?

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.910
Mai Boyuan.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.320
What a surprise.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.200
I got you again.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:32.750
My patience is limited.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:34.440
Though you withdrew

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.600
from the Central Road Project,

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.360
you can't go anywhere

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:38.790
without my consent.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.320
As long as you're still in Wuyang,

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.360
you can't escape from my grasp.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.270
I'll give you the last three days

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.000
to hand over the USB drive.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.670
I want the goods there

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:15.420
within three days.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.510
Is there any problem?

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.990
I know.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.070
Don't worry.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.550
I will send the goods on time.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:22.750
Okay

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:23.940
I trust you.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.750
After this order, don't call me again.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.790
What did Mai Boyuan do to offend you?

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.120
Why betray him without hesitation?

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.150
Do you know what these photos mean

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.510
to Gao?

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:40.710
Forget about him.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.630
Aren't you afraid that I'll move

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.320
once I get the photos?

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:48.630
At most,

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:49.960
he's just a client.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.550
I'd be foolish to risk my life

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.440
for a client.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.870
You just asked me

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.200
if I was afraid.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.870
The photos are just a greeting gift.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.270
Since I just gave them to you,

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:08.720
that means

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:11.720
I have something even better.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.840
As for Zhao Xin,

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.510
she entrusted me to deal with you.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.200
The goal is the USB drive.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.840
After I decrypt it, I'll give it to her.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:22.720
As for you...

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.150
Your life doesn't matter.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.150
What a wench.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.270
She'd wish I could die.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.240
After I hooked her up with Mai Boyuan,

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.120
she wants to get rid of me.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:41.710
What a wench.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:43.630
How about this?

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.150
Once I decrypt

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:46.150
that USB drive,

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.760
I'll hand it over to you.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:52.630
Untie Mr. Zhuang now.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.440
You just said

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.320
one useful person is enough,

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.160
right?

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.440
So, his life

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.270
belongs to me, right?

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.320
After all, I've never been a cop.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.510
I don't have those boring moral burdens.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.540
(Auction Item Shipping List)

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.620
(See the signature page later)

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.440
Send the latest order out

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.360
as soon as possible.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.560
Is that so?

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.000
Maybe I forgot.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.670
Put that page in a safe place.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:39.670
Hello, Mr. Gao?

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:42.350
Here's the thing.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.670
About that USB drive,

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:46.510
I have some new info.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.360
I'd like to talk to you privately.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.720
Sure, see you tomorrow, Mr. Gao.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:53.690
I'll be waiting for you.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.960
In this world,

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:05.750
money always works.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.750
The terms you both offered are good.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.120
Actually, I want them all.

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:20.240
Is it possible

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:22.270
for both of you to work for me?

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.390
I'd gain an extra boost then.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.320
- No way.
- No way.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.480
It seems Mr. Hou

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.440
wasn't taken advantage of too badly.

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:36.470
To be honest,

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:38.150
I can trust

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.390
neither of you.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.550
Since you're so hesitant,

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.080
I'll make a choice for you.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.750
Though it's about doing business,

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.120
you can't just come and leave

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.240
whenever you want.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.200
I am Party A.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.840
I want to do business

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:04.000
with both of you.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:06.590
It's okay.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.440
Only one can be alive.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.280
Mr. Xu,

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.120
you didn't choose just now,

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.320
so you can't blame me now

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.120
for leaving you with no choice.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:36.840
We'll have to see

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.240
what you're capable of.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.640
Let's make it clear first.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.240
I have to get

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.390
the thing in his hands first.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.630
Only then will his life be yours.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.030
The money is hidden

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.550
in a locker at Leyun Gym.

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:04.930
- Enter.
- What's wrong?

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.550
You and Liu Ming go check

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:07.910
the car with the tail number 4722.

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:09.110
Copy that.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:11.470
Liu Ming,

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:12.510
field work.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:14.920
Let's go.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.200
When strangled to this extent,

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.200
it'll only take 12 hours

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.030
for his nerves to die.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.630
Which locker is it exactly?

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.080
Zone A.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.390
2345.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.030
The password

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.910
is 345751.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.200
The round trip takes 3 hours.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.390
We need to hurry.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.270
Hou Liangyuan,

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.440
if I lose my leg,

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.000
I'll fight you to the bitter end.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.790
If this USB drive isn't decrypted

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.240
before the money isn't retrieved,

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:15.510
you know what your fate will be, right?

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:20.190
Cheers.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.090
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.850
It's a car with a cloned plate.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.550
The trail has gone cold again.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:41.550
You didn't expect that, did you?

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.310
You did so much.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.030
They still don't believe you.

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:45.880
Hurry up.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.920
I still want to keep this leg.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.750
Why must he

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.270
solve problems with violence?

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:54.920
Can you crack it or not?

00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:59.200
36 cm.

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.910
36 cm.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:05.100
Captain He,
the village secretary is here.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:08.630
Record this.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:09.670
Seal it off.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.110
How was it discovered?

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:17.960
The rainstorm some time ago

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:19.540
might've washed away the soil.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.850
When the kids came to play,

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:21.590
they discovered it.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.440
So,

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.510
we called the police.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.880
Can you tell me

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:26.440
what the situation is with this family?

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:28.160
Their surname is Hou.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.310
The couple had died long ago.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.550
They had only one son
named Hou Liangyuan.

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:34.310
Over a decade ago, he went out to work

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:35.270
and never came back.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.510
This house has been vacant ever since.

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:38.790
Does Hou Liangyuan have

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:39.920
any other relatives?

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:41.440
Just his parents and him.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.200
His father was named Hou Guanhuang.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.350
A native of the village.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:45.790
His mother came from another village.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.310
Her name...

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:48.150
Jiang Yumei.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.160
Yes.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.960
She came
from the neighboring Lujia Village.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.960
What is the relationship

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.220
between Jiang Yumei and Jiang Yongquan?

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.240
Jiang Yumei is Jiang Yongquan's aunt.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:05.590
Do you know more

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:06.440
about Hou Liangyuan?

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:09.000
Well,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.070
when he was 18,

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.410
he had a serious illness.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.720
After that, he became fat.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.020
Was he very thin before?

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.750
Not thin, just average.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.280
Disgusting?

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.310
Don't listen to their principles.

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:36.920
One used to be a teacher;

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:38.440
one studied abroad.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.160
In the end, they fell

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.240
into my hands.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:44.720
Once under my command,

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.400
you must work steadily

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.500
and devote yourself to me.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:50.880
If you're beyond control,

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.000
I'd rather kill you.

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:54.670
Am I right or not?

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:56.670
Right.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.110
In this world,

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.350
there's no one you can trust.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.310
You can only trust yourself.

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:05.790
They're like a pair of pet dogs,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.350
locked in a cage.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.040
In the end,

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:12.350
they will bite each other

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:14.200
to stay alive.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.640
Can we still make it out alive?

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:27.760
Are you scared?

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.110
You know this better than I do.

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:37.790
You helped me control them.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:40.110
Do you remember when you first arrived?

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:42.720
You weren't like this.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.000
This is the key to the room.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:52.440
Keep a close watch on them.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.510
Don't let me down.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.830
Have you cracked it?

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.200
The computer is handling

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.110
the rest.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.040
Chef.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:18.720
Hacker.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.920
Biologist.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.240
So much expertise.

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.270
Knowledge is just an illusion
created by humans.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.400
It becomes boring
after you understand it.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:36.400
Knowledge is not just

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.270
an understanding of things.

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:42.550
More importantly,
it is the insight into humans.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.200
You look

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:57.720
quite disappointed.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.550
You're such a genius.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.790
Why not do something better?

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:09.270
What a pity.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:15.510
When a person

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.720
encounters a beast,

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:19.310
no matter who dies,

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.640
it is the law of nature.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.070
But when they are placed

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.960
inside a cage

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.440
and forced to kill,

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.830
the cruel truth

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.400
just emerges.

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:33.790
Your point is

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:37.270
that violence itself is not cruel.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:38.790
What is cruel is

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:40.640
the collective violence

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:43.200
after a set of rules is established.

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.550
So, what I want to do is

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:57.350
kill all the rules.

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:02.550
You just want

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:03.960
the right to interpret the rules.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:17.400
Have you found the exact location?

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.240
Based on the tracker

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.200
you hid in Xu's amulet,

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.040
the exact location is

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.950
(Location captured)
in the Guanghua Road area.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:23.190
Most buildings are abandoned.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.590
(Safe travels)
Captain He,

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:25.920
why send Xu to be the undercover?

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.270
Why didn't you tell me?

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.040
Sit.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:33.630
Continue.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:36.070
The DNA results are out.

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:37.030
It's Hou Liangyuan.

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:38.350
The Hou Liangyuan now

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:39.510
is actually Jiang Yongquan,

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:40.550
the culprit at large

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:41.740
of the "8·19" trafficking case

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:42.580
30 years ago.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.820
So, after Jiang Yongquan

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.460
(Identity: Hou Liangyuan)
fled that year,

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.500
he went to his aunt's home

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:48.610
and somehow became

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:49.510
his cousin,

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:50.440
Hou Liangyuan.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.310
How did

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:53.440
the real Hou Liangyuan die?

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.310
We're still waiting

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:55.300
for the result from M.E.

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.350
Are you sure it's Jiang Yongquan?

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.790
It's a perfect match.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.800
It is Jiang Yongquan.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.210
It's finally confirmed.

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:04.240
Xu Jingzhi

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.030
was abducted to Lujia Village.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:07.720
The main abductor

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:09.270
is Jiang Yongquan.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.440
Don't you have anyone you hate?

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:23.440
You'd hate them so much

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.160
that you'd want to kill them.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.280
No.

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:29.350
Lu Ran told me

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:30.780
you were abducted there

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:32.170
when you were a kid.

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:33.880
Don't you hate

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:34.720
the abductor?

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:35.880
Not worth it.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.200
Growing up has always been

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.400
a painful process.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:41.720
Hatred

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:46.160
is not the only coping method,

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:50.270
nor should it be the driving force

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:51.790
for people like us to keep on living.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.440
So, during that period,

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.640
was there nothing worth your nostalgia?

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:06.720
At least, there were things

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.160
that were both special and fun.

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:13.200
For example,

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:16.790
in an unfamiliar environment,

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.440
you could become good friends with a dog

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:24.350
and play some thrilling games

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.930
that involve jaywalking.

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:28.680
You could even raise

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.550
a paranoid monster.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.070
I was abducted
while eating lamb chop noodles.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.070
Then I was sold to Lujia Village.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.750
The man in that family was Lu Youcheng.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.640
I still like eating lamb chop noodles.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.070
Four times a month.

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:10.070
I was too young at that time.

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:11.440
I let you test Wu Min

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.400
with the rice cake she hates the most

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.790
to see if she was really crazy,

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:17.160
but I overlooked

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.440
the psychological harm it'd cause you.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:25.440
In Lujia Village,

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.400
Wu Min has always protected you.

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:29.150
She let me

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.030
escape safely.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.960
If only I weren't there.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:36.350
Have you ever thought

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:38.000
about killing me?

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.310
If we can get out alive...

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.940
(Zone A)

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.660
(Zhen Yuandao)

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:12.420
(File Folder)

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:13.920
This is the surprise you mentioned.

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:19.790
It seems our understanding of surprises

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:21.440
is quite different.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.310
He told me

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:29.750
that you need multiple identities

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:30.880
as a precaution.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.240
What is this for?

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:46.200
It can open a room worth 30 million.

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.850
Address?

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:51.440
My leg feels uncomfortable.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.270
Your leg is fine.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.440
You're just hungry.

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.830
You can even starve for another week.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.070
Wasn't Xu Yi's clubhouse

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:28.440
sealed off?

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.720
I can still get in.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.640
What am I going there to look for?

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.790
You alone can put it there.

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.720
So, it's definitely not cash.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.160
A suitcase.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.790
1,000 bank cards.

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:50.720
Xu Yi laundered the money

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:52.110
with the clumsiest method.

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:53.880
30,000 on one card.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:55.830
No one checks.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.000
Then I'll send someone again.

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:04.790
If it's still

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.790
this kind of surprise,

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:10.190
I don't have

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.960
your sense

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:12.800
of humor.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.560
Hou,

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.590
it's been found.

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:22.880
He's given me what I want.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.590
Have you decrypted the USB drive?

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.510
The deal is over.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.070
We each take what we need.

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:50.000
You've fallen into my hands.

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:52.200
Now, you are

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:53.920
under my control.

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:55.430
And you.

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:01.150
Take the computer.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.920
Did you get the USB drive?

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:04.630
On the surface,

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:05.850
I don't have an identity

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:07.030
to approach Hou Liangyuan.

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:08.030
(Three days ago)

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:08.870
I do.

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:10.960
Your appearance increases credibility.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:12.440
After it's done,

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:14.600
we each take what we need.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:17.920
You'd better make good use of me.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.260
Nice to work with you.

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:22.170
Nice to work with you.

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:24.630
You're half-siblings.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.320
Though you have different surnames,

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.840
it's not hard to investigate you.

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:31.760
What do you want me to do?

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:38.760
First,

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.360
give this to Hou Liangyuan.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.730
I'll go find him in several days.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:48.110
Try to install the listening device

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:50.010
(Bill; Recorder: Zhao Xueli)
in his office.

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:51.390
Second,

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:53.590
after I enter the resort,

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.320
stop his lackeys from searching me.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.960
Try to hand this over to me.

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:01.950
Be smart.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.330
Don't let anyone find out.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.150
Third,

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:10.670
send Hou Liangyuan

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:12.070
to his

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:13.320
secret passage.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.280
Hou is strict.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:16.800
How will you get in?

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.630
That has nothing to do with you.

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:21.440
Fourth,

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.920
find someone in the resort

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.150
to work for me.

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:30.030
Do you understand?

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.710
What did your helper leave you?

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:56.030
What's going on?

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:58.510
This is ruthless.

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:09.820
