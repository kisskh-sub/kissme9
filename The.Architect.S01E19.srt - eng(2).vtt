Why don't you kill him?

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:25.679
You're right.

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:28.480
Taking his life

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.600
would be easy.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.159
But were he to die now,

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:34.439
the best outcome is that

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.079
the Prince Duan's Residence
would merely vanish.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.280
And the Shen family's grievances

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.840
would fade into oblivion

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.000
as they vanish.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.240
I want him alive.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.359
To let the world see

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:51.320
his hypocrisy and cruelty.

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.119
To watch him fall from the clouds
into the deepest mire.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.560
Let's go home.

(Xi Yan is Shen Changning)

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.520
Miss,

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:24.560
you've not eaten anything for two days.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.960
Your body cannot sustain this.

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:30.400
I have no appetite.

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:32.840
Miss.

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:35.175
Rumor has it Prince Duan's treasury

00:02:35.612 --> 00:02:37.742
was emptied without a trace.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.000
They have no clue at all.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.840
Xiao Huaijin is so mad

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.000
that he flogged

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.560
all his servants in a rage.

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:50.400
Miss,

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:52.639
did you ask someone to do that?

00:02:57.919 --> 00:02:58.560
I...

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:04.120
Governor.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.919
Xiao Huaijin is the Prince

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.080
and holds great power.

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.960
I fear

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.199
he may strike against Miss again.

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:16.280
Though we spared him for now,

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:18.759
he shall know no peace.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.840
Even the fiercest beast

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.520
feels dread.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.039
You're right.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.719
Xiao Huaijin

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.840
has his demons.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.120
Help!

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.319
Help!

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:40.759
Help!

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:42.280
Unfilial son!

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.199
Unfilial son!

Pay with your life!

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:54.280
(Patricide and usurpation.)

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.759
(Heaven will strike you down.)

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:23.839
Beast!

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.319
You are unfit to bear my title!

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.480
Kneel and repent!

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:32.680
Why should I?

00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:34.959
Why should I?

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.240
If you could do it,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.480
why can I not?

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.839
You are old.

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:42.937
Why would you not spare me?

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.040
I

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:48.879
- shall kill you first!
- Don't come near me.

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:50.720
Don't come near me!

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:53.360
Don't come near me!

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.120
Your Highness!

00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:00.120
Your Highness!

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:01.399
Are you fine?

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:22.040
His guilty conscience

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:24.399
plagues his sleep.

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:27.319
I shall ensure he remains restless.

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:31.920
Chunyun get someone
to send me some words.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
I finally know

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.920
why we cannot find Yunqi.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.839
Xiao Huaijin hid him from the start.

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:41.199
He bought Yunqi,

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:43.680
and spreads false news

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.879
to blind us.

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:47.759
Since we released information,

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:50.800
he surely plans a spectacle.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.120
Once he makes his move,

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:55.639
I shall have the chance to save Yunqi.

Sit.

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:48.560
Recently,

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.360
rumors of hauntings in

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:52.950
the Prince Duan's Residence
are widespread.

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:56.000
It seems

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.600
the rumors are true.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.680

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.439
but for you, Princess.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.240
How so?

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.040
Shen Changning is alive.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.079
Xi Yan is Shen Changning.

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:28.399
Shen Changning is dead.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.800
Everyone knows this.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.800
It seems you have truly gone mad.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.319
I've sent someone to check.

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:36.639
I have found a loose end.

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:38.560
Young Master of
the Shen family, Shen Yunqi.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.160
Someone else

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.160
seeks his whereabouts.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.360
Someone from the Shen family.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.519
Who else

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:50.759
but Shen Changning

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.279
would care for

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:54.360
that child?

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.519
Whether she lives or dies

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.399
is your concern.

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:02.400
What does it has to do with me?

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.439
Your Highness,

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.639
do you not wish to kill Xi Yan?

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:20.040
(Impossible.)

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.879
(How would Yu knows Shen Changning?)

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.399
(I've known Shen Changning since young.)

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.439
(Yet, she never mentioned him.)

00:08:28.959 --> 00:08:29.720
Yu.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.000
Do not touch what is mine
without permission.

00:08:46.879 --> 00:08:47.919
I remember,

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.000
Mr. Pei were at odds with Lady Xi Yan.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.279
But now,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.480
you are together.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.320
Your Majesty, you may not know.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.759
Xi Yan entered Prince Duan's Residence

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.320
as Governor's concubine.

00:09:02.039 --> 00:09:03.559
Served two husbands.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.159
She is popular indeed.

00:09:06.639 --> 00:09:07.840
Your Highness, I must disagree.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.159
There was merely

00:09:10.159 --> 00:09:11.320
a misunderstanding between us.

00:09:11.799 --> 00:09:13.399
Now that it's resolved,

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.039
we are naturally reconciled.

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:22.600
If the misunderstanding

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:24.159
is cleared, then good.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.360
Mr. Pei,

00:09:25.759 --> 00:09:26.279
Prince Duan,

00:09:27.039 --> 00:09:28.919
you are both pillars of the state.

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:31.159
I wish for

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.559
no discord between you.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:36.879
Governor Pei,

00:09:37.879 --> 00:09:39.200
there was misunderstanding

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:40.240
between us.

00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:41.759
I was ignorant

00:09:41.879 --> 00:09:42.919
of the rules before.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.679
I hope Governor would forgive me.

00:09:46.639 --> 00:09:47.519
From this day forth,

00:09:48.039 --> 00:09:49.399
our grievances

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.320
are erased.

00:09:50.879 --> 00:09:51.519
We shall

00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:52.840
serve His Majesty together.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.840
Your Highness, you're skilled.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.080
His Majesty loves these blooms.

00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:13.799
Every time he looks at them,

00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:15.600
he'd be so glad.

00:10:16.879 --> 00:10:17.840
This harem

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.200
is like these flowers.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.200
Seemingly lush,

00:10:21.879 --> 00:10:23.159
but each branch has its thought.

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:25.039
Tangled deeply with
the branch before it.

00:10:26.039 --> 00:10:27.559
Yu's actions, though sometimes forced,

00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:28.840
are to help me

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.480
stand firm here.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.360
You are siblings.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.720
You should support one another.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.919
Too bad.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.519
To make the flowers bloom better,

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:47.000
and flourish,

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.360
one must prune ruthlessly.

00:10:50.039 --> 00:10:50.919
To keep this one,

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.000
that one must be cut.

00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:55.720
I ponder daily

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.279
how to manage it all

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.440
perfectly?

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:01.759
Your Highness, tea is served.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.559
I get the Royal Kitchen
to bake some seasonal pastries.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.440
Taste it.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:08.679
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:16.360
Here.

00:11:16.919 --> 00:11:17.639
Taste this.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:32.300
(Do you want to know
where your brother is?)

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.679
Why are you here?

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.480
Where is Shen Yunqi?

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:47.639
Xi Yan.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.960
Your hands are cold.

00:12:02.679 --> 00:12:03.559
The wind is rising.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.000
Let's go back.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.039
(Shen Changning.)

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.200
(Xi Yan.)

00:12:15.679 --> 00:12:16.960
(You're the same person)

00:12:20.425 --> 00:12:22.425
(End of Episode)

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.399
My hands are also stained with blood.

00:12:26.159 --> 00:12:28.320
I am a ghost bearing a blood feud.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.519
You and I
