00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.900
I thought I was dreaming.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.130
Try this.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.130
It's good.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.850
Really?

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.010
Too sweet!

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.530
I'm hopeless in the kitchen.

00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:31.060
I was craving something sweet.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.570
That's too sweet.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.250
I'll get some water.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.780
It's fine.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:41.780
Don't worry about it.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.530
Go home.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.100
What's up?

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.120
If you stay too long,

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.511
your mom's going to be unhappy.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.850
She won't.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.470
She already packed up

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.690
and went home in a huff.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.340
I've made things clear with her.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.290
I'm not breaking up with you.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.620
But...

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.870
She needs time

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.900
to get over it.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.530
By the way,

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:15.630
how did things go

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.610
on your end?

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.260
I've got a handle on it now.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:22.800
I know what I need to do

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.780
going forward.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.580
Don't worry.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.140
Relax.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.750
Being with you

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.390
fills my days

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.140
emotionally.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.020
The good, the bad,

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.780
the happy, and the painful,

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.190
I'm content

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.260
if we're in it together.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.460
Hey!

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:02.780
You know,

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.260
you're always so charming

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.260
when you talk like that.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.580
The soup's still simmering.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.820
Running into walls every single day.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.310
Why is it so hard

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.460
to find a new partner?

00:05:49.555 --> 00:05:50.511
It isn't harder

00:05:50.511 --> 00:05:52.000
than when we first started the business.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:53.410
Right.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.050
But the mindset's different now.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.140
I've got something
to my name these days.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.220
They call me Mr. Cheng now.

00:06:02.266 --> 00:06:04.533
Yet I still have to read
people's moods everywhere I go.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.370
I don't like that.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.410
It's fine.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.950
Keep looking.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.555
We'll find the right fit eventually.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.800
We've talked to seven or eight already

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.900
and still nothing.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.580
How are you still so calm?

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.190
Well,

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.480
this is as bad as it gets.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.660
How much worse can it be?

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.600
Besides, Mr. Li's already

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.977
moving forward with the lawsuit.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.390
If Kejun agrees

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.680
to settle,

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.170
it should ease things a lot.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.050
You've been enlightened.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.630
Someone wise

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.040
must be guiding you.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.680
Your mindset's

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.177
on a whole different level from mine.

00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:45.020
(What time do you get off work tonight?)

00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:46.140
(I'll come pick you up.)

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.900
I see,
you owe it to Ms. Cen Jin's guidance.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.720
Basic manners include staying out

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.340
of other people's private business.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.630
Say,

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:57.730
do people

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.610
turn into chatterboxes

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.170
once they're in love?

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.830
Say,

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:05.700
do people

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.240
turn nosy

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.730
once they get married?

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.530
How can Tao Wanwen put up with you?

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.900
Our relationship is going strong.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.970
Hey, Yiyang.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.100
Li Wu,

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.580
is now a good time to talk?

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:22.560
Yes.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.100
Go ahead.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.700
I just got some news.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.430
The Yi City
Environmental Protection Bureau

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.390
is planning

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.050
a targeted environmental
support project.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.870
They're opening it up for bids

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:31.970
from the public sector.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.360
I thought

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.780
it was a great opportunity,

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.870
so I recommended the CloudMap system

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.140
you developed to the institute.

00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:40.466
They think it's innovative
and has real potential.

00:07:40.488 --> 00:07:42.040
They'd like to invite you to collaborate

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.444
and participate in the bid together.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:44.700
Really?

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.480
We'll give it everything we've got.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.020
All right.

00:07:47.022 --> 00:07:49.220
I'll organize the materials
and send them over later.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.160
Come by the institute tomorrow
for a meeting.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.400
We'll talk it through together.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:53.460
No problem.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.930
A city-level project.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.930
If it pulls through,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.460
we'll have that government stamp
of approval going forward.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.370
That opens

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.460
things up instantly.

00:08:06.555 --> 00:08:08.155
No more running into walls everywhere

00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:08.830
like we are now.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.820
Settle down.

00:08:09.844 --> 00:08:11.920
Let's head back to the office
and have a meeting first.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.290
Okay.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.490
I'll notify the group chat.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.410
Wu, Rui, someone's here to see you.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.530
Who?

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.270
She said her surname's Tao.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.820
She's waiting in the meeting room.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.010
Ho...

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:37.540
Hello.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:38.650
Good to see you.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.220
Mr. Cheng. Mr. Li.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:43.390
Sorry

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.910
for dropping by without notice.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.480
We were doing an interview nearby.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.750
Once we wrapped up, we swung by.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.133
I wanted to get yours done quickly

00:08:49.133 --> 00:08:51.080
so I can try to make
the end-of-month release

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.890
and push it across all platforms.

00:08:54.511 --> 00:08:56.480
I've already sent you
the interview outline.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.044
If there's anything
you'd like to adjust,

00:08:58.066 --> 00:08:59.149
just let me know.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:08:59.890
Not at all.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.460
It's perfect.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:03.630
All right.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.440
Let's do the interview here.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.700
The lighting's good.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:07.650
Sure.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.610
You handle this.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:10.990
You know this side of the business.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.820
No.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.580
You should interview Mr. Li.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:16.711
I need to avoid
any conflict of interest.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:20.670
Okay.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:21.100
Come on.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:21.970
Have a seat.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:23.910
Here's fine, right?

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:24.420
Yes.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.240
We'll structure

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.890
the interview around five parts.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:30.910
The first

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.320
is an overview of the company.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.060
There are two questions
for that section.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.960
Thank you.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.060
That's plenty.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.340
Thanks so much.

00:09:53.088 --> 00:09:54.133
Appreciate the hard work.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.490
Mr. Cheng,

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.300
aren't you being a bit

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.180
too attentive to Ms. Tao?

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.060
All that food and drinks.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.240
She'll be eating it

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.610
for two weeks.

00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:06.180
When it's a beautiful woman,

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.540
of course, I'm attentive.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:09.960
Could you introduce

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.870
how your services

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:12.240
and products use AI

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.711
to drive environmental protection,

00:10:13.711 --> 00:10:15.460
with some concrete examples?

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.420
This is so annoying!

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.100
If it hadn't rained today,

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.550
we'd already be

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.130
up in the mountains stargazing.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.130
Stop sulking.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.060
When the weather
clears up in a few days,

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.540
I'll make it up to you.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.420
Your mom's coming over again tomorrow.

00:10:39.555 --> 00:10:40.977
Make sure you spend time with her.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.700
But when she's here,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.100
I won't see you for days.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:48.770
I'll miss you.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.120
We're lucky

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.300
she had other plans tonight.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.490
So we still get one night alone.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.610
She's driving me crazy!

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.840
I made up all kinds of excuses

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.650
to skip my cousin's wedding.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.700
She decided

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:06.100
to livestream the whole thing.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:12.220
(Mom)

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:13.540
It's endless.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.100
I'll mute her.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:24.820
So annoying.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:36.060
Chang.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.460
How about

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.340
we go camping right now?

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:47.490
Where?

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:15.890
What do you think?

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:17.420
Happy now?

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.010
Happier now.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:21.970
I like it.

00:12:22.177 --> 00:12:22.940
You earn a reward.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:24.970
That's it?

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:27.650
Not enough?

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.610
Still not enough?

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:52.610
Chang?

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:56.490
Mom?

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.580
Hello, Mrs. Chun.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.100
Mom,

00:13:07.888 --> 00:13:09.600
what made you come back
so late at night?

00:13:10.511 --> 00:13:11.150
Didn't you say

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:12.890
you were staying at my uncle's tonight?

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:14.550
There were

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.130
too many people at your uncle's place.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:18.010
I don't like staying in hotels.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.850
So I had them drive me back.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.180
I texted you but you didn't reply.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.777
I called and you didn't pick up either.

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.250
How many messages did you send?

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.440
Mrs. Chun, the water's just boiled.
Careful, it's hot.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:29.940
Okay.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:32.850
Join us.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:34.340
Sit.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.370
I didn't get your name.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.370
My name's Shen Yiyang.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:42.850
Just call me Shen.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:43.700
Okay.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.460
When Chun Chang told me

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.970
she had a boyfriend,

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.890
I thought she was brushing me off.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:52.850
Shen,

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.540
what do you do for work?

00:13:54.733 --> 00:13:55.940
Where does your family live?

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.340
Mom!

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.180
You just met him

00:13:59.266 --> 00:14:00.955
and you're already interrogating him.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.240
I'm just asking.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:02.820
It's fine.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:03.770
Mrs. Chun,

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.030
I work at the Environmental Protection
Research Institute.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:06.850
I'm local.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.730
My family runs a small business.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:10.540
Chun Chang and I

00:14:10.622 --> 00:14:12.311
only started seeing each other recently.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.790
We haven't found the right chance

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:14.650
to visit you yet.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.850
My daughter has a bit of a temper.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.850
Please be patient with her.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:23.300
Not at all.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.340
She's a real fireball, always lively.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:26.890
I'm quieter,

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.400
so we balance each other out.

00:14:30.622 --> 00:14:31.333
That reminds me.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:31.840
What do

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.420
your parents do?

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.130
Mom.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.370
Aren't you heading back?

00:14:38.511 --> 00:14:39.580
The rain's just stopped.

00:14:39.644 --> 00:14:40.711
You should go now.

00:14:41.111 --> 00:14:42.680
It'll be inconvenient if it rains again.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:43.890
Come on.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:48.220
Mrs. Chun, I'll head off then.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.220
Okay.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.720
Take care on the way.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.250
Okay.

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:52.420
And...

00:14:52.844 --> 00:14:54.890
If there's anything,
please let Chun Chang contact me.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.390
Okay.

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:55.890
All right.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.080
Goodbye, Mrs. Chun.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:57.650
Goodbye.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:14:59.060
Bye.

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:10.150
(Glazed Illusions)
It's a well-established

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:11.770
luxury jewelry brand.

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.720
They've always targeted

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.300
the old money crowd.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:16.700
But this year,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.540
they're launching a secondary line.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:22.030
They want to break out
of their usual circle

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:23.940
and attract a younger audience.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:25.240
They're also hoping

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.080
for a refresh in both concept

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.770
and creative direction.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.720
Do you have any ideas

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.060
or suggestions?

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.100
Ms. Shen.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.240
The brand

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.720
has strong public recognition,

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.480
but only

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.670
a small group can actually

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:39.730
afford it.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.940
Breaking into a wider consumer base

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.820
won't be easy.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.580
And sub-brands
from major labels are tricky.

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.320
They risk being neither premium

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.420
nor accessible.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:52.650
I was thinking,

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.460
if we join the bid,

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.120
the time and energy required

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:57.510
would be

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:58.580
significant.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.688
The cost-performance
might not be worth it.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:02.420
Ms. Cen,

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:03.850
what do you think?

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.300
I'd like to give it a shot.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.730
Let's hear it.

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.940
Innovating a heritage brand like this

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.490
is definitely challenging.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:16.670
But it also gives us

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:18.460
plenty of room to explore.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:20.970
We could try a lot of different things.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:22.670
Who knows?

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:24.480
We might accidentally create

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.220
a breakout hit.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.850
Why are you so keen?

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.370
I am genuinely interested.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:33.670
How should I put it?

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:35.030
Being able

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.060
to deal

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.270
with sparkly jewelry

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.130
is always enticing.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.790
All right, then.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:43.240
We'll hand this project over

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.420
to the Creative Department.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:47.030
Based on

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.250
my two rounds of discussions
with the client,

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:51.150
they're considering our team

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:53.220
because we're all quite young.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:55.540
In terms of content creativity,

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.510
as long as we stand out,

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:58.850
I think we'll already have

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:00.250
a strong edge.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.770
I'll be counting on all of you.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:04.540
Okay.

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:20.440
Looks like I'll need

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.610
to update this app again.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.370
What do you need to update?

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.060
You'll find out later.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:30.500
Fine, keep your secrets.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.260
Thank you.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.500
(Yi City
Environmental Protection Bureau)

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:54.030
The proposal went in today.

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:54.830
They should announce

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.130
the shortlist in three days.

00:18:58.030 --> 00:18:59.650
I asked around.

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:00.960
The other companies

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.070
just don't measure up

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:03.210
in credentials or capability.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:05.370
Our chances look good.

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:07.170
Really?

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.740
Yi has officially filed the case, too.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.110
Once that's settled,

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:12.200
this hurdle for the company

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.500
will be behind us.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:15.580
Celebration tonight?

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.580
No.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:17.680
I can't.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.610
I've got plans tonight.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.100
What about you, Uncle?

00:19:22.333 --> 00:19:23.480
You should be free, right?

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.270
Not me either.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:25.450
I've got plans as well.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:29.740
You two...

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.930
Who doesn't have plans?

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.980
I'm married, you know.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.410
Hey, Honey.

00:19:40.088 --> 00:19:40.890
What are you up to?

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:42.930
Let's go on a date.

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:45.450
We can order our rings
while we're at it.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.830
I'll try.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:49.640
But I probably

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.300
won't be done till 10 PM tonight.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.500
That... that's okay.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.650
I'll wait.

00:19:55.733 --> 00:19:56.888
No matter how late it gets.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.580

00:20:07.111 --> 00:20:08.222
I need to talk to you.

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:10.480
I think

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.200
the overall direction works.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.822
But the content strategy might still be

00:20:13.844 --> 00:20:15.500
a bit too conventional.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.400
I can already imagine

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.400
what the client will say.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.110
Either no wow factors

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:21.000
or nothing memorable

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:21.830

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.000
that they value

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.890
our youth and energy.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.850
So I think we can afford

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:32.240
to be bolder,

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.266

00:20:33.266 --> 00:20:34.550

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:35.890
of their existing circles?

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:36.510
All right.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:37.880
We'll brainstorm again

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.690
along those lines.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:39.750

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.410
You've got a train to catch.

00:28:07.444 --> 00:28:08.711
We don't want to be late.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.170
Don't be mad anymore.

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:33.540
I'm not mad anymore.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:34.980
Hurry and eat.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:43.640
Every time I see my mom,

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.060
we end up fighting.

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:46.820
After we fight, I feel guilty.

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.160
Then the next time we meet,

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.100
it's the same thing all over again.

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:52.650
It's exhausting.

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:55.690
My mom's the same.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.780
We have very different perspectives.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.550
If you try to reason with her,

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:01.044
you're just asking to be annoyed.

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:03.210
I think you should just ignore
whatever she says.

00:29:03.311 --> 00:29:04.510
If you don't want to hear it,

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:05.850
shut it out.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.000
That doesn't work at all.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.060
She's already met Shen Yiyang.

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:13.410
There's no getting past this now.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.020
I suppose your mother

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.170
approves of Mr. Shen.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:21.100
I don't need her approval.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.850
I just want her to stay out of it.

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:31.450
Come on.

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:44.130
Yes.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.130
About like that.

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.830
Let's run

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:55.060
the tests tonight.

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:56.260
Got it, Wu.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.377
Actually, forget it.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.500
Get some rest

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:12.740
early tonight.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:13.920
No rush.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.177
We'll handle it at work tomorrow.

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.850
You've worked hard lately.

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:18.580
Thanks, Wu.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.340
Li Wu!

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:25.850
We made it!

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:27.210
We made it!

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.260
Made what?

00:30:28.555 --> 00:30:30.266
Made it past
the first round of screening.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.930
The list's out.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.550
We're ranked first!

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:34.866
- We're number one!
- No. 1!

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:43.960
Great work, everyone.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.260
Dinner's on us tonight.

00:30:45.266 --> 00:30:46.160
- Hot pot!
- Hot pot!

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.440
I want hot pot!

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.310
Hot pot!

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:49.300
Order whatever you want.

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:50.450
Thanks, Mr. Cheng.

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:57.070
Xue,

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:58.130
want some tripe?

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:03.980
How's the new system going?

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:08.680
Honey!

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.170
What good news is it this time?

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.911
Our proposal for
Environmental Protection Bureau project

00:31:13.955 --> 00:31:15.177
passed the initial screening.

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:17.740
What do you mean

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.160
this time?

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.800
I've got some good news for you.

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.480
After your interview piece

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.640
was published,

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.400
an investment firm

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.266
I know well asked me
to make an introduction.

00:31:26.266 --> 00:31:27.580
They're very interested in you.

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:29.580
Which firm?

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.500
Xinshang Venture Capital.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.450
That's a top-tier investment firm.

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:36.930
We're interested too.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:38.110
All right.

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:38.960
I'll set up a meeting

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.930
for you to talk.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:40.820
Okay.

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:46.540
When luck turns, everything's different.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.820
It's like stepping in dog poo

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:49.930
and then

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:54.170
finding a bill hidden in it.

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:55.160
Okay.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.370
That's gross.

00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:58.740
It's just a metaphor.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:01.100
Oh, right.

00:32:01.666 --> 00:32:03.410
The day after tomorrow,
you'll be presenting

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.240
the proposal at the bureau.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.020
Me?

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.260
Of course.

00:32:08.266 --> 00:32:09.830
You know the technical side best.

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:10.890
If not you, then who?

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:12.930
But I...

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:15.610
Relax.

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:17.920
This system is your brainchild.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.150
You know it better than anyone.

00:32:19.155 --> 00:32:20.200
Just tell them

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.210
all your ideas honestly.

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:22.370
I guarantee

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:23.740
it'll be fine.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.020
Wait.

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:30.850
There is one big issue.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.930
First impressions matter.

00:32:40.222 --> 00:32:41.740
You can't lose any points on that.

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:20.410
What's the difference between these two?

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:21.920
The color.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:22.790
Can't you tell?

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:24.310
This one's a bit darker,

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:25.800
and this one has a subtle pattern.

00:33:25.911 --> 00:33:27.270
The color is also more slimming.

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:28.850
Where's the pattern?

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.300
Here, see?

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:36.820
Go try it on.

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:37.980
Here.

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:40.440
Thank you.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.470
Where's the fitting room?

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:42.270
This way. Follow me.

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:42.690
Okay.

00:33:42.777 --> 00:33:43.610
I'll be right back.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.622
- Here.
- Thank you.

00:33:57.555 --> 00:33:58.610
The mirror's over here.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.110
It suits you so well.

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.750
It's like

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:06.930
it was tailored just for you.

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.920
Your girlfriend

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:08.690
has great taste.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:11.580
I think so too.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.020
How is it?

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.130
Looks good.

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:20.100
Credit to me.

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.510
Excuse me.

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:24.920
Could you help me get

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.550
the black tie on the far left?

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:27.000
Of course.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:27.380
Thanks.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.150
It's quite distinctive, isn't it?

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:32.250
The sleeves are a bit long.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:33.730
We'll alter them.

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:39.800
Thank you.

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:40.420
You're welcome.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:06.730
He's so handsome!

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:09.060
What a body!

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:16.810
I told you to dress more formally.

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:18.980
Not to attract half the room.

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:22.670
Look at those ladies over there.

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:24.250
Their eyes are glued to you.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:27.690
Cen Jin picked it for me.

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:31.730
No wonder.

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:33.630
It's much more stylish

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:34.800
than what you usually wear.

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:37.580
Where's Yiyang?

00:35:38.666 --> 00:35:39.733
He needs results

00:35:39.733 --> 00:35:40.755
from an experiment today.

00:35:40.755 --> 00:35:41.529
He can't get away.

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:43.390
He said he's leaving everything
to you and me.

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.810
Of course.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.250
Mostly you.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:03.730
Nervous?

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.460
Same thing I always say.

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:08.900
We're friends.

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:10.440
Whatever happens,

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:11.444
we handle it together.

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.980
If the sky falls,

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.210
I'll hold it up
even if I have to tiptoe.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.030
Hello, everyone.

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.580
Here he comes.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.800
I see all the shortlisted units

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:22.690
have checked in.

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:24.940
Let's get started.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:26.580
First bidder,

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.210
Tongchen Technology.

00:36:54.707 --> 00:36:59.747
(All photos)

00:37:13.355 --> 00:37:14.420
Right after we wrapped up,

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.150
Director Li came over

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:17.580
and asked about our company.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.000
When we were founded,

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:19.670
and what projects

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:20.860
we've done over the years.

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.100
We could tell

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.380
he was genuinely interested in us.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:25.400
All right.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.810
Don't jump to conclusions yet.

00:37:26.822 --> 00:37:28.288
Let's wait until the results are out.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:29.580
You're right.

00:37:31.244 --> 00:37:32.100
Keep a low profile.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.020
Low profile.

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.650
Right.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:36.380
I need to tell my wife.

00:37:36.422 --> 00:37:37.866
She's been waiting for the news.

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:40.020
I should report in too.

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:43.210
Remember to tell Yiyang.

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:44.420
Got it.

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:48.710
When are you ever going

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:50.155
to stop taking advantage of me?

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:53.690
Hey, Honey.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:02.250
(All went smoothly.)

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:09.290
(Congratulations!)

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:13.650
(Do I get a reward?)

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:26.760
(Already sent it over.)

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:27.730
(Find it yourself.)

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:55.250
Wu.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.580
Congratulations!

00:38:56.688 --> 00:38:57.960
- Congratulations, Wu!
- Congrats.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.060
Congratulations, Wu!

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:00.150
Wu.

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:01.630
So, when are you treating us

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:02.670
to a meal?

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:03.420
That's right, Wu.

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:05.280
Congratulations on what?

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:07.710
I just got back. The second round results
aren't even out yet.

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:08.540
But Wu...

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:09.440
It's nothing.

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.280
Back to work, guys.

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.020
Get back to work.

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:12.460
Sit down, everyone.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:43.540
Li Wu!

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:47.900
Did you see it?

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.500
See what?

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.380
What are you guys even talking about?

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.420
Your Moments.

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:54.460
Hurry and open it!

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:56.500

Yes!

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:27.810
When did she post it?

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:29.210
Just now.

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:31.770
Why didn't you tell me?

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:33.770
Why do you think I'm here?

00:40:37.491 --> 00:40:47.500

Why did you suddenly make it public?

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.210
Did you block your parents?

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:30.690
No.
