[Episode 15]

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.120
I can't guarantee

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.770
that I'll be able to borrow it,

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.100
but I'll definitely give it my all anyway.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.400
As for Banco Nacional Ultramarino,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.259
I'll find a way out.

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.039
We're short of time,

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.500
so I won't go into details.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.080
But right now, my biggest concern is
neither of these.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.390
After this morning's incident,

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.870
the Japanese must now suspect

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.229
that the HSBC treasurer

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.050
disclosed the secret

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.509
of the forcibly issued HKD
before his death.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.920
The entire rubber business is a scam.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.480
Unless the Japanese have their doubts
completely erased,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.220
whatever trap we set this afternoon,

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.310
they're unlikely to fall for it easily.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.639
So this is the key issue.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.070
How about

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.420
I give it a try?

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.000
Xian,

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.800
what's your plan?

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.540
If we want the Japanese to believe
that the treasurer didn't leak anything,

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.100
we must take the initiative
to give them an answer.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.720
And only one person is suited

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.950
to give them this answer.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.010
Who is it?

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.990
A person who should be kept far away
from this conflict

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.140
and kept safe

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.780
from any harm.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.520

What brings you here?

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.930
I'm here

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.530

What's wrong?

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.590
Why did you suddenly call me out?

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:32.329
Have a seat.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.590
I called you here

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.640
because I wanted to tell you

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.120
that I've seen your brother.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.480
You've seen my brother?

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.620
When and where?

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:00.370

You mean

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.770
you want to borrow

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.970
all the funds of my Tai Ho Brotherhood?

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:17.769
Master Sanhe.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:19.399
In the past,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.120
I, Ma Wanqi, would have given you my word

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.240
that your money

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.700
would be returned in full.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.720
But this time,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.920
I cannot make any guarantees.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.120
Because once the plan fails,

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.190
the 4 major banks of Chinese merchants
will face total ruin,

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.460
with both Tai Fung Bank and Hengfengyu

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.140
declaring bankruptcy on the spot.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.590
I'm not telling this story for idle chat,

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:45.750
but because this story

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.280
is directly related to you.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.070
Because you not only know

the protagonist of this story,

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.900
but all the hardships he has endured

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.560
stemmed from the faith

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.930
he kept with you.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.020
You mean

for the Japanese in Hong Kong,

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.010
but now he has specifically come to Macau

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.870
to continue covering up for them?

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:08.890
This batch of forcibly issued HKD

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.620
has a huge impact on the market.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.800
That's why the Japanese

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.720
are using your brother's identity

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.480
to deceive Macau's merchants and banks,

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.600
so that they can maintain

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.620
their control over HKD
in today's exchange.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.430
But both Macau's financial industry

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.070
and its citizens

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.310
are consequently

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.450
suffering tremendous losses.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.240
Then why didn't you expose him directly?

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.570
Didn't the treasurer

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.940
tell you the truth before he died?

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.370
Why didn't you

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.010
tell the citizens of Macau directly?

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.510
We're bankers.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.240
If we were to expose this,

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.020
few people would believe us.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.450
Our credibility is
nowhere near the level of trust

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.450
placed in your brother,
the Chief Accountant of HSBC.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.290
That is to say,

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.520
because of my brother's lies,

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.190
many citizens of Macau

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.140
are now being deceived by the Japanese

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.610
and are losing their life savings

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.840
while being kept completely in the dark.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.640
Is that right?

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.130
Yes.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.140
What exactly did the treasurer tell you
before he died?

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.290
How much is this batch of
Hong Kong dollars in total?

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.490
And what do the Japanese plan to do next?

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.470
Do you really want to know?

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.300
Someone must expose

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.760
my brother's lies.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.110
Someone must make amends for his mistakes.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.920
Even though I can't compensate
for everything,

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.050
at least I can reduce some of the losses.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.380
Every little bit helps.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.000
Okay.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.030
I'll tell you everything.

What are you doing?

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.090
Since Banco Nacional Ultramarino
can't honor its commitment,

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.730
then I, Rodrigues, will honor it.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.590
How much Hong Kong dollars
does the bank have left?

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.290
Withdraw all sell orders.
I'll buy them all.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.010
There are sell orders for 7 million HKD.

Banco Nacional Ultramarino

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.940
just added sell orders for 7 million HKD.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.270
Combined with this morning's sell orders,

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.730

The so-called newly issued
Hong Kong dollars by HSBC

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:05.630
were actually stolen by the Japanese

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.070
from HSBC's vault.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.550
There are no reserve funds at all.

They're equivalent to
a pile of waste paper.

is only 10 million.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.790
That is an out-and-out lie.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.320
The actual amount issued far exceeds
what was reported in the news.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.240
Moreover, the Japanese will choose a date

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.790
to invalidate all these Hong Kong dollars.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.940
-They're all exposed. Oh, no.
-If you have Hong Kong dollars,
sell them off.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:26.980
Now everything is ruined.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.030
Is it true?

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.680
Who on earth is this person?

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:30.800
I don't know.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.860
Isn't it Miss Qiao Yinwan?

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.860
You know her?

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.320
She's the sister of Qiao Renyu,

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.370
the Chief Accountant of HSBC.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:37.910
Qiao Yinwan, a violinist.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:39.390
Besides, these Hong Kong dollars

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.740
were issued by her brother.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.510
What she says must be true.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.410
Hurry and sell off
all your Hong Kong dollars, everyone.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.260
Yes, hurry and sell off
your Hong Kong dollars.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.520
Come and sell off your Hong Kong dollars.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.710
Inform the traders.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.110
Sell them off!
Sell all the Hong Kong dollars off!

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.510
Yes.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.960
What did you say?

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.160
What's wrong?

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.310
The trader reported

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:06.080
that Banco Nacional Ultramarino

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.050
just withdrew all their sell orders

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:09.820
and started buying instead.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.000
What?

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.870
Miss Qiao, I'm the Chairman
of Tai Fung Bank.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.700
You just said the amount
of Hong Kong dollars issued is incorrect.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:17.750
Then what is

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:18.890
the exact amount?

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.540
It's exactly 40 million.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:21.750
Forty million?

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:22.740
That much?

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:23.530
You also said

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:25.140
that the Japanese want to invalidate HKD.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.250
Then what will they use to replace it?

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.010
After the Japanese

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:29.740
sell all these Hong Kong dollars,

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.130
they'll force HSBC

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:32.100
to issue new Hong Kong dollars.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.580
By then, all the old Hong Kong dollars

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.240
can only be exchanged at a discount
for new ones.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.070
Hurry and sell off your Hong Kong dollars!

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.660
What nonsense is she talking about?

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.870
General Manager.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.030
This woman claimed
to be revealing the truth,

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.870
but what she said about the amount
of Hong Kong dollars issued

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.140
and the follow-up measures
is completely wrong.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.400
What she said

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.860
couldn't possibly come from
the HSBC treasurer.

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:00.860
It was totally fabricated.

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.090
Report!

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:05.560
What is it?

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.420
Our informant at Tai Fung Bank reported

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.370
that Huang Sanhe just escorted
Tai Ho Brotherhood's

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:12.370
cash reserves

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:13.960
into Tai Fung Bank.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.370
Tai Ho Brotherhood?

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.480
It's the largest smuggling gang
in the area.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.810
It's very powerful

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.760
and is also in cahoots
with those Chinese merchants.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:24.030
How do you know

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.100
he was escorting
Tai Ho Brotherhood's cash reserves?

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.780
All the boxes have the characters
"Ho Yee" on them.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.450
Those are the cash boxes
for the gang's savings.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.950
Huang Sanhe brought
20 to 30 boxes this time.

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:35.980
It seems that he's betting
everything he has.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.440
You mean
there are dozens of boxes of dollars?

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.480
Not just that.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.740
Huang Sanhe also brought many gold bars.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.470
Qiao Renyu's sister was spreading lies
in public.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.620
What is the exact amount
of Hong Kong dollars issued?

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.170
It's exactly 40 million.

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.320
Hurry and sell off all your
Hong Kong dollars.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.000
Yes, hurry and sell off
your Hong Kong dollars.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.080
Banco Nacional Ultramarino
withdrew sell orders and started buying.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.160
Tai Fung Bank also secretly transferred in
a large sum of money.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.470
What are they up to?

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:20.450
You.

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:22.640
Why are you smiling?

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:24.900
Someone

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.770
claims to be a financial genius

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.920
who never loses,

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:33.450
yet he was thrown into disarray
by a classic case of crisis profiteering.

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:35.110
I never expected this.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:37.630
Mr. Qiao,

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.550
what do you mean by 'crisis profiteering'?

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:41.940
What could I mean?

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.960
I'm just a spy, aren't I?

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.030
If I tell you,

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.710
you'll only think
I'm colluding with Chinese merchants.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:50.240
Why would I ask for trouble?

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:54.610
I

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.760
misunderstood you before.

00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:59.070
I sincerely apologize to you.

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:01.900
I hope you can speak candidly,
holding nothing back.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:02.620
If I tell you,

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:03.270
won't you think

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:04.750
I'm setting a trap for you?

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:05.630
Qiao Renyu!

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:07.680
Don't forget

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:10.410
you're still a prisoner
of the Imperial Army.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:15.860
Can't you still understand

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.330
the current situation?

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:19.810
With Specie Bank's backstop this morning,

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.790
the Chinese merchants
were completely overwhelmed.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.860
So he could only stir up trouble

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:26.960
to make you doubt yourselves.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.550
That's why Banco Nacional Ultramarino

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.600
suddenly sold off all their holdings?

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.920
With just one trick,

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:35.350
you've already stopped
defending the market.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.840
Then they

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.910
used the HSBC treasurer's death in Macau

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:42.030
to release a so-called secret
from the treasurer,

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:43.510
which threw the market into panic

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:44.790
and caused HKD to plunge.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:46.530
The only thing I didn't expect

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:48.720
was that they even used my sister.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:50.530
They're indeed resourceful.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:52.250
So

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.670
the HSBC treasurer

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.000
didn't disclose any secrets at all?

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.160
Your sister was simply bought
by the Chinese merchants,

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.040
using her special identity

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.200
to make up lies and create panic?

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:04.860
I know my sister.

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:06.740
She knows nothing about finance.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.860
As for how they found her

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:10.890
and what lies they used to trick her,

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:12.270
that remains unclear to me.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:14.670
But they've already achieved their goals.

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:15.830
HKD is plunging.

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:17.210
The market is in panic.

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:18.980
Specie Bank has stopped
defending the market.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:19.910
And they,

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:21.700
if I'm not mistaken,

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:23.540
must be taking this chance

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.430
to snap up
all the retail investors' dollars

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:26.980
at low prices.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:30.840
[HKD: 2.51]

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.520
[HKD: 2.41]

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.160
I want to buy 200,000 HKD.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.430
I want to buy 300,000 HKD.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.040
I want to buy 350,000 HKD.

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:37.560
Okay.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.860
There are people
buying Hong Kong dollars here too.

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:45.040
Hello?

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.130
The Chinese merchants' agents are buying?

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:54.970
This is Ogata speaking.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:56.000
Are you sure?

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.920
General Manager, I'm sure.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:15:59.260
The agents arranged by
the Chinese merchants

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:00.030
[Specie Bank]

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:01.530
are all taking advantage of the HKD plunge

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.590
to secretly buy them
priced at 2.4 dollars.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.500
Nice bit of crisis profiteering there.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.170
They really put on a convincing show.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:08.640
Ask all the traders

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.860
to defend the market immediately

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:10.970
and buy them all.

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.240
But the market is in panic now.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.000
And our remaining funds

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.800
may not hold up
under such heavy selling pressure.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.210
You just focus on defending the market.

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:25.880
I'll handle the panic.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:39.090
Mr. Qiao.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.320
Next,

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:44.540
we need you to help
calm the retail investors.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:46.250
What else can I do?

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.280
The panic outside

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:52.800
was all caused by your sister
who used her special relationship

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.080
with you.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.100
The trouble caused by the sister
of HSBC's Chief Accountant.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:01.440
There's nothing more effective
at scotching rumors

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.270
than a personal rebuttal

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.500
from the Chief Accountant himself.

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:13.880
Honored colleagues
from the banking industry

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.319
and citizens of Macau,

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:18.710
I'm Ogata Yozo,
the General Manager of Specie Bank.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:19.980
Just now,

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.910
we found that someone
with ulterior motives

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:25.480
was spreading rumors about HKD.

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:27.390
This is a deliberate act

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:29.820
to create panic among us

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.850
for profiteering.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.270
Such actions,

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.520
in my opinion, have seriously disrupted

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.010
the financial stability in Macau.

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:38.240
Yinwan, let's go.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.110
-Japanese Specie Bank...
-It's okay.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:41.640
I want to see what he's up to.

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:44.190
He's just continuing to lie.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.610
With us here, we won't let him succeed.

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:48.140
-Let's go.
-It's okay, Xian.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.130
I want to see.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:52.050
Only one person is qualified

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:54.490
to tell you the truth about HKD.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:58.140
Now, let's welcome Mr. Qiao Renyu,

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:01.930
the Chief Accountant of HSBC,
to publicly clarify the facts

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.180
and reveal the truth about this matter.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.650
Renyu.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.000
Yinwan.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.860
I'm Qiao Renyu,
the Chief Accountant of HSBC.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:15.680
The total amount
of the newly issued Hong Kong dollars

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.800
is indeed 10 million dollars,

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.020
and it is backed by
sufficient reserve funds.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.350
-There is absolutely no problem.
-Renyu!

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:24.680
Yinwan.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:30.830
Mr. Qiao.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.530
Furthermore,

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:40.820
the Japanese Imperial Army

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:44.260
hasn't interfered in any
normal operations of HSBC.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.750
The rumor that HKD is being invalidated

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:46.830
is absolute nonsense.

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:48.010
You're lying!

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:48.660
Stop right there!

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.660
What are you doing?

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:50.350
Hands off!

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:50.860
Freeze!

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.350
Renyu, I don't know
what threat you're under,

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:54.420
but no matter what,

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:56.330
you cannot be complicit in it

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:58.940
by doing such unconscionable things
for the Japanese.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:00.740
Please tell everyone the truth.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.740
I'm begging you, Renyu.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.420
Tell everyone the truth.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.220
Please, I'm begging you, Renyu.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:07.480
Tell everyone the truth.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.550
Mr. Qiao.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.960
Are you going to continue
allowing your sister

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.590
to spread rumors
and mislead the public here?

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:25.260
Renyu.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.020
Yinwan.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.950
I don't know what threat you're under

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:33.720
or what benefits you've received
from certain people,

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.010
but why are you here
slandering the Imperial Army

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.010
and smearing HSBC?

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:40.400
I can only tell everyone

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.470
that I'm the Chief Accountant of HSBC,

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:44.760
and only I

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:47.090
can speak on behalf of HSBC.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.660
Compared to your lies,

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.900
what I say will undoubtedly
be believed as the truth.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.810
You must trust the Japanese Imperial Army!

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:56.540
Trust HSBC!

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:16.740
Qiao Renyu.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.310
From today on,

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:22.740
I, Qiao Yinwan, will no longer have you
as my brother

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.350
who serves as a lackey for the Japanese.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:34.220
Qiao Renyu!

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.400
You traitor!

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.270
Qiao Renyu!

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:38.720
You traitor!

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:39.770
Qiao Renyu!

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:41.170
You traitor!

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.000
Mr. He,

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.250
I never expected you to use my sister

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.830
and then attack me.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.770
What other schemes
do you Chinese merchants have?

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:52.230
Bring them all out.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:53.010
I'm waiting.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:56.510
Let's go.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.460
What's going on?

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:17.610
Thank you.

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.400
Let Yinwan rest first.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:44.680
Don't disturb her.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:45.970
Later,

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:47.730
I'll explain it to her.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:50.320
Now,

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.720
pull yourselves together.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.650
We still have a tough battle ahead.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:06.770
[Mingde]

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:13.540
[HKD: 3.02]

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:15.880
Apart from the retail market
where there are no big sell orders,

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.520
those Chinese merchants' agents
have all stopped buying.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:19.510
General Manager,

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:21.310
should we increase our buy orders
and push the price up?

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:22.250
No.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.030
Hold steady for now.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:26.940
The Chinese merchants and BNU might still
make unexpected moves.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.350
Observe the situation for now.

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:28.790
Yes.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:39.400
Mr. Qiao.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.320
Your sister must have been misled
by someone.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.650
She got a little carried away
at that time.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.140
You don't need to worry too much about it.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.680
Once this battle is over,

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.350
you can give a more detailed explanation
to her.

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:52.700
By that time,

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:55.530
you and your sister will be reconciled.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:57.580
I've done everything I can,

00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:59.670
as you requested.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.140
Mr. Ogata,

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.530
you can drop the act.

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:08.990
Mr. Qiao, don't quit now.

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:11.440
Although we've defended the market
for now,

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.770
there are still 2 or 3 hours
until the close.

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:14.830
Those Chinese merchants

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:17.220
won't just sit there
and wait to be defeated.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.950
What moves might they have
up their sleeves next?

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:21.070
Mr. Qiao,

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:23.520
please foresee what they might do.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.980
I'm hungry.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:28.250
What?

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:31.140
I want an apple pie.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.350
Hello?

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:38.830
Mr. Rodrigues.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.600
HKD has climbed back to 3 dollars.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.600
While Specie Bank is fully engaged
in defending the market,

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.450
should we consider
selling some of our holdings

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.610
to relieve our future pressure?

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:50.260
No.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:52.010
We need to hold steady for now.

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:52.820
Don't sell them.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.160
Putting all our hopes on one final move

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:57.520
is far too risky.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:11.850
Mr. Qiao,

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:13.280
how is it?

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:29.020
Based on today's market data,

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:33.700
with the Chinese banks and
Banco Nacional ltramarino's transactions,

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:37.670
they should have about 40 million left.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.140
That matches

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.540
my calculation exactly.

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:43.090
If you were in their position,

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.860
would there still be a way
to turn the tables?

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:48.970
According to the current situation,

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:50.440
it's virtually

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:51.770
impossible.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.350
Virtually?

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.600
So there's still a slim chance?

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:57.940
There is no slim chance,

00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:58.810
unless...

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.270
Unless what?

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:04.030
Let me put it this way.

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:06.660
Specie Bank has the upper hand now.

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:07.740
Its only weakness is

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.710
that, after the previous upheavals,

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:11.870
its market-support funds
have been severely depleted.

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:14.070
Their remaining funds can't withstand

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.470
another market crash.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.200
That is to say,

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:20.220
they might capitalize
on our limited market-support funds

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:21.740
to launch a sudden attack?

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.680
Specie Bank's remaining funds

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.180
can only absorb

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.790
about less than 10 million
Hong Kong dollars.

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:29.750
If the opposition

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.890
suddenly sells off 7 or 8 million

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:34.200
—or even just 5 million—
Hong Kong dollars at once,

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.370
HKD will plunge immediately,

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.330
causing panic in the market again.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.190
Once you buy them back
to defend the market then,

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:42.790
all retail investors will be
panic selling.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.060
This market,

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:46.490
will you still be able to defend it then?

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:47.450
Oh, no.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.380
If that happens,

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:50.750
all our efforts will be for nothing,

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:53.950
resulting in total loss
and irreversible consequences.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.220
Mr. Qiao, based on your experience,

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:58.700
when are they most likely

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.190
to launch a sudden attack?

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.580
If it were me,

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:08.390
I would time it

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:10.740
for the last half an hour
before the close.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:11.700
If it were too early,

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.810
I'd worry your market-support funds
wouldn't be sufficient.

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:14.550
If it were too late,

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:17.170
I'd worry there wouldn't be enough time
to buy your holdings.

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:18.170
Half an hour

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:19.620
is just right.

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.270
That makes sense.

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:26.050
Now I know what to do.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.320
With Specie Bank's strength,

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:45.260
it still needs us to organize funds
to defend the market?

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.080
Not only Lyun Coeng

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:48.450
but also all other major
Japanese businesses in Macau

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:50.410
have received an urgent order

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.520
to mobilize immediately.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.730
I'm entrusting this matter to you.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.960
But I heard that HKD is
extremely volatile today.

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:03.600
If the market support fails,

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:28.640
on the rubber contract.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.040
Was it

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:36.300
also my brother who told you
the serial numbers

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:37.760
that were just broadcast?

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:42.340
Yes.

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:50.390
Then why didn't you tell me before?

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.930
To eliminate the harm of this batch of
forcibly issued HKD,

00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:58.990
we had to publish the serial numbers.

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:00.300
But this also meant

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.690
that your brother must be sacrificed.

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:06.800
For you,

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.410
that would be too cruel.

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:13.260
So...

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.100
So you made me

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.680
go on believing my brother was a traitor

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:20.040
and then used me

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.580
to spread false information.

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:23.450
Am I right?

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:28.200
You're his sister.

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:31.750
You were the most suitable person
to play this part.

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:34.030
But if there had been
even a hint of pretense

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:36.000
in the performance meant for the Japanese,

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.090
it would have been detected,

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:38.550
leading to total failure.

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:39.680
So

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:43.280
I had to continue keeping it from you.

00:37:59.080 --> 00:37:59.980
Yes.

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:05.540
You were afraid that I couldn't act
convincingly enough.

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:09.580
So you made me go on believing
my brother was a traitor

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.440
and publicly disown him,

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.170
severing our ties as siblings.

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.980
I even slapped my brother hard

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:19.030
across his face.

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:21.510
Is that right, He Xian?

00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:26.720
Yinwan.

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:29.250
I didn't expect that you two would meet.

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:31.180
But it was already too late by then.

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:45.920
Yinwan.

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:49.850
Your brother is a man of great wisdom.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.510
Even when faced
with such an unexpected situation,

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:53.910
he remained so resilient

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.990
and calm.

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:56.940
Not only did he not screw it up,

00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:58.230
he even managed to get

00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:59.690
the hint I dropped to him,

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:02.710
completing the final blow
to the Japanese.

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:04.280
Your brother

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:05.990
played a pivotal role

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:07.320
in this victory.

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:08.910
I don't want to hear this.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.830
I don't want to hear this.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.200
Tell me!

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.900
Tell me now!

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:21.520
Chief,

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:23.540
he won't survive another blow.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.720
Take him back to Hong Kong

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:29.730
and interrogate him!

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:34.850
Mr. Ogata.

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:36.930
Ogata!

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:40.060
I warned you repeatedly,

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:43.900
but you insisted on your own way.

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:46.690
In just one day, not only
were all our efforts for nothing,

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.550
but now all the serial numbers
have been exposed,

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:50.820
causing over 100 million
forcibly issued HKD

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:53.310
to lose its strategic value.

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.380
For the losses you've caused the Empire,

00:39:56.860 --> 00:40:00.260
you'll have to atone for it yourself.

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:03.720
General Manager!

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:05.470
General Manager!

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:07.020
General Manager!

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:18.570
Damn it!

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:22.130
Xian.

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.650
The rescue plan went wrong.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:36.670
[Pier 12]

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.040
After leaving Specie Bank,

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:54.610
no matter where they went,

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:57.010
they should have passed our ambush point.

00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:59.090
We didn't expect them
to turn early towards the pier.

00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:00.450
By the time we got here,

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:01.800
it was already too late.

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:41.500
Yinwan.

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:43.110
