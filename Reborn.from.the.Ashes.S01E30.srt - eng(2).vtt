[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.440
[Episode 30]

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.440
Husband and wife bow to each other.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.920
May we walk hand in hand
through this life,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.840
promising to grow old together.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.880
[One year later]

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.520
Madam,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.590
you truly have miraculous healing hands.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.550
These little daisies were clearly wilted
a few days ago.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.000
After you tended them,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.990
in just a few days, they started
to bloom again.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.920
It's getting late.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.140
I'm going back to rest now.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.070
Madam,

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.880
since His Highness passed away,

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.630
you've spent your days either sleeping
or tending to flowers.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.660
It's been like this every day
for a year.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.270
What a dull life you've led.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.100
Tomorrow is
the Colorful Clouds Festival.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.100
You should go out
and get some fresh air.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.520
We'll go.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.520
Yes.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.270
Is there anyone kind enough

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.840
to spare a copper coin?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.320
I haven't eaten for days.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.320
Give me some money, please.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.270
Sir.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.110
Miss.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:20.550
Please be kind.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.630
Thank you.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.270
He looks so familiar.

I won again.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.040
Alright, alright.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.750
Let's say you luckily won again.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.990
What do you mean by "luckily"?

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.630
You're the one who cheated first.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.110
I just made the game

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.360
more interesting.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.960
Cheating is cheating.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.550
You make it sound so noble.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.550
Shame on you.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.150
No cheating next time, understood?

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.110
That depends on my mood.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.750
I'm neither human, god, nor demon.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.030
I've walked this world
for thousands of years.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.550
I've met countless humans along the way.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.400
I realized humans are like trees,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.070
yearning for the light up above,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.150
while rooted in the darkness below.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.520
It must be more light than darkness,

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.840
more good than evil.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.360
Because human nature at birth

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.190
is inherently good.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.160
What if I said human nature
is inherently bad?

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.480
You little thing.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.320
Old thing,

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.190
then let's make a bet.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.800
18 beads in total,

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.480
gold beads represent good,
red beads represent evil.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.590
It's a deal.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.710
I've won.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:25.320
How about that?

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.750
I'm telling you, in this world,

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.800
good outweighs evil.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.880
You just happened to win
time after time.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:32.710
What's there to be proud of?

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.670
Humans are selfish by nature.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.320
Evil always outnumbers good.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.190
I've lived longer than you,

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.740
and seen more than you have.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.590
But facts speak louder than words.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.110
Now, out of 18 beads, nine are golden.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.630
Sooner or later,

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.110
I'll turn every single one
of your pearls

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.320
deep red.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.850
Still talking tough after losing?

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.710
Look.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.870
The two people at the bottom of the lake

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.400
actually harbor such great resentment
and will to survive.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.320
How about

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.920
we bet one more time?

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.960
Come on.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.270
Let's see how I make you admit defeat.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.880
The game begins.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.480
See that?

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.630
How deep is Wen Yueqian
and Xiao Jin's resentment,

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.890
and how strong is their belief
in revenge.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.230
This time,

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.670
I'm sure to win.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.880
Don't celebrate too soon.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.690
I believe their true nature
is pure and kind,

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.380
and they will never
lose their conscience.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.240
You don't understand.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.230
When a person encounters unfairness,

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.360
pain,

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.320
hardship,

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.800
and darkness,

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.880
resentment and grievance

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.480
will arise.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.000
Can't they repay evil with kindness?

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.040
Besides,

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.980
a gentleman is judged by actions,
not intentions.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.210
What one thinks doesn't matter.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.440
What one does matters.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.630
Just wait and see.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.960
This round...

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.070
You actually cheated.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.320
How could you let Su Feiyi go?

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.520
How can this be considered cheating?

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.190
I only made the game more interesting.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.800
As long as someone with pure Yang blood

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.000
pulls out the spear from his chest

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.520
and stabs it into my body.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.360
He will vanish into dust.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.190
You're heartless and unreasonable.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.000
You old fool!

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.710
You're cheating again.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.630
Show some humanity.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.670
I was never human to begin with.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.360
You're not human either, little one.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:19.520
Foolish!

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.630
It is

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.360
like drawing water with a sieve.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.060
You've been acting for so long,

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.330
yet you're still spouting nonsense
about refining

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.480
and supreme power.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.670
In the end, it's kindness that wins.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.230
Silence!

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.480
What a waste of effort.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.710
Look at you, after all that fuss,

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:40.980
it still ended up being nothing.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.750
You're celebrating too soon.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.800
The game isn't over yet.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.920
Shame on you!

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.630
You're cheating.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.520
Hey, what are we doing now?

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.360
Right now?

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.590
