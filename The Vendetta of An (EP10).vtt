[The Vendetta of An]

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.020
[Before Xie Huai'an enters Chang'an]

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.820
I have lost.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.100
Then please, Han,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.570
return the way you came

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.820
as we agreed.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.980
On this matter,

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.500
forgive me,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.130
but I must go back on my word.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.750
Do you know why His Majesty

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.500
has summoned you?

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.820
Yes,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.170
and that's exactly why

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.570
I must go.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.660
If you wish to save Xiao Wenjing,

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.500
you should not go.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.260
If you do not believe me,

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.940
let's wager once more.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.410
I will find someone

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.850
and disguise him as you

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.410
to meet the Emperor in your place.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.500
If he dies,

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.850
I win,

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:41.940
and you will

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.730
do one thing for me.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.010
But how will that man

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.100
know what I am supposed to say?

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.260
He won't need to say anything,

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.570
because the Emperor won't ask.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.540
The moment Han Ziling meets the Emperor

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.570
will already be the time of his death.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.100
How did you know

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.360
[Flatbread with Soup]

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.500
I would die after seeing

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.410
His Majesty?

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.010
Because I knew

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.780
what His Majesty intended to do,

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.060
and I knew

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.220
you were recommended by Gu Yu.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.380
General Gu has always been loyal.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.060
Did His Majesty suspect him of treachery?

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.540
His Majesty knew

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.690
Gu Yu was a good man.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.890
And for that very reason,

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.500
he knew anyone Gu Yu recommended

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.570
would never harm

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.940
the deposed emperor.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.820
Killing you

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.220
was to warn Gu Yu

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.750
not to interfere.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.540
Better

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.380
to settle it early

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.780
than fall out

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.610
with the Gu family afterward.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.060
Who was the man dying

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.340
in my place?

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.340
A wanted criminal.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.650
I promised to give his family

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.900
1,000 liang

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.740
of gold

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.900
if he agreed to do this.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.180
So it seems,

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.860
Xie,

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.860
you are not a good man.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.890
A good man can help neither you

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.620
nor the one you wish to save.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.810
What do you want me to do?

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.450
Infiltrate a place for me.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.420
Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.300
Dump it in the back.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.890
All right.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.500
[Episode 10]

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.860
I also prepared a gift for you.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.010
You'll like it.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.370
I am sorry, Di.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.810
I must rescue Gu Yu.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.890
He kept staring at me just now.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.980
He just realized

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.690
you and I were working together.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.010
He checked my travel passes and wounds,

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.370
but our planning

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.450
left him with no reason to suspect me.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.220
He truly took you as a friend.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.570
Yet I was your undercover agent.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.780
Because of an accident,

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.490
his death

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.100
became inevitable.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.540
Scheming...

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:05.980
Both you and I

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.220
know how to do it.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.420
But in the end,

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.420
it is still a blade going in white

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.620
and coming out red.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.180
But you did nothing wrong.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:20.980
If you had hesitated,

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.660
the ones buried underground

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.740
would be you and me.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.060
I know.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.930
Whether I liked him had little to do

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.180
with whether I should kill him.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.490
In the end,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.980
people only kill to save themselves.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:43.780
Di Lu

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.570
was well-liked in Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.540
His death won't stay hidden for long.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.490
We need to match our accounts.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.330
This house faces north

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.100
and is always damp.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.810
The smell of wine will linger for more than ten days.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.370
It can cover

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.810
the smell of the body for a while.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.810
Invited by Di Lu,

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.490
you and I went to try

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:19.490
his homemade pine needle wine.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.060
We entered his home in the first half of the Xu hour.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.010
We drank, chatted, and enjoyed each other's company.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.540
We even grew a bit carried away

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.250
and accidentally knocked over a few jars.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:29.450
We left before the Hai hour.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.300
After returning home,

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.900
you had a hangover headache

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:33.850
and stayed in bed,

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.450
while I was busy

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:36.300
writing travel passes.

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:37.930
When we saw each other again,

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:39.930
it was already two or three days later.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.420
And from that day on,

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.850
neither of us ever saw Di Lu again.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:34.300
Who is it?

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:34.900
Me,

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:35.850
Li Sangeng.

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.730
What is it?

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.210
Mr. Li Mingtai

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:40.450
needs a travel pass,

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.500
but he is ill and bedridden,

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.780
so he sent me on his behalf.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.780
Please prepare a travel pass for him.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.450
It's a hot day.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:02.730
Come in for some tea.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:04.850
Everyone,

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.780
take a break.

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:08.030
- All right. - All right.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.450
All right.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.060
Li Mingtai is bedridden?

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:23.930
Was that your doing?

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.480
I needed

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.610
a proper excuse to visit you,

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.090
so I treated him to some questionable buns.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:33.850
These past few days, I walked every lane.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.420
So far, I've heard no talk of Di Lu.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.500
He had gone out on assignment before.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.690
A short absence

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.380
may not raise suspicion.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:46.810
But give it a few more days, and it won't hold.

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:49.500
Tell me,

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.850
what have you learned?

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.380
Before I came,

00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:59.730
you told me

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.850
Hidden Soldier Alley was a concept,

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.780
not just a single alley.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.020
So after I entered the alley,

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:06.970
the first thing I did

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.080
was confirm

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.540
its full layout.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.300
Here in Yanzuo Ward,

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.090
from south to north is 450 bu,

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.380
and from west to east is 650 bu.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:19.900
Within this entire area,

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:22.060
everything except the outermost ring

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.450
is Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.300
The outermost ring

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.300
is where common people live,

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:31.210
meaning

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.140
it offers the best cover.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.020
And in danger,

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.140
the best hostages.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.850
Now look at the row houses on the west side.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.260
They look densely packed,

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.660
but they produce very little trash each day.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:47.660
That means the fewest soldiers are hidden there,

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.300
and the defense is thinnest.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:51.660
So where are the troops kept?

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:52.930
The northwest

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:54.260
and the southeast.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:55.210
Both areas

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:56.570
have many soldiers.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.780
Avoid them when you move.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:12:59.970
Even on ordinary days,

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.210
go around them if you can.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.260
Any leads

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.690
on Gu Yu?

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:05.660
None needed.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.780
Almost everyone knows where he is.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:09.780
Capturing Gu Yu

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.730
is quite a feat for Wang Pu.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.090
That night, I saw it with my own eyes.

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:15.900
Wang Pu, with two Huben guards,

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.140
dragged Gu Yu

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.420
[Market]
through the streets and alleys

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:21.330
[Zuihua Tower]
into the Zuihua Tower by the market.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:37.540
What is it?

you and I

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:34.980
he'd had

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.810
a misunderstanding with the new guy

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:39.890
and wanted to give him these as an apology.

Then he vanished.

if you hadn't dyed your hair white,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.700
I wouldn't have recognized you.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.940
Since you know who I am,

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.130
you should know

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.810
I am here for revenge.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.460
Not one who deserves death

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:34.980
will escape.

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:40.130
Aren't you afraid you'll fall into my hands?

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.370
I won't spare you either!

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.260
Of course I'm not afraid.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.410
There's someone locked up

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:53.810
in the Imperial Guard prison.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.300
I wonder how he is now.

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:00.780
Before I came here,

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:02.980
I took

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:05.260
a gold coin from him.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.500
To the Huben Army,

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:24.740
Qingyi

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:26.740
is nothing more than an expendable pawn.

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.740
And expendable pawns

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.980
should be tossed away,

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:33.460
just like Liu Ziyan.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.850
But to me,

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.570
he is still useful.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.570
If nothing happens to me, nothing happens to him.

If something happens to me,

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.850
he won't even have a body left to bury.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:49.850
His fate

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.780
is in your hands.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:55.540
Yes, he's my disciple.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:57.460
So what?

00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:59.500
The rules of the Huben Army

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.260
come above all else!

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:08.220
You are right about that.

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:10.490
But if you truly believed that,

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.460
you would have reported me

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.410
to Wang Pu

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.850
the moment you sensed something was wrong,

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.890
instead of sitting here waiting for me,

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:22.090
afraid I might have a plan.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.700
Rules

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:24.570

People are flexible.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.410
I know the bond between you and Qingyi

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:30.130
goes beyond master and disciple.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.170
Many years ago,

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.780
your only child died young.

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:36.460
A few years later,

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:38.170
you found Qingyi

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.650
eating offerings at your child's grave,

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:43.700
and you took him in as a gift sent from above.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:45.570
You don't want

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.770
your second child

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:50.780
to die like this, do you?

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.370
All you need to do is keep silent

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.740
and let me stay hidden in Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:01.460
Once I leave,

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.890
your second child

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.700
will return to you unharmed.

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:10.870
He schemed against you,

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:15.370
and he has done his share of deeds for the Huben Army.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:16.650
Will you really spare him?

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.540
I will leave no enemy alive.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.460
But I still have

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:29.090
some humanity left.

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:38.460
Aunt Xin.

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:49.850
You were one of my father's

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.330
earliest subordinates.

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:54.650
I still

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:57.130
remember that bond.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.060
All right.

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:02.460
You should go.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.560
You don't want your second child

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:34.280
to die like this, do you?

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:37.130
All you need to do is keep silent

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:40.190
and let me stay hidden in Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:42.740
Once I leave,

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.170
your second child

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.940
will return to you unharmed.

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.260
[Grave of Liu Ziqi, beloved son]

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.300
Beat me or scold me if you want,

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:22.540
but let me finish eating first.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.610
I come up the mountain every three days

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:34.060
to leave some flatbread and fruit here.

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:35.410
You can come eat.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.260
Who is he to you?

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.260
He was my child.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.890
When he passed, he was about your age.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.260
Can you teach me how to survive?

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.500
I can't eat grave offerings forever.

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:06.300
All I know is how to kill.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.980
This path will bring you no good.

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:11.850
I killed the members of my opera troupe

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:12.460
and escaped.

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:14.810
I'm already on this path.

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:57.890
I never dare walk past this place

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:00.020
too fast,

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.940
afraid you'll mistake me for an assassin

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.130
and kill me.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.170
I rarely strike without reason.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.260
That is true.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:14.060
Have you found Di Lu?

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:16.260
No.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.020
I checked everyone you told me

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:21.850
to look into.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.570
Nothing seemed off.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.020
If you still don't trust them,

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.650
I can kill them all.

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:36.610
I don't have the patience

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:39.500
to question every one of them.

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:41.500
Don't kill them.

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:44.130
We need every man we have right now.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.890
I'm going away for two days

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:51.260
to take care

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.500
of something important.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:58.540
Do what you must.

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:02.980
It's chilly at night.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:04.890
Keep yourself warm.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:09.500
Hey!

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:10.980
Are you all right?

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:34.690
Ungrateful mutt,

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.130
you're courting death!

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:08.900
Don't run!

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.340
Can you stop chasing me?

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.940
Stop running! Stand still!

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:31.130
This is bad.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:36.900
Don't run!

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:39.990
Stop right there!

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:43.940
Got you!

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.460
So you made me eat like a dog, huh?

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.570
Thought you could outrun me?

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.340
Which one of us looks more like a dog now?

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:23.610
I didn't want to kill anyone.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.340
I'll ask you one last time.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.210
Do you have to go

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:28.980
into Hidden Soldier Alley?

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:29.460
Yes!

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:32.860
Is the Huben Army

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.210
really worth all this?

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.160
If I don't go in, I will die!

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.980
If you go in,

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:41.380
my master dies.

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:42.940
I was sent to the north

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.820
and stayed there for three years.

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.380
I have a wife

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:48.340
and a six-year-old daughter.

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:51.060
The neighbors all thought the man of the house had died.

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:53.730
A rogue at the alley entrance

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.210
set his sights on my wife.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.130
I have to go back and kill him myself.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.290
At the entrance of Wazi Alley in Guiyi Ward,

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.860
there's a breakfast stall.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.210
My wife

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:12.030
often wears

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:14.500
a worn-out purple robe.

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:19.380
Go see for yourself.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.130
Your courtyard

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:38.860
is quiet today.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:41.280
Sit.

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:48.770
In the next few days,

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.170
I need to issue confidential travel passes.

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.940
Wang Pu sent word

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.770
to keep the handlers to a minimum,

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.250
so I sent my helpers home.

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.900
So it seems

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.540
you are no longer suspected.

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.730
Right.

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.340
What are they treating

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.250
as such a big deal?
