[The Vendetta of An]

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.940
[Episode 13]

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.380
[Cangyue Tower]

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.300
Who are you?

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.340
Strange.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.340
Yan Fengshan shouldn't be here this early.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.080
I'm a cripple.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.520
Who do you think I am?

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.340
[Cangyue Tower]

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.460
I, Gu Yu,

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.300
request to see

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:52.800
the regional commanders

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.950
of Long'an,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.530
Beiting, Fanyang, and Zhenxi.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.020
Yan Fengshan abducted me

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.690
to win you over.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.820
But as you

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.170
can see now,

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.300
the Huben Army

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.730
could not even hold a cripple like me.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.890
That alone proves

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.330
Yan Fengshan's strength is spent.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.050
I came unarmed to see you.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.580
I do not fear death.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.050
I only fear

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.420
becoming the shame of Chang'an.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.770
Before you all,

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.300
I will speak plainly.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.790
I have handed the command

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.880
of the Baiwenhu Army to His Majesty.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.860
If you refuse

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.090
to surrender your military seals,

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.180
that is rebellion.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.390
You may kill me

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.420
right here.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.110
But whether I live

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.600
or die

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.660
today,

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.290
my troops

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.290
will march with His Majesty to quell the rebellion.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.580
The Tiemo people hate His Majesty and me

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.150
because when we join hands

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.530
on the battlefield,

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.060
we are not only strong

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.450
but also ruthless.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.180
Yan Fengshan had the Baiwenhu Army ambushed.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.840
Pangtou,

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:10.890

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.040
Wei,

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.290
and Shan were all killed.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.920
So in return, I left him

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.770
a mountain of corpses in Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.460
If you choose treason,

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.980
I will make sure you watch

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.410
with your own eyes

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.910
as every grown man in your households

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:44.810
is killed,

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.560
every woman exiled,

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.850
and every part of your garrisons

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.020
reduced to wasteland.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.700
I, Gu Yu,

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:00.490
always

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.730
keep my word.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.380
[Cangyue Tower]

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.290
At least for now,

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.810
the imperial court has avoided disaster.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:34.610
Next,

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.580
everything rests on whether Huai'an's trap

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.780
can have Yan Fengshan killed.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.100
Mother, all set.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.110
Once I'm done with this one, place it in there too.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.580
I searched everywhere for you.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.220
I thought something had happened.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.370
Those who should be dead are still alive.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:02.660
I won't die yet.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.100
How did it go?

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.490
Just as you ordered,

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.460
the Imperial Guards

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.410
closed nine of the twelve gates.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.020
Only the three western gates remain open.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.230
They also pushed the inspection posts

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.250
five li outward.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:18.900
The travel pass you forged has appeared.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.540
After passing inspection, he entered

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:21.700
through Yanping Gate.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:25.730
How about the deployment?

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.250
Six full battalions are in place.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.290
Xiao Wuyang has set out as well,

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:30.540
carrying that sword of his.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:50.820
The rain

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.820
sounds different than usual.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:57.890
Huai'an,

00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:59.610
you must've been too tired.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:05.700
Maybe.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.010
I've waited

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.250
too long for this moment.

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.650
Greetings,

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.010
Your Majesty.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.610
Five li outside the city,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.610
the one carrying the travel pass you forged

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.340
was dressed in white, wearing a bamboo hat

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.490
with black gauze hanging from it.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.180
It was confirmed.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.940
That man was Yan Fengshan.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:55.980
Our men

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.130
kept a close watch on him.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.460
There were seven people with him,

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.490
all keeping

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.850
a careful distance.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.700
Once he enters the city,

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.650
the signal flag will be raised,

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.100
and we will strike on the spot.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.960
He is Yan Fengshan.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:33.360
Will he come?

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:58.650
Your Majesty,

00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.340
General Gu,

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.370
Mr. Xie Huai'an,

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.180
it's done.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.940
Have you confirmed

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.420
it is Yan Fengshan?

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.220
The soldiers are examining the body.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:09.140
We found this

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.440
on the horse.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:36.890
Let me.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:46.480
Give it to me.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.230
She shed many tears.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:16.530

This is the list of everyone involved

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.140
in this operation.

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:47.220
It is time to face it.

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.040
Five li outside the city,

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.350
the man who passed inspection was Yan Fengshan.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.080
But somewhere along the way,

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.170
Bai Wan was switched in.

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:07.230
That means

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.680
we had long been exposed,

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.600
and the men outside the city

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.460
had long been infiltrated by Huben members.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.460
The three signal officers on the towers

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.640
knew it wasn't Yan Fengshan,

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:24.570
yet they raised the flags anyway,

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:26.330
because

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:29.200
they, too, were Huben members.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.690
It is not hard to identify these people,

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:34.380
but the key lies

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.970
in Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:41.800
General,

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.620
Hidden Soldier Alley is empty.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.750
Does it have another exit?

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.120
Residents of an entire ward,

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.220
thousands of people, have vanished.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.160
There must be another way out.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:55.140
It no longer matters.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:57.030
What matters

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.090
is that Yan Fengshan has returned.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.810
And with all the Huben guards

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.780
from Hidden Soldier Alley,

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:05.050

who do you think

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.900
he would want to strike at the most?

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:11.380
I should return to the palace.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.820
The greatest enemy

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.570
of our lives has appeared.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.350
You may go on grieving,

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.330
but I am going to the palace to support His Majesty.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:05.530
If I die,

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:08.330
I owe you one life for Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:10.680
I will repay it

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.530
in the next life.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.090
With Yan Fengshan back,

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:23.330
I am prepared

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.770
to lose Chang'an,

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.700
but I have never prepared

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.050
for Chang'an to lose Gu Yu.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.080
You cannot die.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.030
Then I hope

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.700
that when we meet again,

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:50.570
I will see a Xie Huai'an

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:52.660
who has stood

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.380
back up.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:57.620
You will.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:07.860
Baiwenhu soldiers, hear my command!

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.370
Yes!

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.490
Follow me to the palace!

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:36.860
Protect His Majesty!

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:13.930
At most two hours from now,

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.260
the city will fall into chaos.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.220
You should leave.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:21.110
I never told her the truth.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.010
I owed her too much.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:26.050
At the very least,

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.610
I should see her off

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:31.020
as family.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.050
Don't worry.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.570
I know every skill

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.090
the Huben guards use.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.770
They cannot kill me.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.500
What happened to her

00:24:50.855 --> 00:25:00.855
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.150
matters deeply

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:54.770
to me.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:57.460
It matters to us too.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.570
Huai'an, don't worry.

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:02.130
I will

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:03.660
keep him safe.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.400
I will not let him

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.360
fall into Yan Fengshan's hands.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:09.170
Go do what you must.

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:25.420
Thank you.

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:28.460
Now go.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:35.810
Use it for protection.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:39.810
Huai'an,

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.180
your white hair draws too much attention.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:43.970
When you go out,

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.290
wear a bamboo hat

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:46.500
to cover it.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:49.180
Huai'an,

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.290
you will come find us, right?

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:53.750
Do not face

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:54.520
Yan Fengshan alone.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.570
When it's time to kill him,

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:00.330
bring the two of us with you.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.610
I have not finished this road yet.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:04.460
Of course

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.700
I'll need you both.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.020
There was a scholar

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.660
named Han Ziling.

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.090
He asked me to give you

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:26.020
this letter.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.460
He said he had

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:29.700
long admired you.

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:32.260
If anything happens to me,

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.370
please give this

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.290
to him.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:42.680
Remember:

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.290
do not fail the expectations

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:48.420
of the scholars of this realm.

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:51.770
Live.

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:56.260
I will.

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.920
Now go.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.720
Why did you return to Chang'an?

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:11.610
It was my fault.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.750
It was my fault.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.550
It was my fault.

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.980
Humans belong to heaven and earth.

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:45.940
Our souls come from the clouds,

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:48.420
our bodies return to the earth.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.090
Heaven and earth leave traces on a person,

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.090
and those traces

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:58.850
can lead one back

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:02.290
to where they once walked.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.020
Mother,

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:50.260
I did something bad!

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.020
Miss.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:56.900
Oh dear.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.180
I'm so sorry,

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.080
truly sorry.

00:29:59.270 --> 00:29:59.940
Look at what you did.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:00.550
It's all right.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:01.680
He didn't do it on purpose.

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:03.030
I simply happened to pass by.

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:05.360
Miss, I'm really sorry.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:06.510
Why don't you

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:08.260
come in and change into something clean?

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:09.680
We have

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:10.870
new clothes,

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:11.400
all clean.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:12.230
They should

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:13.360
fit you well.

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:14.270
It's fine.

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:15.680
I insist.

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:16.790
It was my son's fault.

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:18.200
With your clothes dirty,

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:19.060
you must be uncomfortable.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:20.330
- Come on. - Thank you.

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.680
We don't have much food to offer.

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:26.070
Please make do.

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.830
I've been living on cold, plain food along the way.

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:30.070
A bowl of hot noodles

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:31.030
is more than wonderful.

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:34.470
What is he doing at the door?

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.160
He's waiting for his father.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.070
His father works as a ferryman in Nanwei Trough,

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:42.510
30 or 40 li from here.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:44.360
It's not easy for him to come back,

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.960
but whenever he can find someone to take his place,

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:49.680
even if it means walking a whole day and night,

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:51.400
he'll come home to visit.

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:53.990
Some spend their whole lives walking,

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.120
just to make it home.

00:30:58.170 --> 00:30:59.070
You too, miss?

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:04.720
I've lived in Chang'an for years.

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:06.470
Now I miss home.

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.030
Your father and mother

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:11.600
must be longing for you too.

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.200
To be missed by family

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:15.640
is a blessing.

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:20.360
I think I've heard that...

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:23.260
My husband once said

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.220
he had a ferryman companion.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:26.680
The man said he fled

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:28.220
to Nanwei Trough with his little sister.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:29.900
Then

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:31.310
his sister

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:32.710
was taken in by a family,

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:34.830
and he stayed behind,

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:36.770
working as a ferryman

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:38.050
while watching over her.

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:40.880
He kept watch for seven whole years.

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:43.540
I don't know what disaster

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:44.510
struck their family.

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:46.470
His sister was right beside him,

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:47.360
yet they couldn't reunite.

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:49.470
How bitter that must have been.

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:52.280
That man also told my husband

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:53.990
that having someone to worry about

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:55.230
was a kind of blessing,

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:56.440
just like you said.

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:04.440
Is that ferryman

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:06.700
still in Nanwei Trough?

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:09.270
No.

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:10.830
My husband said something happened,

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:11.920
and he left.

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:14.830
Let me light a lamp for my husband,

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:15.950
so he knows

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:18.790
my son and I are thinking of him.

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:51.640
Sir.

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:55.060
Miss, are you here to offer incense

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:56.110
or seek a divination?

00:32:58.170 --> 00:32:59.030
I came to ask

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:00.270
for a naming slip.

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.590
Has a child been born at home?

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:05.470
Congratulations.

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:07.280
Is it a boy or a girl?

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:10.110
Please, have a seat.

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:16.570
It's not for a child.

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:18.310
It's for myself.

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.620
No one asks for a naming slip

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:23.300
at your age.

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.230
My family suffered a disaster when I was little.

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.330
I was separated from a family member for many years.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:34.470
Recently, I found him again.

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:36.400
This naming slip

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:37.830
is to reclaim my true name

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:39.510
and restore my ties with him.

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:46.120
To spend half a lifetime adrift

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.550
and still find your family again

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:51.070
is no easy thing.

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.230
Fate parts people

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:56.880
but also brings them back together.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:05.180
So, for this naming slip, I will write...

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.350
Do you still remember

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.480
your name after all these years?

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:13.520
My family name is Liu.

00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:16.560
I've carried this amulet

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:18.830
for as long as I can remember.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:21.520
I never understood its meaning,

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:23.600
but now I do.

00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:28.720
My given name is written on it.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:29.890
[Li]

00:34:29.890 --> 00:34:30.520
A single character:

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:32.200
Li.

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:42.120
Then for the blessing,

00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:44.160
I will write:

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:47.270
"May you find home again

00:34:47.890 --> 00:34:49.480
and know lasting peace."

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:50.720
How does that sound?

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:53.480
Thank you, sir.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:05.000
[Liu Li: May you find home again and know lasting peace.]

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:13.680
[Liu Li]

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.600
[Bai Wan]

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.120
[Liu Li]

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:32.480
Liu Li,

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:35.200
so you

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:41.270
came back to reunite with me?

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.240
[Liu Li]

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:37.480
Take care. Goodbye.

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:42.480
[Chen Zhiying of the Huben Army]

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:08.750
Can you promise that?

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.590
Of course I can.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:13.200
Then will you write to me

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:14.270
to tell me you're safe?

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:16.720
Wherever you go,

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:18.350
write to me every year,

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:20.000
so I know

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:21.790
you're safe.

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:24.600
She's your sister,

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:26.350
yet you let her reunite with another family.

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:28.560
You've been a ferryman here

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.560
for seven years, three li from her home,

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.000
just to protect her from afar.

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:34.910
How long can you keep this up?

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:37.120
I don't know.

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:40.270
I only hope

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:43.350
she never remembers her past.

00:37:58.170 --> 00:37:58.790
That night,

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:01.270
I hid behind the wall

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:04.040
and saw someone feeding you soup.

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:06.290
You were

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:08.950
surrounded by people

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:11.270
who cared for you.

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:13.950
At that moment,

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:16.910
I decided to leave you with that family.

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:19.040
I thought

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:22.280
that if I was careful enough,

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.720
you would live a safe life.

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:32.680
Liu Li,

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:37.270
I was wrong.

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:40.790
When the time comes, I will reunite

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:43.430
with you, Father, and Mother.

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:46.230
The four of us

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:50.200
will be together again.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:11.760
[Incense]

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:22.480
Is it

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:23.520
a funeral?

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:27.790
The whole city is under martial law,

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:29.040
killings everywhere.

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:31.870
Even the city gates have changed hands several times.

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:32.950
And you...

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.480
You have to go through this on the very day

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:37.950
the court is thrown into chaos.

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:41.170
Everyone suffers.

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.230
Everyone suffers!

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:45.120
Sir,

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:45.910
please come in.

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:51.430
Do you need a memorial tablet made?

00:39:57.690 --> 00:39:58.560
Who

00:39:59.210 --> 00:39:59.910
is it for?

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:00.750
What should it say?

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:06.080
It is

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:09.230
for my late sister, Liu Li.

[Late Sister Liu Li]

[Yan Fengshan]

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:26.350
In this courtyard,

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:29.260
I can almost see the traces of my old friends.

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:32.320
When you have time, ask around at the brokerages.

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.120
If it can be bought,

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:35.870
buy this place.

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:37.790
It is indeed a fine courtyard.

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:40.160
Convenient for cooking.

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:43.000
I will go to the brokers tomorrow.

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:47.520
General...

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:34.270
The Liu family's child is buried here.

00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:36.120
From this day on,

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:38.830
no one is allowed to set foot on this patch of land.

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:40.680
Understood.

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:42.640
General,

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:44.870
we have taken the Imperial City.

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:46.040
But

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:47.350
the 400 men we first sent

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:48.380
to assassinate Xiao Wuyang

00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:49.520
were all lost.

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:51.950
We found no trace of him.

00:42:57.250 --> 00:42:57.870
What about Gu Yu?

00:42:58.210 --> 00:42:59.160
Gu Yu led

00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:00.040
two 100-man Baiwenhu units

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:01.350
and tried to enter the Imperial City.

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:02.560
We surrounded them.

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:04.120
His men fought desperately

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.120
to break him out.

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:06.910
By the time they reached Yongchang Ward,

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:08.310
all the Baiwenhu soldiers had fallen,

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:09.480
and Gu Yu

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:11.120
disappeared.

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:14.230
Lock down the area surrounding the Imperial City,

00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:16.560
stretching west to Guangde Ward, east to Xuanyang Ward,

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:18.680
and south to the outer streets

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:19.680
of Jingzhao Prefecture.

00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:22.120
Both of them are injured.

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:23.390
If they want to hide,

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:25.560
it can only be within this area.

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:27.350
Find them.

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:29.040
Understood.

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:34.870
All 12 gates of Chang'an

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:36.600
are now under Huben guards' control.

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.040
Xiao Wuyang stationed the Wuyang Army

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:40.200
30 li outside the city,

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:42.750
but as you ordered,

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:44.830
the armies of the four regional commanders

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:45.640
set out ahead of schedule

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:48.200
and have now arrived near Chang'an.

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:49.910
Their forces outnumber the Wuyang Army

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:50.560
three to one

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:52.120
and have kept them in check.

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:53.750
Then that leaves

00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:55.680
only the north.

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:57.270
Send a messenger to Tiemo

00:43:57.660 --> 00:43:58.640
and have them hold back

the main Baiwenhu forces.

00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:01.080
As long as they don't march south,

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:03.830
Chang'an is ours.

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:05.160
I will go.

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:06.160
