[Yearning Day and Night]

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.110
Does Jin Zhao

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.920
have a girlfriend?

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.640
I think the answer to your question

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.780
is right on that ornament.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.190
It should be attached
to a certain key, I think.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.320
If you have time,

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.060
you can go find it,

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.000
and then you'll know the answer.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.200
Here! The freshly cut meat is ready.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.730
I'm warning you.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.920
Don't look at me with such adoring eyes.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.520
I've been single for so long
that even Xishi at the door

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.110
looks pretty to me.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.270
What's making you so happy?

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.150
Sanlai, you're such a good man.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.660
Well, what's going on?

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.930
Have you really fallen for me?

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.650
Stop being so full of yourself.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.060
Come on, take a big bite.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.240
I thought you didn't like
fennel dumplings.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.240
I don't know,

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.300
but today's filling

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.720

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.079
You must be hungry

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.480
let me get you a meatball.

Fine, I won't get it. Come on.

Are you really crazy?

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.029
Brandy is here,

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:23.360
and you persuaded Jiang Mu into drinking?

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.160
-Exactly.
-Just drink the whole bottle yourself.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:27.830
Have one drink with me.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:28.710
-Sure.
-Drink with me.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:29.910
I'll finish mine.
You guys help yourselves.

Let's drink then. Come on.

Jiang Mu,
would you like something to drink?

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.320
Soda, please.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.640
Do you want ice?

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.710
Okay, any other requests?

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.740
I want Jin Zhao to get my drink.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:42.500
Alright.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.030
-Come on, cheers.
-Come on.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.030
So I'm drinking alone?

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.760
What a waste.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.020
Alright, alright.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.230
Brandy,

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.310
I want a cold drink too!

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.000
I've looked into

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.200
the Scramble for you.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.800
It was the fruit farmers nearby
who did it.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.470
They sprinkled water on the track.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.890
They said they took money from Wan Dayong.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.880
It's okay.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.820
She knows everything.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.880
In the previous Scramble,

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.470
she was my navigator.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.150
Navigator?

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.200
Mu,

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.390
do you know what a navigator

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.520
means to a driver?

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.470
It's like a lover.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.830
She can make a driver successful

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.350
or get a driver killed.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.230
Brandy used to

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.270
never trust anyone easily.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.830
Come on, join the table.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.090
You're holding us up. Shuffle the tiles.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.590

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.560
-What kind of play is that?
-I knew it.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.150
-And you played the Two of Bamboos.
-Kong the Two of Bamboos.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.420
Two of Bamboos. Your turn.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.740
Brandy, hurry up.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.440
Let me have one.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.390
-One tile away.
- One of Bamboos.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.790
-One of Bamboos. No One of Bamboos.
-Four of Characters.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:45.970
No Four of Characters.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.230
I just need one more tile to win.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.350
-Why are you holding my tile?
-Five of Circles.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.280
Five of Circles.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.480
That's the Five of Bamboos.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.150
-Five of Bamboos.
-Crazy.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.760
Crazy, are you deceiving me?

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.520
-Well, you...
-Six of Circles.

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.110
Are you leaving?

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.170
What else would I do?

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:10.040
When we were little,

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.800
we always stayed up
for New Year's Eve together.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.470
You were afraid I couldn't fall asleep,

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.130
so you always told me
many interesting stories.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:20.670
You haven't told me stories
for a long time.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:27.470
But every time,

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:31.070
you couldn't even stay awake
through one story.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.130
This time I definitely won't fall asleep.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.110
You're not a child anymore.

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:52.110
I'll always be younger than you.

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:57.110
Please?

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:07.790
One hour at most.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:59.930
I fell asleep by accident.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:01.750
Where are you? I'll come find you.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:02.640
Don't rush.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:04.510
Take your time getting ready.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:05.840
Have something to eat first.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.500
I'll wait for you downstairs.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.550
How long have you been waiting?

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:35.800
I couldn't reach you by phone.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.860
So I just came over.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:39.910
Why didn't you come up to wake me?

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.660
It was still early.

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:44.770
I wanted to let you sleep a bit longer.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.500
Give me the car key.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:50.990
What for?

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:52.280
Give it to me.

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:58.420
Let me remind you,

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:00.360
do you even have a driver's license?

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.690
-Can you drive?
-Get in.

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:26.510
It's your New Year's gift.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:27.680
How do you like it?

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.160
Who taught you that?

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:31.840
Sanlai said

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.290
drifting is the best way to pick up girls.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.440
I was curious,

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.550
so I learned it.

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:40.640
You haven't answered me yet.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.840
Do you like it?

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.280
I like it.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.640
This is the best gift I've ever received.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.790
Really?

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.780
Then I'll go do another drift.

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:51.420
Wait.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:54.310
Take the passenger seat.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.170
I'll do a drift.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:42.410
This is my return gift for you.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.270
Brandy!

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.310
Sorry.

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:07.910
Sorry, I got stuck in traffic.

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:08.470
Sanlai.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.270
I'm late.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.060
What kind of tree is this?

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.510
This one?

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.470
This is our wishing tree.

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:16.770
We call it Tree God.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:18.270
It's very powerful.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.790
Ask for wealth, and you'll get it.

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.590
When it comes to asking for love,

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:23.190
it's even more effective.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:22.230
Jiang Mu,

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:24.250
you need to tell your wish
to the Tree God.

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:25.710
Only then can it bless you.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:29.940
Tree God, Tree God,

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:31.680
I wish everyone safe and healthy

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.270
in the new year.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.220
And please bless Zhao and me...

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:53.750
You've been talking
to the Tree God for so long.

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:55.410
You must have many loved ones.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.770
Don't be ridiculous. Just one.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.330
The lion dance is starting over there.

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.590
I heard it's a lion dance team from China.

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:26.130
Let's go. The lion dance is starting.

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:28.230
Lion dance? Let's go, come on.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.400
I forgot this is my zodiac year.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.520
I need to get something red.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.270
You go ahead.
I'll meet you at the parking lot.

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:57.110
See you later.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.310
It's starting. It's starting.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:04.750
Excuse me.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.390
It's too crowded here. What if I get lost?

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:55.640
You did this for...

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:22.830
I didn't mean to.

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:48.250
I didn't expect the temple fair here
would be quite lively.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.700
I'll bring you here next time.

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:55.330
Brandy?

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:05.690
Let's go.

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:10.030
You're acting like you didn't see us.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:11.160
Where are you going?

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.530
Although we don't work together,

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:14.610
we're not complete strangers, right?

00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:15.170
Come on.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:17.780
Extend your New Year greetings to Mr. Wan.

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:21.590
Follow me.

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:28.000
I'm talking to you.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.550
Extend your New Year greetings to Mr. Wan.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:31.640
Out of the way.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.260
Out of the way?

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:35.150
Are they getting in your way?

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.750
I think you

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:38.480
don't want to leave here alive.

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:43.500
What are you doing?

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:47.900
Move aside.

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:49.380
You have no manners.

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:53.220
Brandy is senior to all of you.

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:55.560
Is this how you were taught to behave?

00:28:59.160 --> 00:28:59.890
Brandy.

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:02.370
I was thinking of gathering
some old friends

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:04.600
on the fourth or fifth days
of the lunar New Year.

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.800
We're not that close.

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:07.810
Let's skip the gathering.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:19.530
We don't have to eat together.

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:21.460
But let's be clear about one thing.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.230
I heard

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.570
you're planning to interfere
with the business in Xikouguan.

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:35.230
Quite ambitious, aren't you?

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:38.160
Xikouguan?

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:41.550
Whether I interfere or not
isn't up to you.

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:42.880
It's not up to me either.

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:44.250
We'll see who has what it takes.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:45.600
You're really something,

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.870
climbing the ranks ahead of others

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:47.680
and getting so much attention

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.270
in such a short time.

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:50.710
Aren't you obviously

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:52.470
going against Mr. Wan?

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:53.760
Let me tell you,

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:55.240
don't be naive.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.060
It's not too late to back off now.

00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:58.360
Back off?

00:29:58.880 --> 00:29:59.920
What does he mean?

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.660
You're so confident
that I'm targeting you?

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:04.830
Why would I go after you?

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:09.880
Alright, alright.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.380
What are you doing?
We're all friends here.

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.310
You shouldn't have pointed at him.

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:17.780
Brandy, you don't even know.

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:18.690
Just recently,

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:20.440
Qing argued with me for days

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.970
because of your situation.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:23.460
It seems

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.720
my daughter has feelings for you.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.380
I know you're a small business owner now.

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:31.390
Whether big or small business,

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:34.150
business thrives on harmony.

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:36.840
Why lose together
when we can win together,

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:37.430
right?

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.320
How do we both win?

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.470
I like ambitious young people,

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:43.880
but they

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.750
fall into 2 categories for me:

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:47.120
insiders and outsiders.

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.960
What difference

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:53.540
does it make?

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:55.670
Brandy.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:59.980
How well I treat my daughter

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.790
is exactly how well I'll treat
my future son-in-law.

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:34.410
But if someone's an outsider,

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:39.410
I can't control what happens.

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:42.480
Can't control it.

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:04.560
What era are we in? Arranged marriages?

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:06.160
How outdated can you be?

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.160
Who do we have here?

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.990
Shouting through a megaphone.

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:13.650
Turns out it's Lai Qide's son.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.230
I was drinking with your father
before the New Year.

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:18.360
He said you haven't been home for ages.

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.710
Next time you have dinner with my dad,

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.770
could you remind him of something?

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:24.190
To pay back the money.

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:26.280
That's not my business.

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:28.630
I don't want to get involved
in your father-son issues.

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:30.360
But my friendship with your father

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.680
goes way back.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.710
Let me tell you,

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.730
you'd better not interfere

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.780
with my business with Brandy.

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:39.180
You and my dad go way back.

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:40.550
What a coincidence.

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:42.800
Brandy and I are quite acquainted as well.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:43.660
I'm definitely

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:45.690
getting involved in this matter.

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:50.090
Come down. Come down.

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:51.820
My neck hurts looking up at you.

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:52.430
Come down.

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:53.770
It's too high here.

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:54.890
I'm afraid to jump.

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:57.360
But if you feel uncomfortable,

00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.210
you can come up here.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:02.410
We've arrived at our scenic spot!

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:05.280
Take photos.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.550
Who can take our picture?

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:09.830
Li, of course.

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.120
He can do it!

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:13.960
Give me a break.
You know how to take photos?

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:14.640
Get out of here.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.500
Excuse me, we can take your photo!

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.930
We're really good at it!

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.510
H-He's really good at it.

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:20.200
He can take photos.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.030
I'll join you.

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:23.890
Thank you, young man. Come on.

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:30.740
Dad, forget it.

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.870
Alright. Stand still. You look beautiful.

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:34.870
Take a nice photo.

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:36.550
Take more pictures.

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:37.750
Make us look younger.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.860
Young man, come down
and take a photo with us!

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:43.400
Coming! Wait for me. Just a second!

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.790
They're leaving. They're leaving.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:47.970
Coming! Coming!

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:50.870
Coming!

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:53.230
Come on. Let's do this together.

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:55.640
Come here, handsome.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.470
Let's see how your photos turned out,
handsome.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.730
They turned out great. Let's take a look.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:03.810
I'll head upstairs first.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:17.239
What's wrong?

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.050
Don't want to leave?

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.469
No way.

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:24.960
Bye, Sanlai.

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:26.230
Bye.

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:39.360
Don't you think Jiang Mu looks

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:42.630
really pretty dressed like this?

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:48.239
Did you just hold her hand?

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:56.989
I was afraid she'd overthink it.

00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:59.040
Afraid she'd overthink it?

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:03.150
Do you even know what she was thinking?
And you worry she would overthink?

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:04.980
Thinking is one thing,
but why did you hold her hand?

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:06.110
Did I hold your hand?

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:09.270
Why are you so worked up?

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:14.610
Brandy, Brandy.

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:17.080
Your karma has arrived.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:20.840
I told you.

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:22.060
You shouldn't...

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:24.280
Well, you shouldn't always reject women.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.720
I'm telling you, if you reject too many,

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.840
when someone you really care about

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:27.470
comes along,

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:29.870
your karma will catch up with you,
you know?

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:47.020
Qing.

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:51.050
What are you doing?

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:54.710
Get lost.

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.240
You want to fight?

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:04.350
Fine.

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:05.630
I'm game.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:50.750
Bear with it.

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.040
Does it hurt a lot?

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.030
Done.

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:51.570
Let's do the other one.

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:00.870
You can't replace him.

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:47.760
Coming to wish me a happy New Year?

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:48.880
Wan Qing likes you.

00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:00.060
If you don't like her,
stay the hell away from her.

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:02.520
Your feelings for Snakey
are your business.

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.300
Don't drag me into it.

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:05.550
If it weren't for you,

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:07.730
she wouldn't be so heartbroken.

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:15.850
You're pathetic.

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:30.640
Enough.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.110
I have someone I need to protect.
