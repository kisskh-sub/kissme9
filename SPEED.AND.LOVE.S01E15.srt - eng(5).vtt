00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:37.840

want with you?

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.520
I'm going to sell the garage.

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:51.440
Sell?

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:55.070
You're not going
to run the garage anymore?

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:57.570
I'll run it for now.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.880
Until when?

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:00.670
One month at most.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.360
Are you sure you want to talk about this?

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:09.389

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:14.020
When did I say I missed you?

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:18.440
Then why did you
call my name so many times?

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.239
I did not.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:26.840
Well, I missed you.

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:04.400

Coming.

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:28.350
You can exchange these points
for 5 kg of rice.

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:29.980
Impressive, right?

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:33.870
It took me several months,

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.100
and they only let me play
five times a day.

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:39.770
First place gets 200 grains.

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:41.430
Mu,

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:43.680
the turtle hasn't been fed today.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.010
Could you feed it for me?

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:50.550
First place gets 200 grains,

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:52.280
second place gets 100,

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.090
and third place gets 50.

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:56.630
Only when you save up 10,000 grains,

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:58.840
can you exchange them for 5 kg of rice.

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:01.590
You need rice at home?

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.280
This thing sparked my competitiveness.

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:07.970
You're quite persistent.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.020
Let me write down the address.

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.920
If they didn't limit me
to five games a day,

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.880
I could have redeemed

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.280
15 kg.

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:20.390
Or even 20 kg by now.

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.110
All done. Just wait for the rice at home.

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:25.510
-All done?
-I'm leaving.

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:26.360

with some new dishes recently.

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:34.650
You can also try the rice I exchanged.

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:36.600
Sure, when I finish my work.

Zhao,

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.510
I've prepared a New Year's gift for you.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.240
You'll see it soon.

00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:58.870
What is it?

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:02.630
I don't know if you'll like it.

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:09.450
Go to sleep.

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:12.380
I like

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:14.720
anything from you.
