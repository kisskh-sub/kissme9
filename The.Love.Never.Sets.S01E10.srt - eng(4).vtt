00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.720
Be with me?

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.920
Okay, my girlfriend.~

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.000
Okay.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.160
I realized I like you.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.400
Can you like me back?

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.800
What are you doing?!

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.560
Mom!

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.440
Dad is gone.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.000
Then...

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.760
Then why didn’t you tell me?

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.400
Didn't you tell me not to contact you?

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.119
You don’t have to be afraid of anything now.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.600
From now on, I'll be by your side.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.080
Ice!

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.560
Dad, is this him?

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.440
Yes.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.320
Why did you never tell me

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.360
that my brother was this handsome?

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.040
Are you leaving already?

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.480
I was going to invite you to stay for dinner.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'm going to leave now.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.000
Thank you so much for inviting me.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.560
Happy birthday in advance.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.720
Take this to have on the way.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.640
Thank you.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.440
It's almost Ice's birthday.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.400
Happy birthday in advance!

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.320
Thank you.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.720
Next time we're in Bangkok,

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.720
let's have dinner.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.240
Sure.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.400
Thank you.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.000
But I have to go now.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.640
Well..

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.280
Good bye.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.880
You should go.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.960
I'll take care of this.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.720
Thank you.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.880
Good bye.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.280
Good bye.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.240
(I hope you enjoy it.)

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.640
I invited you all here.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.560
Because I want to talk to the director.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.280
I understand you're filming a short film.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.000
So is this a scene from the film or what.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.520
It was during a break.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.560
And did they have to hug.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.280
Uncle.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.880
That day Ice’s mom.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.440
She arrived right when we were filming.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.959
And Ice had a small misunderstanding with his mom.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.440
So Saint went to comfort him.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.160
That’s all.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.760
Yes.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.200
As a director, if the actors aren’t comfortable.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
It’s hard to continue shooting.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.960
But if outsiders see this.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.840
They’ll think differently.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.480
I don’t think there’s anything strange here, uncle.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.280
So does that mean you and Saint.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.600
Are actually dating?

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.000
Yes, we’ve been together for a long time.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.560
As friends.

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.240
Friends?!

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.240
I’d never think of Saint as anything more.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.840
Mr.Khom.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.880
Mom.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:11.920
What is this.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.000
I was investigating the short film they shot.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
But now I’m suspicious about something else.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.280
So what exactly are Lanee and Saint?

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.520
Are they dating? Mrs.Jan?

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.400
I’ll speak with my daughter first.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.800
I’ll go too.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.360
What is going on, Lanee?

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.440
I want to know everything.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.760
Actually.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.440
I’m dating Sea.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.840
Why?

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:00.160
You’ve never told me anything.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.600
I’m sorry mom.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.200
But I’ve been really uncomfortable.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.760
And I think I need to tell you.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
That I don’t like Saint.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.240
You can be angry at me.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.560
But I just don’t want to lie to myself anymore.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
I don’t want to lie to others.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.440
And I don’t want to lie to you anymore.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.760
Lanee.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.440
If you told me earlier.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.920
I wouldn’t have arranged your engagement with Saint.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.560
What do you mean?

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.920
Since you said you’re dating Sea.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.280
I'm not stopping you.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.400
But

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.720
the problem now is,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.680
I need to clear things up with Saint’s dad.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.640
I have one last question for you.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.240
Yes.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.920
What are you and Saint?

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.680
We’re just actors working together.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.320
I think it’s normal.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.440
For actors to support each other.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.080
Saint and I are professional.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.000
We don’t bring personal feelings into work.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.760
If you have questions about the filming process.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.200
You can ask me.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.640
Mr.Khom.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
We need to talk.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.880
Yes, Mrs.Jan.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.920
Will you be okay.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.120
If our kids don’t get engaged.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.640
Our kids must get married.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.200
My daughter is dating Sea.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.880
And I let her choose who she likes.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.680
About making the kids post their online status

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.440
as dating..

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.840
I think we should remove it.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.840
If we announce they’re not together.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.159
Investors will pull out.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.240
Mr. Khom.

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:41.840
You need to accept reality.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.200
And I’m sure.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.640
You already have a backup plan.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.800
Right?

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.240
I think for now.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.960
We shouldn’t do anything

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.760
that will alarm the investors.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.720
I think.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.680
I need to reconsider you again.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.040
Sorry.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.720
For bringing you to meet my dad.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.160
It’s okay.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.760
How was my acting?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.440
Did I really look stressed?

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.080
Saint and I work professionally.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.760
Don’t worry.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.440
I’m fine.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.920
Wait.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.200
Saint.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.520
Is my Dad still making you follow me?

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.840
I’m really sorry.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.120
I don’t want to do this.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.800
I’ve been following you guys on set.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.080
Now I can’t keep up with class.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.680
If you don’t want to do it then

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.680
why do it.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.760
I have to.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.480
If I don’t.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.560
Your dad won’t keep me and my mom.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.440
I don’t know if

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.480
You two actually like each other or not.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.120
But I have my own life.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.000
If possible.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.320
I want you two to

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.560
cause less drama and be less suspicious.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.480
So I won’t have to follow you anymore.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.040
Tonight you two should stay separately.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.200
Because your dad wants me and my mom to

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.800
monitor you both.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.360
I’ll go then.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.280
Woo!

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.840
And now we have

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.400
the last two awards.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.480
The two songs announced

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.880
will be performed at the university countdown event

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.800
on New Year’s Eve.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.800
And without further delay.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.640
The first runner-up award.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.800
Goes to!!

00:11:52.800 --> 00:12:01.200
Red Sunflower!

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.560
to Red Sunflower!!!

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.120
By Karun Thongdee.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.760
Woohoo!! Yay!!

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.760
Yes.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.680
Great job everyone.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.200
Amazing.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:12.960
Yes.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.520
Let’s go.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.280
Ice let’s go.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.440
Woohoo!!

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.360
Let’s go.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.920
I told you we could do it.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.440
I loved it, I loved it too.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.200
Yes.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.960
Hello.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.920
Hello.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.120
Let’s invite the university president.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.000
Mr.Nikom Saengarunawong to present the award

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.040
and take some photos.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.880
Let it stay a secret love,

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.600
like the lyrics say.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:03.880
Thank you.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.920
Let’s get a photo of the whole band.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.000
Is there something you dislike?

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.680
Since you gave it zero points.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.440
Music is subjective, Mrs.Jan.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.200
Oh.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.000
I see.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.480
Seems like our preferences.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.040
Are very different.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.320
(Scores for Songwriting Competition 2025)

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.360
(Total: 0/100)

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.440
Woo!

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.280
Ice.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.560
You’re incredible.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.720
Second place.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.520
Mud, sit down. This my homie!

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.240
I told you Ice has talent.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.520
Because you helped me record it.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.960
You helped me so much.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.360
So cool, bro.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.360
Come on, let's celebrate.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.000
Let's go!

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:10.920
One time!

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.160
Yay!

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:14.920
Ice,

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.920
isn't Saint going to come?

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.640
He's not coming.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.560
Probably busy with stuff at home.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.440
Oh.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.680
And you, did you get

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.600
an idea for the song performance yet?

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.160
I’ve thought of some ideas.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.480
But nothing solid yet.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.000
Ice, you can schedule practice with me tomorrow.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.800
Maybe while practicing,

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.320
you’ll think of something.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.160
Music practice?

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:46.680
Yes!

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.560
I’m free anyway.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:49.600
Are you free?

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.280
Yeah.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.800
We’ll go.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.880
We won’t miss it.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.000
Really.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.560
Let me come too.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.960
Hey, I’ll find a practice room for you guys.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:58.920
Don’t worry about me.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.680
Then

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.360
tomorrow let’s practice music together.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.280
Let’s do it.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.520
Let’s do it!

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.200
Woohoo!

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.400
Music practice, bro!

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.280
Hey,

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.560
we still don’t have a club group photo.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.400
Should we take a group picture.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.280
Yeah sure!

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:15.920
That's a good idea.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.720
How do we take it?

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.240
Well,

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.000
who will take it.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:19.720
Me?

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.720
Is that okay.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.360
Okay.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.320
Okay.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.840
Okay.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.560
Here.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.080
Okay.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:25.960
Closer.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:26.480
Okay.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.560
Everyone ready.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.240
Ready.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.560
One.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.840
Two.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:34.520
Three.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Today I got scolded by my dad again.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.640
Just accept it.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.880
Your dad won’t let you go easily.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.160
Yeah.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.960
When will I get to be with Ice?

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.960
There will be a day.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.520
When your dad accepts it.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.200
Oh.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.080
Oh, Saint.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.760
Don’t tell me you’re sleeping here again?

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.200
Then where am I supposed to sleep?

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.600
You two sleep in that room.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.200
I’ll sleep here.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:33.920
Okay.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:34.720
Mud.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.800
Didn’t you say you wouldn’t get drunk.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.280
Huh.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.600
Didn’t you say you wouldn’t get drunk.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.800
I am drunk.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.760
Book, do you know.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.560
Ten didn’t walk me home.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.080
Such a shitty person.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.680
He ran off before it was even dark.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.280
But at least Ice came to drop me off.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.240
Otherwise I’d be wasted.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:55.960
What?

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.440
Go shower first.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.920
Can I just sleep. You reek of alcohol.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.720
Go. I’ll just sleep.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.800
Go shower.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.040
I’ll shower tomorrow.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.280
Go shower.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.800
I'll take one tomorrow.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.880
Then I’ll take you.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:11.520
Will you go.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.520
But you have to wash me.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.680
I’ll take you.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.160
How is it going to be?

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.160
Okay, okay.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.280
Let’s go.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.079
Let’s go.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.200
Fast.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.359
Go quickly.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.240
I’m going to shower with my boyfriend, Saint.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.440
See you, bro.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.000
Go fast.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.200
It’s cold.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.600
Next time don’t drink so much.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.560
Then what should I do?

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.680
My heart loves it.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.000
Are you addicted to alcohol?

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:22.840
Not addicted to alcohol.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.200
I’m addicted to you.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.680
Love you.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.600
What are you saying.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.240
Wait.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.720
Saint is here.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.520
Good,

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.000
makes it exciting.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.440
Hello.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:21.880
Who is this?

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:22.920
It’s me.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.040
Saint.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.000
I’m using Book’s phone to call.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:28.960
Oh.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.200
I’m not coming back to the room tonight.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.440
I know.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.960
Congrats

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.560
on the award.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.120
Thanks.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.520
You can come take pictures with the trophy too.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.360
I brought it to the room already.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:46.680
Sure.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:47.960
Yeah.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.720
And the headphones

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.040
with your engraved name arrived yet?

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.520
Yeah.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:56.440
Thanks.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.400
It arrived faster than I expected.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.880
I like it.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.560
It’s nothing.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.240
Ice.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:12.760
I’m sorry.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.320
For just standing there today.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.880
You handled everything alone.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.680
This is already good enough.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.440
Bear.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.440
I’m sorry.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.320
That I used the song you helped write

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.720
and didn’t credit you.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.880
It’s okay.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.920
This song is my gift to you.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.520
Yeah.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.360
Our lives right now are like the poet Li Bai.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.840
How?

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.200
Are you going to jump into the river

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.040
and chase the moon?

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.360
If I could, I would.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.880
Then why didn’t you come?

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.640
Your dad’s henchman isn’t following you anymore,

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.600
right?

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.320
And where’s my phone

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.400
Give it to Book.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.680
But anyway tomorrow.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.360
You have to come see me.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.560
Yeah.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:31.240
Okay.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.880
I’ll hurry to you tomorrow.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:36.720
Good night.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.320
Good night.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.360
When did you come back?

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.200
A while ago.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.280
I saw your trophy.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.720
It's not only my trophy.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.800
It’s your trophy too.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.760
Is this washed already?

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.240
Yeah.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.120
But

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.520
there are still the white clothes

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.520
that haven’t been washed yet.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.840
Hey, do you have any?

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.040
Then we can wash them together with this pile.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:44.480
Yeah, I do.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.160
A lot too.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.200
Don’t forget your in-ears in your pocket again.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:11.920
Are you crazy?

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.760
If I forget them, the one who’ll be sad is you.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.480
Yeah right.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.760
Come on,

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.920
I’ll help hang them.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.760
By the way,

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.120
this feels like that scene we filmed, right?

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
The one where Seen and Kit were hanging clothes.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.440
Hey!

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:47.880
So that's how you're going to play?

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:48.520
Come on.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.880
Doesn’t look like it at all.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.560
In that scene…

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.880
they were about to kiss, right?

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.400
What kiss?

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.400
I mean the scene where the mom interrupted them

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.400
and found out that Seen and Kit liked each other?

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.600
But

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.840
the mom isn’t here yet.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.160
Hello, Pas?

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.640
Hello, Ice.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.280
The music practice room is full,

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.560
so we’re thinking of practicing

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.000
at my home studio instead.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.440
Sure.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.280
Can you send me the location

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.520
so I can go there?

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.000
No need,

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.640
I’ll pick you up.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.520
Uh…

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.440
Okay..

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.080
Then I’ll send you my location.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:00.840
You’re going to practice?

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:02.720
Yeah.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.520
I’ll drive you.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.400
Hey,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:06.800
it’s fine.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.200
Pas is coming to pick me up.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.200
I’ll take you myself.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.120
Hey.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.880
Just drop me here.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:32.560
Today…

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.040
Can I go in and watch you practice?

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:35.960
Huh?

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.200
Ice.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.120
Hi, Pas.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.640
Am I late?

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.240
No, not at all.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.280
Ten and Mud just arrived too.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.760
How did Saint end up dropping you off?

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.320
Uh..

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.800
Well, I was with Ice.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:57.880
Pas,

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.680
can I watch you and Ice practice today?

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.080
Ice, is that okay?

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.600
Yeah, it’s fine.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Just relax.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.960
Make yourself at home.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.120
Your place is really cozy.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.480
Do you collect vintage stuff too?

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.160
Oh.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.520
These are all my dad’s.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.880
He likes vintage things.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:30.800
Pas!

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.720
This one is a rare model!

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.720
I remember there are only like 200 of these.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.320
Yeah.

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.200
My dad bought it for my mom

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.760
when he proposed to her.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.840
And you, Ice? Is there a guitar you want?

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.600
Of course.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.520
What model? Tell me,

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.720
maybe I can find it for you.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.360
Well…

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.360
actually…

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.160
from this brand.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.840
Oh. It looks pretty similar.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.200
(Thank you for coming into my life)

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.040
(as a ray of sunshine,)

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:06.640
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:11.120
(from once withered to bloom again.)

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:15.320
(Thank you for making everyday)

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.160
(no longer lonely as it once was.)

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:22.040
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:28.480
(Always Red Sunflower of yours.)

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.120
Whoa.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.080
This mic sounds insanely good.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.200
Of course it does.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.680
This is the Sennheiser MD 421.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.200
Almost twenty thousand baht each.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.800
You can use it for concerts and studio recording.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.480
Do you like it?

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.760
I do.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.640
Then I’ll give it to you.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:54.640
Pas.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.560
No, it’s okay.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.760
I can’t accept it.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.600
Just think of it as your birthday present.

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.840
I really can’t, I’d feel too bad.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:07.560
Keep it.

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:08.920
I really want you to use it.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:10.440
Okay.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.640
Sure. Thank you so much.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.240
So, how was what we practiced earlier?

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.200
Was it okay?

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.880
Yeah.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.640
I think the instruments were a bit loud at the start.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.640
Maybe if we bring Ice’s vocal up, it’d be clearer?

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.480
Hey, Saint,

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.160
you know music too?

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.240
No.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.480
I just think listeners

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.360
would want to hear Ice’s voice clearly.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.720
Hmm.

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.760
He’s right.

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.920
Then let’s give Ice a solo for the first verse.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.000
The rest of us will come in

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.560
on verse 2 and 3.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.480
Ice, you can do a low baritone there.

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.000
I’ll follow a bit behind.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.400
Let’s make it verse 3 a dominant chord.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.680
It's a C#7.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.920
Let’s switch to A, then C#7,

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.360
then F# minor, how’s that? Yeah.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.840
Yeah, that works. Yes, perfect.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:08.280
Okay.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.360
Let’s run it again.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.200
Yep.

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.240
Ice?

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.520
Should we try flying a drone like this?

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.600
It looks cool.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.840
Aren’t you going overboard?

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.080
It’s just a university project.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.640
We’ll think about it later.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.160
Let’s continue practice.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:31.880
Chord.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.320
Okay everyone, let’s keep going.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:34.960
Okay.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.000
Alright, ready?

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.640
Let’s try again.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.240
If you’re stressed,

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.120
why not let the music carry you a bit?

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.880
Do you always play music when you’re stressed?

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:34.240
Yep.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.520
I think everyone has a song

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:41.280
or melody they use to heal themselves.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.400
Do you have one?

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.000
I used to.

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.680
But now…

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.000
I feel like my song

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.240
is becoming someone else’s song somehow.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.280
Oh?

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.920
Why do you think that?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.320
Maybe someone else

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.280
can play that song better than me.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.200
Hmm.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.240
I think…

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.240
everyone

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.760
has different strengths.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.720
Like Robert Greene said in

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.920
The Art of Seduction,

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.200
he said that

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.000
you don’t have to be good in the same way as others.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.080
You just need to be good at being yourself.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.880
If my dad

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.920
understood even half of what you just said,

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.360
understood even half of what you just said,

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.480
Um..

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:58.960
I think I know now.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.360
Thank you so much.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.000
But I’ll excuse myself for now.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:03.520
Oh? Alright.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.000
Okay.

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:04.840
Thank you.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:05.760
Good-bye.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.560
Pas, thanks for bringing me home.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.160
I had to come set up the mic anyway.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.400
But I just found out

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.880
you live in this apartment.

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.000
Yeah, I rent here.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.120
Saint helps split the cost,

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.400
so it’s not expensive.

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.600
Oh, so you live with Saint?

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.440
Yeah.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.000
How was practice today?

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.040
Good.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.520
I got to try some new things.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:44.280
I’ll have to prepare a lot more for next time.

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:44.840
Yeah.

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.520
But if I have more ideas,

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.000
I’ll tell you right away.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.760
I’m sure one day you’ll be an amazing artist.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.680
Let me get your autograph now.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:56.160
Right here.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.640
That’ll be a long time from now.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.680
For now, I’ll just practice with the mic you gave me.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:03.480
So that I'm used to it.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.080
Alright.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.240
Give it a try.

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.480
This is my room.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.199
Wow,

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:15.719
it’s pretty big.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.159
Make yourself at home.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.120
Happy birthday to you~

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:30.000
Happy birthday to you~

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.360
Happy birthday, happy birthday~

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:43.000
Happy birthday to you~

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.840
Woo!

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.480
Wishing you lots of happiness,

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.360
wealth, great health,

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.480
and may whoever you love love you back.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.520
Happy birthday, Ice!

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.000
Wishing you lots of happiness.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.520
Make a wish!

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.920
Saint made this specially for you,

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.520
super limited edition.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:13.840
This recipe, Ice used to love it as a kid.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.600
Here, go season the pork.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:20.200
Hey.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.800
Smells good, right?

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:38.120
Yay!

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.480
Thank you so much, everyone.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.320
Happy birthday, Ice!

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:45.400
Have lots of happiness!

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.320
It’s okay, Ice.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:52.040
I’ll come set up your mic again next time.

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.800
Happy birthday.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
Have fun celebrating with your friends.

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:58.000
Pas,

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.480
stay and have cake with us first.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.360
Alright.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:12.560
Here,

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.200
try it.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.280
See if it tastes good.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.720
Sticky rice waterfall grilled pork cake.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.040
How did you even come up with this?

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.680
It tastes just like Mom’s.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.320
Actually,

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.960
your mom helped me make it.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:36:59.280
Hi.

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.040
Mom?

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.240
Happy birthday, honey.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.480
Mom…

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:08.080
I hope you’re the happiest you’ve ever been.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:16.840
Mom.

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:35.160
Here’s your birthday present.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.520
I'm sorry.

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:45.920
I rushed over so this is all I've got.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.880
The money you sent me.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.520
I never spent it.

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:01.000
I saved it all for you.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:04.520
And I’ve been saving my own money too.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.120
I thought…

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:13.840
if someday we got a chance to live together again,

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.840
you won’t have to struggle anymore.

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.720
I’m sorry that all this time

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.880
I’ve been such a useless mother.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.400
Don’t say that, Mom.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.440
I’ve been a coward.

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.920
I’ve been selfish.

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.080
I always thought that

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.880
if I could turn back time,

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.520
I would storm in and take my child back,

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.120
no matter what happened.

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.400
Live or die,

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.240
come what may.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.280
And when you called me,

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.280
I shouldn’t have pushed you away like that.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.920
It’s all in the past now, Mom.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.160
Back then we were both just doing the best we could.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.440
Your hand,

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.000
what happened to it?

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:24.640
Nothing, Mom.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.000
Don’t worry about it.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:28.120
Ice,

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.160
tell me the truth.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.840
When I was running away from the debt collectors…

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.600
I fell while running

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.600
and something cut my hand.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:50.800
Did it hurt a lot, sweetheart?

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:58.960
Not really.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.520
Everything just felt numb at that moment.

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.040
I’m sorry.

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.160
I’m so sorry.

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.040
I’m really sorry.

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.000
It’s okay, Mom.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:31.360
(Ice: Get home safely.)

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.520
(Kaew: heart sticker)

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.000
How are you?

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.600
Your mom already left?

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.000
Yeah.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.400
She had to rush back to look after the homestay.

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.120
Look.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.680
She even sent me a heart sticker.

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.160
I’m sorry for not telling you first

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.720
about inviting your mom.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.440
Thank you, Saint.

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.480
It’s the best gift I’ve ever received in my life.

00:41:58.760 --> 00:41:59.480
Yeah.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.800
Seeing you happy

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.200
makes me happy too.

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.000
Ice…

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.440
I might not be good at guitar,

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.160
and

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:34.520
I might not understand music the way you do,

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:39.080
but I want to stay by your side

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.360
and keep supporting

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.360
you like always.

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:48.680
Like always.

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.840
Actually, all this time

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:56.440
I’ve been trying to help you.

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.280
Since the mafia forced you to pay off that debt,

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:04.480
I was the one who called people to get them arrested.

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:10.360
I bought this apartment room for you.

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.120
I told Professor Sarah

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.320
to let me look after you at the university,

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.080
tried to find chances to see you,

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:22.320
joined the short film project

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:23.600
even though

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.080
I can’t act at all.

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.840
Why are you telling me all this?

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:42.960
From now on…

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.760
let me be your boyfriend.

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:51.840
I promise

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:55.520
I’ll make every one of your dreams come true.

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.040
Be my boyfriend, Ice.

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.240
No matter if my dad forbids it,

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:05.680
kicks me out,

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.040
or locks me up.

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.280
I promise,

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.800
I swear, I’ll find my way to you.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.440
I’ll protect you,

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:22.520
no matter what happens.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.440
I love you, Ice.

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:54.560
(I once went through pain.)

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:59.080
(But then you came and gathered my broken heart.)

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:02.840
(You healed the wounds that never faded.)

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:06.360
(The feeling I have when I’m with you.)

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.960
(It changed the sky that was once dark)

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.960
(into a light that made my heart beat strongly again.)

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:14.000
(Thank you for coming into my life)

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.800
(as a ray of sunshine,)

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:20.400
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:25.120
(from once withered to bloom again.)

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:29.280
(Thank you for making everyday)

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:32.240
(no longer lonely as it once was.)

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:36.160
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:41.600
(Always Red Sunflower of yours.)

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.960
Do you think Saint and Ice are together yet?

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.960
Maybe they’re secretly together…

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:56.520
like we were.

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.800
I'm just scared that…

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:01.960
even though I already broke up with Saint,

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.480
Saint’s father still wouldn’t allow him

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.000
to date Ice anyway.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.320
People…

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.600
if they really love each other,

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:16.120
no matter how hard it is,

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:17.960
you can’t stop them.

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:19.480
Believe me.

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:23.520
Sure.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:33.960
Hey guys!

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:37.320
Let’s toast!

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:38.880
Come on, come on! Bottoms up!

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:39.520
Let’s go!

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.680
Can you show me first?

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:42.400
Huh?

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.160
Show me how you do it.

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:45.040
No problem.

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:49.240
I’ve had three glasses already,

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:50.240
and I finished all of them.

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.440
But you guys haven’t finished any!

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.320
Woah!

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:54.920
Book, drink more!

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:57.240
Getting there! Mud!

00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.120
You’re drinking way too much.

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:01.160
Just a little bit!

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.240
Right, Pas?

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:02.720
Hey.

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:03.320
Right?

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.120
Who knows.

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:05.520
Do whatever you want.

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:06.400
Huh?

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.640
Okay, that’s enough. Easy stuff.

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:12.280
This is a friend from your faculty?

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.560
Ah.

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:15.280
This is my roommate.

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:15.760
Book.

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:17.600
Yep.

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:18.440
Oh.

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:20.000
Ah, nice to meet you, Book.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:20.560
Same here.

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:32.000
Are you okay?

00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:34.760
I..

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:36.120
I’m gonna go to the bathroom for a bit.

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:37.360
Oh, sure.

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.840
(Even if…)

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.600
(Even if we can’t be lovers…)

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.920
(I’ll still be your fan, Ice. From Pas.)

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:11.560
(Even if we can’t be lovers…)

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:13.160
(I’ll still be your fan, Ice. From Pas.)

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:34.360
Thank you for coming into my life

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:36.200
as a ray of sunshine,

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:41.160
that gives meaning to a sunflower like me

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:46.840
from once withered to bloom again.

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:52.240
Thank you for making everyday

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:55.400
no longer lonely as it once was.

00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:59.600
I'll give back with all the love in my heart.

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:05.120
Always Red Sunflower of yours.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:20.600
Hey!

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:24.080
What are you doing?

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.640
That tickles.

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:30.200
Day by day you’re getting clingier,

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.040
just like a little bear.

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:33.520
Please,

00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:35.800
you’re the one who’s clingy,

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.280
you little panda cub.

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:55.400
Ice…

00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:58.600
I love you.

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:03.960
I liked you ever since

00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:07.720
the first moment you stood in front of my house.

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:13.880
I liked you too

00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:18.040
ever since you gave me your shoes at the bus stop.

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.680
I love you, Saint.

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:34.840
Goodnight.

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.240
Goodnight.

00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:47.280
(Thank you for coming into my life)

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:48.760
(as a ray of sunshine,)

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:53.240
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:57.920
(from once withered to bloom again.)

00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:02.200
(Thank you for making everyday)

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.920
(no longer lonely as it once was.)

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:08.760
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:14.600
(Always Red Sunflower of yours.)

00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:22.040
(The distance from the sun to a sunflower like me.)

00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:28.400
(No matter how far, the light will always reach me.)

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:32.520
(And nobody can ever take your place)

00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:36.200
(because love has tied our hearts together.)

00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:41.480
(I promise that every second, there is only you.)

00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:43.880
(Thank you for coming into my life)

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:45.480
(as a ray of sunshine,)

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:50.000
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.720
(from once withered to bloom again.)

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:58.480
(Thank you for making everyday)

00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:00.840
Now that you're my boyfriend.

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:02.440
Is there anything else you want to do?

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:05.360
You can do anything you want now.

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.360
I'm going to hug you

00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:08.920
and tell you sweet dreams every night.

00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:10.800
When you understand what I'm trying to say?!

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.320
I...

00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:12.520
You never consider my feelings!

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:13.160
Do you know that?

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:14.120
I think we should spend some time apart

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:15.240
to think our relationship over.

00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:17.120
Ten, can I sleep over?

00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:19.120
If one day I don't let you hug me.

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:20.200
What would you do?

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:21.760
I've never thought of that day.

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.760
You don't want to hold my hand

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:24.880
because you're embarrassed of me around other people?

00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:25.920
Forget about other people.

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:28.800
I only care about my boyfriend.

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.080
Alex from freshman year.

00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:32.960
He has no record of attending any classes,

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.520
except for Professor Mint's.

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:35.680
For us to defeat

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:37.520
someone as cautious as him,

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:38.560
we must expose him

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:40.800
without giving him a chance to redeem himself.
