00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.320
Hyung,

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.630
I brought a new contract.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.550
What contract?

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.490
Our partner contract ended.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.210
We should start with a new contract.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.670
What are the conditions?

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.820
Say I love you three times a day.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.220
Once in the morning,

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.630
once in the afternoon,

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.370
and once before going to bed.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.840
And...

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:46.600
Are you cold?

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.370
A little.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.370
Give me your hand.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.520
Hyung.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.270
What is this?

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.470
Are you taking medicine?

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.980
These are painkillers.
I've been taking them since I was a kid.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.300
What are you doing?

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.370
It's cold.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.150
Haejun.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.930
I called off the engagement entirely.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.640
Then...

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.180
What about the Seoul headquarters?

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.380
A company is nothing.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.300
Nothing is more important than you.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.240
I want to spend

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.310
the rest of my life properly with you.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.159
Right from the start,

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.310
now, and in the future,
it's only you.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.430
It's only you.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.100
Then let's be together.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.080
That's a promise.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.150
The sea breeze is humid as always.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.150
Today, I brought Haejun

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.760
to my favorite beach.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.720
Looking at the tide rising and receding,
I was thinking

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.660
this world is really big

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.660
and lonely.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.040
But looking at the sea again today,

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.540
I now know I'm not alone anymore.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.810
I have someone I can hug.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.200
Haejun.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.980
The reason why fate
gave me such a long lonely path

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.280
is probably preparing me

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.340
for this moment where I walk towards you.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.770
I, Han Jaejun, promise

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.270
that I will spend

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.900
every moment and every day with you.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.830
Our story

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.670
has just begun.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.290
The sea breeze blows over my hair.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.670
This is the secret place
Hyung once mentioned.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.880
The cool beer explodes
on the tip of my tongue

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.760
A tinge of sweet smile

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.290
is hidden in the humid sea breeze.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.440
When I was a kid,

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.750
I would always be sitting here alone.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.850
Hyung's voice

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.630
is low and trembling.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.880
You must've really wanted to bring

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.730
the person you fall for here, right?

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.330
I mustered up the courage to ask that.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.460
Will you

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.620
confess again in the future?

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:45.790
He didn't answer,

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.830
but his ears turned red.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.909
"That depends on my mood."

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.700
His tone was cold,
but his gaze was gentle.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:00.990
At that moment, I realized

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.210
that within this strong man

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:05.970
lives a kid

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.650
who is afraid of loneliness.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.600
That's why I made up my mind again—

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.330
Hyung,

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.260
I'll be by your side forever.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.280
No matter how time passes,

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.380
I will hold your hand

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.330
and never let go.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.920
Our story

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:28.740
has just begun.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.140
You're like an angel when you're asleep.

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:35.850
How could you wake up an angel?

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:39.059
You woke up already?

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:41.760
Gosh.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.620
Did I go too easy on you yesterday?

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.830
You shouldn't be getting up
before I do.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.310
It feels too comfortable

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.260
in your arms, so I woke up quickly.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:51.440
In my arms?

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:54.190
Ah.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.240
I'm hungry.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.340
Is there anything to eat?

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.400
Hmm...

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.800
There are bread and milk
left in the fridge.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.560
I don't want those.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.690
Can you buy me bread and coffee

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:08.950
from the cafe in front?

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:11.480
Now?

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:13.840
The wait time will be long though.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.840
I'm going to add in

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.710
another condition.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.360
Han Jaehyun,

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.520
for Kim Haejun's happiness,

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.680
has the rights to purchase bread.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.070
Wow,

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.280
that's an abuse of the terms.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:30.730
Hmm?

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.020
What's the reward then?

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.820
I'll give you a cup of coffee.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.770
What the...

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.010
Get some more sleep.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.280
You don't frown anymore
when you sleep now.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.260
Back then, it was because

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.750
you weren't in my dream.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.190
Now even my dreams are warm.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.170
In that case,

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:00.060
I'm going to change the conditions again.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:00.760
Huh?

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.410
You must smile at me every morning.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:07.830
That condition

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.480
shall be permanently effective.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.620
Gosh.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:22.120
Don't do this.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:22.780
Don't move.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:25.170
[Thank you for your love for
"Tide of Love."]

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.170
[Thank you for your love for
"Tide of Love."]

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.170
[May this passionate love vast as sea
reach you.]

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.170
[May this passionate love vast as sea
reach you.]

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.170
[May this passionate love vast as sea
reach you.]
