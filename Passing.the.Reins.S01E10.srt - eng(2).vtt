WEBVTT

00:00:10.014 --> 00:00:12.984
How's Royal Family doing?

00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:16.688
He's doing all right, thankfully.

00:00:17.388 --> 00:00:19.257
His eye is recovering well, too.

00:00:19.324 --> 00:00:20.458
Excellent.

00:00:21.426 --> 00:00:22.827
Will you aim for it?

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:26.531
This year's Arima Kinen?

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.801
Yes.

00:00:32.504 --> 00:00:35.039
Before the Arima Kinen,
we are planning to run

00:00:35.106 --> 00:00:38.209
in three major races,
including next week’s Sapporo Kinen.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.114
For Royal Family to meet
the Arima entry requirements,

00:00:43.181 --> 00:00:48.686
he needs to win
at least one of those three races.

00:00:50.255 --> 00:00:51.890
Is it reckless?

00:00:53.358 --> 00:00:56.494
As the owner, it’s only natural
to have high expectations.

00:00:58.396 --> 00:01:01.533
We will win at least one
of the remaining three races,

00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:04.202
and meet the entry requirements
for the Arima.

00:01:04.903 --> 00:01:06.104
Our horse…

00:01:07.705 --> 00:01:09.707
will be ridden by Ryujiro Saki.

00:01:09.774 --> 00:01:10.742
Which horse?

00:01:10.808 --> 00:01:12.043
Big Hope.

00:01:13.778 --> 00:01:15.547
Sired by Royal Hope.

00:01:18.416 --> 00:01:23.288
This is the only one of Hope's that I own,
approved of by President Sanno.

00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:27.192
I wanted to tell you both in person.

00:01:28.793 --> 00:01:29.961
Is that so?

00:01:30.995 --> 00:01:32.030
Thank you.

00:01:32.096 --> 00:01:36.734
It may have been in Royal Family’s
shadow in terms of attention,

00:01:37.635 --> 00:01:40.505
but it continues to grow stronger.

00:01:41.105 --> 00:01:44.609
I've always wanted to ask you.

00:01:46.744 --> 00:01:51.182
Why was Royal Hope chosen to be the sire?

00:01:51.883 --> 00:01:57.055
Hope, who's from a small farm in Hidaka,
and retired without ever winning a G1.

00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:59.090
Why did you purchase his semen?

00:02:02.227 --> 00:02:06.331
It's Royal Hope, a horse you said
you couldn't help but despise.

00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:10.702
There's only one reason
for choosing a horse,

00:02:11.502 --> 00:02:12.403
it's to win.

00:02:13.104 --> 00:02:15.707
The reason stays the same,
no matter which horse you choose.

00:02:15.773 --> 00:02:20.812
However, what they choose to inherit
differs from person to person.

00:02:23.548 --> 00:02:25.550
With President Sanno gone,

00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:28.253
I've felt really lonely.

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.394
FIRST RACE - SAPPORO KINEN

00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:44.569
Are dreams a fantasy,

00:02:45.136 --> 00:02:46.571
or something to be achieved?

00:02:46.638 --> 00:02:47.639
ROYAL FAMILY

00:02:47.705 --> 00:02:51.142
Four months left until the Arima Kinen.

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:57.815
Royal Family had fully healed
from his corneal transplant.

00:02:57.882 --> 00:03:02.387
However, in his comeback race,
the Sapporo Kinen, he finished second.

00:03:02.453 --> 00:03:05.123
The fans applauded him,

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.859
but there were no smiles
among the Royal team.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.528
Five years old, huh…

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:13.331
It's impossible for him to win this year.

00:03:13.398 --> 00:03:17.201
Meanwhile, the rival team with So Perfect…

00:03:17.268 --> 00:03:21.306
After capturing all the three-year-old
Classics without a single loss,

00:03:21.372 --> 00:03:24.909
they declared their intention
to enter the Arima Kinen,

00:03:24.976 --> 00:03:26.878
seeking to achieve an unprecedented feat.

00:03:29.247 --> 00:03:30.581
Congratulations!

00:03:30.648 --> 00:03:33.251
Just as you declared,
you've surpassed your father!

00:03:35.953 --> 00:03:37.288
I wonder why.

00:03:39.691 --> 00:03:40.858
It's disappointing.

00:03:45.563 --> 00:03:48.266
And next, The Autumn Tenno Sho.

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.971
-Ryusei. Do your best.
-Thank you.

00:03:54.038 --> 00:03:57.108
Their opponent was the champion
Rainbow Camp,

00:03:57.175 --> 00:03:59.177
owned by Yoshihiro Shiina.

00:03:59.243 --> 00:04:02.313
Let's do our best.

00:04:03.715 --> 00:04:06.451
All horses are in position.

00:04:07.118 --> 00:04:09.687
TENNO SHO (AUTUMN)

00:04:09.754 --> 00:04:11.022
And they're off!

00:04:11.522 --> 00:04:15.326
The Royal team once again
challenged the Autumn Tenno Sho,

00:04:15.393 --> 00:04:17.195
where they previously fell to rock bottom.

00:04:17.762 --> 00:04:20.732
He came close,
but once again fell short of first place.

00:04:21.265 --> 00:04:25.303
What a champion!
Rainbow Camp crosses the finish line!

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.073
With Family's current prize money,

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.676
they were unable to secure
the coveted ticket to his dream,

00:04:31.743 --> 00:04:38.416
his only remaining path to the Arima Kinen
was to win the next Japan Cup.

00:04:38.916 --> 00:04:40.885
"Royal can't win it,"

00:04:40.952 --> 00:04:43.354
the fans’ opinions
had become increasingly severe.

00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:46.891
RAINBOW CAMP

00:04:51.429 --> 00:04:52.997
I'm dreaming of the peak.

00:04:53.064 --> 00:04:55.666
I want to make our horse
the best in Japan.

00:04:58.136 --> 00:04:59.437
At the Arima Kinen.

00:05:01.472 --> 00:05:05.910
My goal is to win a G1
with a horse from this farm.

00:05:05.977 --> 00:05:07.278
My father's dream

00:05:07.345 --> 00:05:11.582
is the dream of everyone in Hidaka.

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:13.618
I have one more dream.

00:05:15.653 --> 00:05:18.389
To achieve that win with a Hidaka horse.

00:05:23.594 --> 00:05:25.930
It's the autumn G1, the Japan Cup.
Mr. Katsuura?

00:05:25.997 --> 00:05:27.131
-Yes.
-A win here…

00:05:27.198 --> 00:05:29.634
It could be a game-changer,
making the Arima Kinen a reality.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.637
Absolutely. It’s a huge race
with 500 million yen on the line.

00:05:32.703 --> 00:05:35.673
It's very important
for those targeting the Arima.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.175
WINNING CHARM

00:05:37.775 --> 00:05:39.577
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

00:05:40.745 --> 00:05:41.813
Thank you.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.652
Under the name Yoshihiro Shiina,
for three, please.

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:50.688
I don't mean to get in your way.

00:05:52.123 --> 00:05:55.460
Just know that there isn’t a single race
we can afford to lose.

00:05:55.526 --> 00:05:57.728
Please consider this as fate.

00:05:59.764 --> 00:06:03.501
It almost sounds as if you’re saying
we’re the ones who’ll lose.

00:06:05.436 --> 00:06:08.272
Our team and Royal Family,

00:06:08.873 --> 00:06:12.310
we have not given up,
not a single one of us.

00:06:12.376 --> 00:06:15.713
Some laugh and say
it's impossible for us to win.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.482
I've got it.

00:06:20.017 --> 00:06:22.720
Others try to console us,

00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:25.122
saying we did our best.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.694
But this isn’t the first time
we’ve heard those words.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.797
The path to glory is open.
Which horse, and which jockey, will it be?

00:06:32.864 --> 00:06:34.799
-Takeshi!
-Hey!

00:06:34.866 --> 00:06:37.468
-Let's watch together!
-We're going to win this!

00:06:37.535 --> 00:06:39.270
Our dream still hasn't changed.

00:06:39.804 --> 00:06:42.073
We’ll cross the finish line
before anyone else,

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:44.542
and earn our place in the Arima Kinen.

00:06:51.549 --> 00:06:53.084
I'm looking forward to it.

00:07:07.965 --> 00:07:10.568
I want to watch Family run

00:07:11.502 --> 00:07:12.603
up close today.

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:15.673
Understood.

00:07:17.975 --> 00:07:20.478
Are dreams a fantasy,

00:07:20.545 --> 00:07:22.480
or something to be achieved?

00:07:22.547 --> 00:07:24.715
They would surely say,

00:07:24.782 --> 00:07:27.184
"A dream is something you live."

00:07:27.752 --> 00:07:30.421
As you live pursuing your dreams,

00:07:30.488 --> 00:07:33.958
before you know it,
you find yourself living with them.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.162
All right. We can win this.

00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:39.397
JAPAN CUP

00:07:39.463 --> 00:07:40.865
Tokyo Racecourse, Race 12.

00:07:40.932 --> 00:07:43.768
Today's main race is
the Japan Autumn International…

00:07:43.834 --> 00:07:44.802
You can do it.

00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:46.137
The 42nd Japan Cup…

00:07:46.203 --> 00:07:48.072
He's bothered by the crowd.

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:49.540
You can do it, Family.

00:07:50.875 --> 00:07:52.777
This year, there are
three foreign contenders.

00:07:52.843 --> 00:07:54.845
From France, Number Three Brulo.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.448
Excuse me, one with kakiage, please.

00:07:57.515 --> 00:07:58.683
-Okay.
-Why now?

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:00.985
Okay, then for me…

00:08:01.052 --> 00:08:02.620
-Kitsune noodles, please.
-Okay.

00:08:02.687 --> 00:08:04.355
-Can we turn the TV on?
-Go ahead.

00:08:04.422 --> 00:08:07.291
As for Royal, he hasn't won
a single race since his comeback.

00:08:07.358 --> 00:08:10.227
Yes. His sire, Hope, also never won a G1.

00:08:10.294 --> 00:08:12.296
It does feel like
they don't have it in them.

00:08:12.363 --> 00:08:15.600
Number 18 Caban. And from Ireland…

00:08:15.666 --> 00:08:17.702
-Thank you for waiting.
-Thanks.

00:08:17.768 --> 00:08:19.236
With those three horses…

00:08:19.303 --> 00:08:22.173
That international horse,
Great Escape, is good.

00:08:23.407 --> 00:08:27.311
I didn’t realize
it was this hard for a horse,

00:08:27.378 --> 00:08:29.480
to earn the money it needs to live.

00:08:29.547 --> 00:08:31.115
Over these past five years,

00:08:31.816 --> 00:08:34.619
we’ve done all we possibly could.

00:08:34.685 --> 00:08:38.356
Number Five, Rainbow Camp,
winner of the Autumn Tenno Sho.

00:08:38.422 --> 00:08:41.892
Now, it’s up to Shohei and Family.

00:08:42.493 --> 00:08:44.662
Oh, a rider is down!

00:08:44.729 --> 00:08:47.431
Royal Family's jockey,
Shohei Nozaki, is down!

00:08:47.498 --> 00:08:48.566
Family.

00:08:48.633 --> 00:08:51.402
Royal Family, runner-up
in the previous Tenno Sho,

00:08:51.469 --> 00:08:54.205
watches for a winning chance today
as the sixth favorite.

00:08:56.674 --> 00:08:58.876
All horses are now in position.

00:09:01.746 --> 00:09:02.713
And they’re off!

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:06.817
Number Three, Brulo,
and Number Ten Court Mayel trail behind.

00:09:06.884 --> 00:09:09.153
They sweep past the grandstand.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.489
Number Five Rainbow Camp
is also trailing behind…

00:09:11.555 --> 00:09:13.057
Hey.

00:09:13.124 --> 00:09:14.392
On the inside, Number Nine…

00:09:14.458 --> 00:09:16.494
-Family!
-Go!

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.763
In second place is Number 11,
Jato Thieves.

00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:21.032
In third, racing on the outside,
is Number 17, Kaganerian.

00:09:21.098 --> 00:09:23.434
Number Two, Royal Family,
is toward the front of mid-pack.

00:09:23.501 --> 00:09:25.703
What will happen if we lose today?

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:28.806
But first, no accidents.
They need to finish it safely.

00:09:28.873 --> 00:09:31.475
In front is Great Escape, the champion
of the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe!

00:09:31.542 --> 00:09:34.412
The lead is three to four lengths ahead,
passing the second corner.

00:09:34.478 --> 00:09:36.881
In second place is Number 17, Kaganerian.

00:09:36.947 --> 00:09:39.417
In third is Number 11 Jato Thieves.
And in fourth…

00:09:39.483 --> 00:09:40.518
Shohei!

00:09:40.584 --> 00:09:42.887
In fifth is Number Four Shake Whirl.

00:09:42.953 --> 00:09:47.258
Behind them is Number 12, Siren Pocat
rounding the curve into the backstretch.

00:09:47.324 --> 00:09:51.662
One length behind, Number Two,
Royal Family, is following mid-pack.

00:09:51.729 --> 00:09:52.830
On the outside is Number 14…

00:09:52.897 --> 00:09:53.898
Family!

00:09:53.964 --> 00:09:57.535
They passed the 1,000-meter mark
in one minute and 2.2 seconds.

00:09:57.601 --> 00:10:00.071
Number Five, Rainbow Camp, is climbing up.

00:10:00.137 --> 00:10:01.972
Here he comes!

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.075
He's good…

00:10:04.141 --> 00:10:07.545
Rainbow Camp is pushing hard
on the outside and surging forward.

00:10:07.611 --> 00:10:11.415
Ryusei Sakai coming from outside,
took the leading position in a flash.

00:10:11.482 --> 00:10:13.617
He made his move early!

00:10:13.684 --> 00:10:14.719
He's so fast.

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:20.057
Here comes the third corner curve.
The champion, Rainbow Camp, is leading.

00:10:20.124 --> 00:10:23.294
What overwhelming power!
Will he be able to keep the lead?

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.497
He's six, now seven lengths ahead,
going towards the fourth corner.

00:10:26.564 --> 00:10:27.631
We'll win this.

00:10:27.698 --> 00:10:29.400
In seventh place is Number 12.

00:10:29.467 --> 00:10:31.736
-You can do it, Family.
-In eighth place, Number Two Royal Family.

00:10:31.802 --> 00:10:34.572
-Shohei!
-On the outside Number 17 Kaganerian.

00:10:34.638 --> 00:10:37.341
There are two in second place,
heading towards the fourth corner.

00:10:37.408 --> 00:10:38.743
Number Seven Ono Kaldi,

00:10:38.809 --> 00:10:41.245
and slowly coming up,
Number Four Shake Whirl.

00:10:41.312 --> 00:10:45.416
Two lengths away, Number Two,
Royal Family, turns the fourth corner…

00:10:45.483 --> 00:10:46.684
-Here!
-Go!

00:10:46.751 --> 00:10:48.252
-Go!
-Go!

00:10:49.787 --> 00:10:52.423
I became a jockey to win the Arima.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:53.491
Go!

00:10:54.058 --> 00:10:56.227
Shohei! Please!

00:10:56.293 --> 00:10:57.495
A five length lead.

00:10:57.561 --> 00:11:00.231
All the horses are after him.
500 meters remaining.

00:11:00.297 --> 00:11:01.966
They tackle the rise!

00:11:02.032 --> 00:11:05.903
In third is Number Nine, Great Escape,
followed by Shake Whirl.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.739
On the inside, Number 11,
Jato Thieves is battling for fourth.

00:11:10.841 --> 00:11:14.879
And here he comes! From the center
with a white helmet, Royal Family!

00:11:14.945 --> 00:11:18.082
Number Two, Royal Family, moves up!
Rainbow Camp…

00:11:18.149 --> 00:11:19.984
-Hang on!
-Hang on!

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:21.118
Go! Shohei!

00:11:21.185 --> 00:11:22.586
Okay!

00:11:22.653 --> 00:11:24.855
Ono Kaldi holds the lead
past the 200m mark.

00:11:24.922 --> 00:11:26.357
Royal Family breaks from the pack…

00:11:26.423 --> 00:11:27.258
Hang on!

00:11:27.324 --> 00:11:28.225
Hang on!

00:11:28.292 --> 00:11:30.094
-Okay! Go!
-Go!

00:11:30.161 --> 00:11:32.963
Will he overtake Ono Kaldi? He did it!

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:36.967
Royal Family is in the lead!
Royal Family, ridden by Shohei Nozaki!

00:11:37.034 --> 00:11:40.738
The comeback King,
Royal Family, is widening his lead.

00:11:47.011 --> 00:11:48.579
So cool!

00:11:50.014 --> 00:11:51.582
Royal Family is in the lead!

00:11:51.649 --> 00:11:54.552
Royal Family crosses the finish line!

00:11:54.618 --> 00:11:55.519
-All right!
-Okay!

00:11:55.586 --> 00:11:57.888
-Yes!
-The winner of the Japan Cup crown is…

00:11:57.955 --> 00:11:59.590
Not the one from Hokuryo Farm,

00:11:59.657 --> 00:12:04.595
or from overseas either,
it's Royal Family and Shohei Nozaki!

00:12:04.662 --> 00:12:06.864
It's the star of Hidaka!

00:12:06.931 --> 00:12:08.999
-He made it!
-Overcoming countless injuries…

00:12:09.066 --> 00:12:12.036
They conquered the Japan Cup!

00:12:12.603 --> 00:12:14.805
-Family!
-It hasn't been an easy road.

00:12:14.872 --> 00:12:16.240
We did it!

00:12:16.307 --> 00:12:19.710
They now shine brilliantly
at the very top of the G1 Japan Cup!

00:12:19.777 --> 00:12:20.978
Koichi!

00:12:26.183 --> 00:12:27.451
Shohei!

00:12:31.922 --> 00:12:33.958
Shohei!

00:12:35.059 --> 00:12:36.393
Shohei!

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.128
You're so cool!

00:12:38.896 --> 00:12:39.864
Mr. Hironaka.

00:12:40.764 --> 00:12:42.099
Mr. Kurisu.

00:12:42.166 --> 00:12:43.567
-Shohei!
-Congratulations.

00:12:43.634 --> 00:12:44.835
-I'm so glad.
-We did it!

00:12:45.502 --> 00:12:47.671
-Thank you. You did great.
-Thank you, too.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.541
Family.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:54.345
Hanako.

00:12:54.945 --> 00:12:56.180
Did you cry?

00:12:56.247 --> 00:12:57.681
No, I didn't. Did you?

00:12:57.748 --> 00:12:59.450
-I didn't.
-Right…

00:13:11.095 --> 00:13:12.496
-Koichi.
-Yes?

00:13:12.563 --> 00:13:13.998
We finally won a G1.

00:13:14.798 --> 00:13:16.066
But, we're not done.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.335
This is only a checkpoint.

00:13:18.402 --> 00:13:21.238
We can only say we’ve truly won
when we win the Arima Kinen.

00:13:21.305 --> 00:13:22.439
Just as you said.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.642
Hey.

00:13:24.708 --> 00:13:27.378
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.383
-You're so cool!
-Mr. Kurisu.

00:13:32.449 --> 00:13:33.450
Okay.

00:13:34.718 --> 00:13:36.086
It was delicious.

00:13:36.153 --> 00:13:38.355
The fan votes for
the Arima Kinen have begun.

00:13:38.422 --> 00:13:40.324
The Triple Crown horse, So Perfect.

00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:42.393
Autumn Tenno Sho winner, Rainbow Camp.

00:13:42.459 --> 00:13:43.127
And…

00:13:43.193 --> 00:13:48.565
Royal Family can now enter the vote thanks
to their winnings from the Japan Cup.

00:13:50.834 --> 00:13:51.969
Okay, everyone!

00:13:52.036 --> 00:13:54.638
Please face this way!

00:13:55.773 --> 00:13:59.009
We’ve finally made it
to the starting line.

00:13:59.076 --> 00:13:59.910
Owner!

00:14:01.145 --> 00:14:02.646
Please smile!

00:14:04.815 --> 00:14:05.783
Mr. Kurisu!

00:14:05.849 --> 00:14:07.618
-Yes?
-Your tie is crooked.

00:14:07.685 --> 00:14:10.020
-What?
-It's crooked!

00:14:10.087 --> 00:14:13.123
-Oh, I didn't know!
-I know nothing about them.

00:14:15.693 --> 00:14:17.328
You did it, partner.

00:14:20.497 --> 00:14:23.801
Thank you very much for all the support
you’ve given me up to this point.

00:14:24.601 --> 00:14:26.804
I didn’t really do anything to help.

00:14:28.172 --> 00:14:33.344
For the next race, the Arima Kinen,
could you come to Nakayama to watch?

00:14:36.513 --> 00:14:38.215
You heard him, Mom.

00:14:39.016 --> 00:14:40.684
Thank you, that’s very kind of you.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.421
Madam.

00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:47.124
Please come to the racetrack once more.

00:14:47.191 --> 00:14:48.592
Please.

00:14:49.226 --> 00:14:50.761
I wonder if this is the first time

00:14:50.828 --> 00:14:53.731
you’ve ever stepped over
the threshold of this house.

00:14:55.032 --> 00:14:55.966
Yes.

00:14:57.534 --> 00:14:59.470
It's peaceful, right?

00:14:59.536 --> 00:15:01.805
This house used to be a place
where I could never relax,

00:15:02.473 --> 00:15:04.241
because of a certain someone.

00:15:06.877 --> 00:15:08.245
Mr. Kurisu.

00:15:08.312 --> 00:15:12.750
Have you forgotten what it is that I hate?

00:15:14.251 --> 00:15:17.388
I'm well aware, but, Madam…

00:15:17.454 --> 00:15:19.790
Must be tough for both of you.

00:15:20.457 --> 00:15:24.161
If you had lost,
perhaps you could have given up.

00:15:26.897 --> 00:15:29.099
Sorry you came
all the way here for nothing.

00:15:29.166 --> 00:15:30.267
No, it's okay.

00:15:31.568 --> 00:15:35.339
I’m truly grateful that you’ve carried
on my father's dream.

00:15:36.507 --> 00:15:37.641
Thank you.

00:15:45.716 --> 00:15:47.651
LAUREL R.C SHO
THE 13TH NAKAYAMA HIMBA STAKES

00:15:55.826 --> 00:15:58.262
-Was that really okay?
-What?

00:15:59.196 --> 00:16:00.464
Not to tell her.

00:16:01.465 --> 00:16:03.400
About what comes after the Arima Kinen.

00:16:04.034 --> 00:16:05.035
Right…

00:16:05.903 --> 00:16:08.305
I felt it would be a bit underhanded.

00:16:09.873 --> 00:16:13.310
"After the Arima Kinen,
Family will retire,

00:16:13.377 --> 00:16:15.145
so please come."

00:16:16.046 --> 00:16:19.516
If I said that,
I'd feel like I'm forcing her to come.

00:16:20.517 --> 00:16:25.089
But someday, we need to tell the team.

00:16:31.895 --> 00:16:33.697
Are you really sure about this?

00:16:35.833 --> 00:16:37.201
Yes.

00:16:37.267 --> 00:16:39.736
Family has earned enough prize money

00:16:39.803 --> 00:16:42.072
to live comfortably
for the rest of his life.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.575
No need to be injured or fight.

00:16:47.611 --> 00:16:52.316
And I know,
that now, Family is at his peak.

00:16:54.518 --> 00:16:56.286
All that's left is to win the Arima.

00:17:00.023 --> 00:17:01.024
Yes.

00:17:08.198 --> 00:17:09.433
Seriously?

00:17:10.267 --> 00:17:11.435
What is it?

00:17:12.603 --> 00:17:15.439
-Let me borrow your hand.
-Okay.

00:17:17.341 --> 00:17:18.342
No. This…

00:17:18.408 --> 00:17:20.644
-I'll leave it to you.
-What?

00:17:24.047 --> 00:17:25.282
Hello?

00:17:27.117 --> 00:17:29.153
Koichi left to go to the restroom.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.554
Yes.

00:17:31.889 --> 00:17:33.090
Tonight?

00:17:34.424 --> 00:17:39.163
To celebrate you winning
the Japan Cup, cheers!

00:17:39.229 --> 00:17:40.397
Cheers!

00:17:40.464 --> 00:17:41.598
Congratulations.

00:17:45.335 --> 00:17:47.738
Just take whatever you like.

00:17:47.804 --> 00:17:48.906
I see.

00:17:48.972 --> 00:17:53.777
It really felt good,
watching the unshakable Rainbow Camp

00:17:53.844 --> 00:17:55.379
flailing around.

00:17:55.445 --> 00:17:57.347
Serves them right.

00:17:58.682 --> 00:18:00.918
By the way, Family…

00:18:00.984 --> 00:18:02.753
He sinks when he's at his best.

00:18:02.819 --> 00:18:03.720
Sinks?

00:18:03.787 --> 00:18:05.756
-As expected, you pay attention.
-Is that true?

00:18:05.822 --> 00:18:07.891
-What do you mean "he sinks"?
-I think so too.

00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:10.961
It's because he has a flexible body.
He becomes elongated.

00:18:11.528 --> 00:18:15.632
When he's at his best,
he bends his body as if he's sinking.

00:18:15.699 --> 00:18:18.402
I think that is the secret
to his strength.

00:18:18.468 --> 00:18:22.239
On the other hand,
I realized why So Perfect wins.

00:18:22.306 --> 00:18:23.740
-What?
-The owner has good eyes.

00:18:23.807 --> 00:18:24.875
Pleasantries!

00:18:25.442 --> 00:18:27.978
Thanks to Family,
we got a lot more to talk about.

00:18:28.045 --> 00:18:30.948
The media is really hyping it up
from all sides.

00:18:31.014 --> 00:18:34.484
"Who will win, the father or his child?"

00:18:34.551 --> 00:18:37.087
"What will be the ending
of the story of the owner

00:18:37.154 --> 00:18:41.091
who couldn’t fulfill his dream,
and the child who carries that dream?"

00:18:41.158 --> 00:18:43.260
Hokuryo vs Hidaka.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.762
It's so interesting.

00:18:47.564 --> 00:18:48.599
Hey, do you remember?

00:18:48.665 --> 00:18:52.369
When you told me at the sale
that So Perfect is a good horse.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:53.937
Yeah.

00:18:54.004 --> 00:18:56.573
You're the only one who said that.

00:18:57.107 --> 00:19:00.444
The people around us had absolutely
no expectations for So Perfect,

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:02.879
whose body was still underdeveloped.

00:19:03.981 --> 00:19:05.916
But now, everyone…

00:19:10.754 --> 00:19:13.457
I discovered a new bloodline

00:19:13.523 --> 00:19:16.226
and shattered everything
people thought they knew.

00:19:17.294 --> 00:19:18.962
I created a new era.

00:19:22.633 --> 00:19:23.767
You resemble him.

00:19:23.834 --> 00:19:25.402
-What?
-Your father.

00:19:26.903 --> 00:19:28.405
That's absurd.

00:19:28.472 --> 00:19:33.076
Even if we were similar,
I'm the one who's delivering results.

00:19:33.143 --> 00:19:34.711
Having to rely on a horse
like Rainbow Camp,

00:19:34.778 --> 00:19:40.217
strong, but with no real charm,
that’s the limit of what he can do.

00:19:41.018 --> 00:19:42.486
You certainly have a lot to say.

00:19:42.552 --> 00:19:43.320
Yes.

00:19:44.221 --> 00:19:46.189
I hate him, after all.

00:19:46.823 --> 00:19:48.458
Do you remember?

00:19:49.092 --> 00:19:54.798
The race where Royal Hope and Valshare
faced off in the Make Debut.

00:19:54.865 --> 00:19:56.733
-I was watching from inside the grounds.
-What?

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.835
No kidding! Me too.

00:19:58.902 --> 00:20:00.003
-What? You too?
-What?

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:02.639
-What, you were there, too?
-Yes, I was.

00:20:03.307 --> 00:20:05.742
-It must be fate.
-Shut up.

00:20:06.443 --> 00:20:07.277
So…

00:20:08.078 --> 00:20:11.615
I was cheering for Royal Hope.

00:20:11.682 --> 00:20:14.084
The reason why I hate my father is simple.

00:20:14.151 --> 00:20:18.088
Someone who pours everything
into horses and ignores their family…

00:20:18.155 --> 00:20:18.989
He's a piece of shit.

00:20:19.756 --> 00:20:22.359
Is it really something you’re supposed
to pour your whole life into?

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.262
That debut race,

00:20:25.929 --> 00:20:29.066
Valshare was raised with a huge amount
of money poured into him,

00:20:29.132 --> 00:20:32.235
and yet the unregarded Royal Hope
challenged him, and won.

00:20:32.769 --> 00:20:34.338
It was amazing.

00:20:35.772 --> 00:20:37.841
I thought, "Serves him right."

00:20:38.642 --> 00:20:40.644
After the race, I went to see him.

00:20:40.711 --> 00:20:42.646
-He wins by an overwhelming margin!
-And then…

00:20:42.713 --> 00:20:43.914
All right!

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.115
Nobuyuki.

00:20:45.182 --> 00:20:47.050
This is what horse racing is.

00:20:48.452 --> 00:20:50.554
It keeps throwing challenges in my face.

00:20:51.121 --> 00:20:53.290
It's still not good.
It's still not enough.

00:20:53.857 --> 00:20:55.625
Even with a flawless pedigree,

00:20:55.692 --> 00:20:58.395
perfect preparations,
and an excellent jockey,

00:20:58.462 --> 00:21:01.698
no matter how certain you are of victory,

00:21:01.765 --> 00:21:04.234
you can still have your legs
swept out from under you.

00:21:05.035 --> 00:21:08.572
Horse racing is my life itself.

00:21:11.975 --> 00:21:13.877
Talk about old-fashioned.

00:21:14.745 --> 00:21:16.313
It's seriously lame.

00:21:21.918 --> 00:21:23.420
That's why I won't lose.

00:21:24.788 --> 00:21:28.325
I'll make sure to win without losing,
not even one time.

00:21:30.427 --> 00:21:33.397
You don’t want to lose to someone
who’s drunk on their own tragedy, right?

00:21:34.631 --> 00:21:35.599
You too, Koichi.

00:21:36.333 --> 00:21:40.070
Inheritance…
You'll end up becoming a slave to it.

00:21:40.704 --> 00:21:43.306
"Inheritance" sounds impressive.

00:21:43.373 --> 00:21:45.675
In the end,
it’s just carrying over a debt.

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:49.679
We're not living to clean up
after our parents.

00:21:51.148 --> 00:21:54.451
Royal, Hope, Family.

00:21:54.518 --> 00:21:56.686
They are all just chains.

00:21:56.753 --> 00:21:58.722
Be free, Koichi.

00:21:58.789 --> 00:22:02.192
The Arima Kinen will be our fight.

00:22:10.901 --> 00:22:14.805
I look forward
to your support until the very end.

00:22:15.539 --> 00:22:16.940
I see.

00:22:18.141 --> 00:22:20.444
Well, nothing about
what I have to do is going to change.

00:22:21.178 --> 00:22:24.648
I also look forward to your support.

00:22:24.714 --> 00:22:26.116
Thank you.

00:22:26.683 --> 00:22:29.786
If he's retiring,
what will you do after that?

00:22:29.853 --> 00:22:30.921
What?

00:22:31.521 --> 00:22:35.792
Well, Koichi is
an inheritance-only horse owner,

00:22:35.859 --> 00:22:38.595
you won't be able to stay
as his manager anymore.

00:22:38.662 --> 00:22:39.663
Yes.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:41.498
Where will you go?

00:22:43.834 --> 00:22:49.406
I will think about it
after winning the Arima.

00:22:49.473 --> 00:22:50.407
I see.

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:02.085
Where will I go…

00:23:05.789 --> 00:23:07.757
Where will I go?

00:23:14.764 --> 00:23:16.166
Do you have a dream?

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.268
Do you have a dream?

00:23:34.851 --> 00:23:36.386
What a nice smell.

00:23:39.289 --> 00:23:42.225
PUBLIC LOTTERY FOR STARTING ORDER

00:23:42.292 --> 00:23:44.027
Sorry, we had bad luck with the lottery.

00:23:44.094 --> 00:23:45.962
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:48.899
Gate Seven, Number 14. Sorry.

00:23:48.965 --> 00:23:49.833
No, it's okay.

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:53.937
Most predictions
have So Perfect as the favorite,

00:23:54.004 --> 00:23:56.006
with Rainbow Camp as the main challenger.

00:23:56.506 --> 00:23:59.109
As expected,
we need to look out for these two, right?

00:23:59.175 --> 00:24:00.710
Yes, we should.

00:24:00.777 --> 00:24:02.879
In last year’s Arima Kinen,

00:24:02.946 --> 00:24:05.081
Rainbow Camp conserved
its strength in the second pack,

00:24:05.148 --> 00:24:07.350
then broke away from the third corner
and won by a wide margin.

00:24:07.417 --> 00:24:11.187
With its wealth of experience,
its overall ability is still the best.

00:24:11.254 --> 00:24:13.390
But this year, aside from them…

00:24:13.456 --> 00:24:15.992
The strong finisher, So Perfect.

00:24:16.059 --> 00:24:18.428
-That's right.
-He's a real monster.

00:24:18.495 --> 00:24:20.397
He can move
to the front from any position.

00:24:20.463 --> 00:24:22.599
That kind of explosive power
is something else.

00:24:22.666 --> 00:24:24.534
Tactics don’t work on this horse.

00:24:24.601 --> 00:24:27.971
But if you let him run freely,
he becomes unstoppable.

00:24:28.538 --> 00:24:31.174
Most likely, So Perfect will come
from behind and make a late charge.

00:24:31.241 --> 00:24:33.810
I plan to position myself
behind Rainbow Camp

00:24:33.877 --> 00:24:35.979
but ahead of So Perfect.

00:24:36.046 --> 00:24:38.515
I hope they take each other down.

00:24:38.582 --> 00:24:40.584
I still have one concern.

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:45.088
Gate One, Number One.
The front-runner, Big Hope.

00:24:46.423 --> 00:24:49.359
What’s scary about Ryujiro
is that he manages to pull into

00:24:49.426 --> 00:24:50.727
this exact position.

00:24:50.794 --> 00:24:54.331
Pairing the front-runner
Big Hope with Ryujiro,

00:24:54.898 --> 00:24:57.667
as expected from President Shiina.

00:24:58.401 --> 00:25:00.737
If he has inherited Hope’s temperament,

00:25:00.804 --> 00:25:04.007
then Ryujiro’s skill will matter
even more, won't it?

00:25:04.074 --> 00:25:08.078
And on top of that, the first gate.
It’s ideal for trying to lead all the way.

00:25:08.144 --> 00:25:12.182
But in a long race like the Arima Kinen,
there’s no way he can last until the end.

00:25:13.249 --> 00:25:16.152
Be careful not to get impatient
and chase after them.

00:25:16.219 --> 00:25:17.087
Okay.

00:25:17.153 --> 00:25:18.221
ROYAL FAMILY

00:25:21.491 --> 00:25:23.293
So it's finally happening.

00:25:26.429 --> 00:25:28.932
ROYAL FAMILY

00:25:30.967 --> 00:25:33.970
If we’re going to shut down
both So Perfect’s final burst

00:25:34.037 --> 00:25:35.438
and Rainbow Camp’s persistence,

00:25:35.505 --> 00:25:38.742
then Family will have to create
a tough pace himself.

00:25:39.609 --> 00:25:41.745
The timing of the move will be crucial,

00:25:41.811 --> 00:25:43.480
so give a signal
that Family can understand.

00:25:43.546 --> 00:25:44.214
Okay.

00:25:48.585 --> 00:25:50.086
Okay, you can slow down.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.455
You paced down a little early.

00:25:52.522 --> 00:25:55.025
Let's keep the speed a little longer,
or else we won't win.

00:25:57.861 --> 00:25:58.862
A toast.

00:26:01.297 --> 00:26:02.332
Koichi!

00:26:02.399 --> 00:26:03.500
Could you propose a toast?

00:26:03.566 --> 00:26:04.768
No, not me.

00:26:04.834 --> 00:26:06.136
How about you Mr. Hironaka?

00:26:06.202 --> 00:26:08.438
No. I'm not good at it.

00:26:08.505 --> 00:26:10.807
Okay. I'll do it.

00:26:10.874 --> 00:26:12.909
-Good work, everyone!
-Oh, good!

00:26:12.976 --> 00:26:13.910
Thank you.

00:26:13.977 --> 00:26:17.747
Today is our kick-off party.
So, let's toast!

00:26:17.814 --> 00:26:19.382
Cheers!

00:26:19.449 --> 00:26:21.418
-Thank you!
-Cheers!

00:26:21.484 --> 00:26:23.086
-Cheers.
-Excuse me.

00:26:23.153 --> 00:26:24.154
There's a spy here.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.055
What?

00:26:25.121 --> 00:26:27.791
Mr. Kurisu said you
would be sad if I didn't come.

00:26:27.857 --> 00:26:29.392
Did I ever say that?

00:26:29.459 --> 00:26:31.061
-You did!
-For today…

00:26:31.127 --> 00:26:35.365
Today, we are the Royal family,
which includes Ryujiro's family, too.

00:26:35.432 --> 00:26:37.767
But in the real race,
it’s going to be a total beatdown.

00:26:37.834 --> 00:26:40.503
Bring it on! I will not lose!

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:42.605
It's okay. They actually get along well.

00:26:42.672 --> 00:26:44.140
Let's eat.

00:26:44.674 --> 00:26:47.544
If I could, I would want
to keep running with all of you,

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:50.880
next year, the year after that,
and for many, many years to come.

00:26:54.851 --> 00:26:56.920
I don’t want to feel lonely,
so starting tomorrow,

00:26:56.986 --> 00:26:59.489
let's throw ourselves into work
with everything we've got!

00:26:59.556 --> 00:27:00.590
-Yes!
-Okay!

00:27:00.657 --> 00:27:02.726
Let's win this. Win this…

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.061
and achieve our dream.

00:27:05.729 --> 00:27:06.563
We'll win this.

00:27:06.629 --> 00:27:08.031
-We will.
-Of course.

00:27:09.933 --> 00:27:12.001
Please watch, President.

00:27:15.371 --> 00:27:17.440
-Mom, juice.
-No, you can't!

00:27:22.011 --> 00:27:22.846
Excuse me.

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:24.848
Um…

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:28.651
I'll say this again.

00:27:30.653 --> 00:27:32.222
After this year's Arima,

00:27:34.057 --> 00:27:35.558
Family will retire.

00:27:36.593 --> 00:27:40.463
He was injured many times,
he even had eye surgery.

00:27:41.464 --> 00:27:43.133
He truly did his best.

00:27:43.199 --> 00:27:45.635
-Yes.
-He did his best.

00:27:46.202 --> 00:27:47.203
Everyone.

00:27:49.139 --> 00:27:52.575
Thank you so much,
for earning enough prize money

00:27:53.143 --> 00:27:57.046
for Family to walk his own path in life.

00:27:57.113 --> 00:27:58.081
No.

00:27:58.615 --> 00:28:00.183
Don't mention it.

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:04.888
Please continue to take care
of Family until the very end.

00:28:06.222 --> 00:28:08.558
-Likewise.
-Of course.

00:28:19.502 --> 00:28:20.537
Shohei.

00:28:21.471 --> 00:28:22.705
You're walking home?

00:28:22.772 --> 00:28:23.773
Just to the station.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.008
How about a taxi?

00:28:25.074 --> 00:28:26.709
Let's walk, Shohei.

00:28:26.776 --> 00:28:27.911
It's cold.

00:28:28.745 --> 00:28:31.181
You're from Hidaka!

00:28:31.247 --> 00:28:32.282
We said it in unison.

00:28:34.083 --> 00:28:34.918
Fine.

00:28:36.553 --> 00:28:37.587
It's cold…

00:28:37.654 --> 00:28:39.455
Hey! You're from Hidaka!

00:28:43.159 --> 00:28:44.427
Me too.

00:28:45.328 --> 00:28:48.198
-What is this? You're both heavy.
-No, we're not.

00:28:48.798 --> 00:28:51.467
Hey, how about you stay
at our place tonight?

00:28:52.135 --> 00:28:55.038
-I didn't bring any underwear.
-You can borrow mine.

00:28:58.975 --> 00:29:00.643
If you do that, he'll bite you.

00:29:01.244 --> 00:29:02.245
Don't bite me.

00:29:02.312 --> 00:29:04.514
Family. Don't.

00:29:04.581 --> 00:29:06.482
Stop. Family.

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:21.731
ROYAL HAPPINESS, ROYAL FIGHT,
ROYAL IZANA, ROYAL LAUGH

00:29:21.798 --> 00:29:23.433
Fight!

00:29:23.499 --> 00:29:25.068
Fight!

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:28.605
-Go!
-Go!

00:29:30.206 --> 00:29:31.574
Run!

00:29:31.641 --> 00:29:33.176
Run! Izana!

00:29:33.243 --> 00:29:35.178
Run!

00:29:36.012 --> 00:29:37.413
We did it! President!

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.815
It's just one win!

00:29:38.882 --> 00:29:40.917
We're aiming to win a G1!

00:29:40.984 --> 00:29:43.353
ROYAL IZANA, ROYAL LAUGH,
ROYAL SKY, ROYAL CANNON, ROYAL HOPE

00:29:43.419 --> 00:29:45.288
Go!

00:29:45.355 --> 00:29:47.523
Royal Hope is in the lead!

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:49.626
Royal Happiness.

00:29:51.194 --> 00:29:52.195
Go!

00:29:52.262 --> 00:29:53.897
Hope!

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:09.112
SANNO'S FAMILY GRAVE

00:30:13.516 --> 00:30:17.620
When Family retires,
my part here will also be done.

00:30:18.221 --> 00:30:21.157
Thank you for everything over the years.

00:30:31.034 --> 00:30:32.268
I talked…

00:30:34.704 --> 00:30:36.372
to my wife, Kanako.

00:30:37.607 --> 00:30:39.309
After I quit being a manager,

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:42.111
I’m thinking of working at the farm.

00:30:43.546 --> 00:30:45.014
I would like to work in a job

00:30:45.081 --> 00:30:47.717
where I can continue watching over
horses until the very end.

00:30:49.352 --> 00:30:50.720
"Until the very end"?

00:30:52.288 --> 00:30:53.990
A retirement farm.

00:30:57.327 --> 00:30:59.896
It’s a farm where they take in
retired racehorses

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:03.366
and let them live out
their lives in peace.

00:31:05.635 --> 00:31:08.604
For the horses who won,
and for the ones who didn't.

00:31:09.839 --> 00:31:14.610
My new dream is to build the best farm
where every horse can live out

00:31:16.713 --> 00:31:18.915
its life peacefully and with equal care.

00:31:52.015 --> 00:31:56.119
This is how dreams continue, huh?

00:32:04.227 --> 00:32:06.229
How about you? What's your plan?

00:32:06.796 --> 00:32:07.864
Well…

00:32:09.065 --> 00:32:11.034
It's still a blank canvas for now,

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:16.339
but I hope I’ll find the right path.

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.442
You can choose whatever you like.

00:32:20.143 --> 00:32:21.377
I see.

00:32:28.418 --> 00:32:29.886
My dream, huh?

00:32:50.807 --> 00:32:53.176
-It's finally happening.
-Yes.

00:32:53.242 --> 00:32:55.244
Oh, I heard.

00:32:57.513 --> 00:33:00.550
I'll transfer to Kansai this spring.
I'll be commuting to Ritto.

00:33:00.616 --> 00:33:02.485
It will be lonely without you here.

00:33:02.552 --> 00:33:05.288
What are you talking about?
You're quitting, too, right?

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:09.659
My "Inheritance"…

00:33:11.394 --> 00:33:12.562
The last article.

00:33:13.296 --> 00:33:15.665
I want to close it out
by writing about you.

00:33:15.731 --> 00:33:16.732
What?

00:33:18.067 --> 00:33:20.470
The final piece
on the President’s Arima victory

00:33:20.536 --> 00:33:22.238
never fell into place,

00:33:24.373 --> 00:33:26.976
but there is no better way

00:33:27.043 --> 00:33:31.414
to express the beauty of horse racing
than by telling your story.

00:33:33.149 --> 00:33:34.450
You're exaggerating.

00:33:34.517 --> 00:33:35.685
No.

00:33:36.652 --> 00:33:40.590
From the start of the race to the end,

00:33:42.125 --> 00:33:44.293
its two minutes and thirty seconds.

00:33:45.962 --> 00:33:50.533
Win it, and bring the story
of Eiji Kurisu to a close.

00:33:52.969 --> 00:33:54.036
Okay.

00:34:04.313 --> 00:34:08.751
You, my old man, everyone.
I’ll blow past you all and win.

00:34:09.886 --> 00:34:14.056
That old, worn-out dream clinging to you,
I’ll tear it off myself.

00:34:19.328 --> 00:34:21.731
You can deny my inheritance all you want,

00:34:22.498 --> 00:34:24.667
but this dream can’t be torn off.

00:34:25.668 --> 00:34:27.036
It's not my father's dream,

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:29.338
it's mine.

00:34:31.474 --> 00:34:35.077
Inheritance isn’t something forced on you.

00:34:35.711 --> 00:34:37.613
It’s something you choose for yourself.

00:34:39.282 --> 00:34:44.153
There are as many forms of inheritance
as there are people who receive it.

00:34:44.987 --> 00:34:48.858
I chose to take on the dream,

00:34:48.925 --> 00:34:50.893
and I made it my own.

00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:56.632
It would be uncool if you lose this.

00:35:00.436 --> 00:35:01.804
We'll win.

00:35:03.105 --> 00:35:04.874
We'll definitely win.

00:35:04.941 --> 00:35:06.309
The Arima Kinen.

00:35:09.478 --> 00:35:11.080
-Shohei, good luck.
-Thank you.

00:35:15.084 --> 00:35:16.919
-I look forward to today.
-How are you?

00:35:16.986 --> 00:35:19.021
-I'm good.
-That's good.

00:35:19.088 --> 00:35:20.890
So Perfect looks good, too.

00:35:23.259 --> 00:35:24.293
Hello.

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.761
-Hello.
-How are you?

00:35:25.828 --> 00:35:26.796
I'm feeling good.

00:35:26.862 --> 00:35:28.698
-Good.
-I'll do my best.

00:35:28.764 --> 00:35:30.299
-Okay.
-Thank you.

00:35:30.366 --> 00:35:32.301
-Just believe in the horse.
-Yes.

00:35:32.368 --> 00:35:33.970
-I'll do my best.
-I look forward to it.

00:35:34.036 --> 00:35:35.271
Thank you.

00:35:39.775 --> 00:35:41.177
-Understood.
-It finally came.

00:35:41.744 --> 00:35:42.645
How are you?

00:35:43.212 --> 00:35:44.247
I'm good.

00:35:44.814 --> 00:35:45.948
I'll go win this.

00:35:46.015 --> 00:35:48.351
-Looking forward to it.
-Leave it to me.

00:35:50.653 --> 00:35:52.221
We're counting on you, Shohei.

00:35:54.123 --> 00:35:59.328
Actually, I don’t think I’ve ever truly
brought out Family’s full power.

00:35:59.395 --> 00:36:00.763
-What?
-What?

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:02.064
What did you just say?

00:36:02.131 --> 00:36:05.501
So, can I do it today?

00:36:06.836 --> 00:36:07.737
You heard him.

00:36:07.803 --> 00:36:09.672
-Of course.
-Go, do it.

00:36:09.739 --> 00:36:11.907
He says he has never gone all out…

00:36:11.974 --> 00:36:13.876
What happens if he does?

00:36:13.943 --> 00:36:16.245
I don't know, but I know he can.

00:36:16.312 --> 00:36:17.213
I know he will.

00:36:18.581 --> 00:36:21.617
So we'll get to see it?
The best version of Family.

00:36:21.684 --> 00:36:24.220
You will. I'll see to it that you will.

00:36:25.121 --> 00:36:27.256
Stop!

00:36:30.293 --> 00:36:31.527
Let's go.

00:36:44.774 --> 00:36:46.876
-Family.
-Family.

00:36:46.942 --> 00:36:49.945
-You're so cool, Family.
-Family.

00:36:50.012 --> 00:36:53.249
You look so cool today, Family!

00:36:53.316 --> 00:36:56.852
Run a lot today,
and eat a lot later, okay?

00:36:56.919 --> 00:36:58.621
-You need to do it like this.
-Yes.

00:36:58.688 --> 00:37:00.056
You're great.

00:37:03.959 --> 00:37:04.894
I just felt it

00:37:06.395 --> 00:37:07.797
from the bottom of my heart,

00:37:09.598 --> 00:37:11.434
that we'll definitely win.

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:16.405
Some efforts
only mean something if you win.

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:19.508
If I can,

00:37:21.177 --> 00:37:24.313
I want to honor all the time
up until this point.

00:37:33.723 --> 00:37:36.792
Family. Do your best.

00:37:39.495 --> 00:37:43.366
Together, let's win and be rewarded.

00:37:48.471 --> 00:37:49.739
Family.

00:37:52.808 --> 00:37:54.910
Thank you for getting me here.

00:37:55.711 --> 00:37:56.812
Go, Family.

00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.882
Family, shall we go?

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:08.524
Okay.

00:38:08.591 --> 00:38:10.092
The Royal family?

00:38:11.127 --> 00:38:13.796
Okay. Thank you.

00:38:21.437 --> 00:38:23.372
You must be in shock.

00:38:24.106 --> 00:38:26.275
I heard that you're retiring.

00:38:26.342 --> 00:38:28.511
I heard from Mr. Kurisu.

00:38:29.245 --> 00:38:32.515
How was life as a horse owner? Was it fun?

00:38:35.017 --> 00:38:36.786
It has been nothing but hardships.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.323
I’ve always felt like I was carrying
so much on my shoulders.

00:38:43.826 --> 00:38:46.095
But if we win, it will all be worth it.

00:38:50.366 --> 00:38:52.201
He's saying the same thing as Sanno.

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:05.247
Nakayama Racecourse, Race 11,
today’s main event is the Arima Kinen!

00:39:05.314 --> 00:39:08.317
Everyone has brought us all the way here.

00:39:08.384 --> 00:39:11.020
The horses will be coming out shortly.

00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:21.263
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

00:39:37.179 --> 00:39:41.450
Gathered at the starting gates of
the Nakayama 2,500-meter turf course

00:39:41.517 --> 00:39:44.286
are 16 star horses,
all chosen by fan vote.

00:39:44.353 --> 00:39:46.755
The horses are loading into the gate
in an orderly manner.

00:39:46.822 --> 00:39:49.291
Number Nine Rainbow Camp
is going to the gate.

00:39:49.358 --> 00:39:51.093
How will Sakai make his move?

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:52.761
In his previous Tenno Sho run,

00:39:52.828 --> 00:39:55.664
he posted an incredible time
of one minute 50 seconds.

00:39:55.731 --> 00:39:59.101
-Big Hope has drawn the ideal position…
-All right.

00:39:59.168 --> 00:40:01.570
Many see him as the leading front-runner.

00:40:01.637 --> 00:40:04.473
Coming from the G2 Stayers Stakes
and the Nihonkai Stakes…

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:06.108
Let's go, Hope.

00:40:06.175 --> 00:40:07.476
All right.

00:40:07.543 --> 00:40:09.812
Big Hope, has now moved into the gate.

00:40:09.879 --> 00:40:14.083
Now, the even-numbered horses.
The favorite, Number Two, So Perfect.

00:40:14.149 --> 00:40:17.119
A revolutionary closer, we’ll see
from where he makes his move today.

00:40:17.186 --> 00:40:18.454
Let's go!

00:40:18.521 --> 00:40:21.724
Winner of the Japan Cup
and having announced their retirement,

00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:24.627
Number 14 Royal Family enters the gate.

00:40:24.693 --> 00:40:25.895
I'm not letting you get away.

00:40:27.129 --> 00:40:28.264
We'll win this.

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:29.565
God.

00:40:30.666 --> 00:40:32.268
I give all of my luck.

00:40:32.334 --> 00:40:34.203
They are all gathered at Nakayama.

00:40:34.937 --> 00:40:37.506
There's a beautiful sunset
over the racecourse.

00:40:37.573 --> 00:40:41.610
Number Four, Isle No Seldar
is being led into their gate.

00:40:41.677 --> 00:40:42.778
They are in position.

00:40:42.845 --> 00:40:45.247
Shohei, don't panic.

00:40:45.848 --> 00:40:48.250
All horses are now in position.

00:40:48.317 --> 00:40:50.819
Now, it's time.

00:40:53.923 --> 00:40:56.191
The Arima Kinen has started.

00:40:56.258 --> 00:40:58.928
Front-runner Big Hope starts late.

00:40:58.994 --> 00:40:59.828
No way!

00:40:59.895 --> 00:41:01.931
-Ryujiro.
-Number 16 Squeeze Aries.

00:41:01.997 --> 00:41:05.568
From the inside, Number Four,
Isle No Seldar pushes forward.

00:41:05.634 --> 00:41:07.636
Calm down! We'll win this!

00:41:07.703 --> 00:41:09.171
He's lost it.

00:41:09.238 --> 00:41:11.040
This is where the jockey’s skill
truly gets tested.

00:41:11.106 --> 00:41:14.743
Number 11 Hermy.
On the outside, Number 14 Royal Family.

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:16.211
That's a good position.

00:41:16.278 --> 00:41:17.846
Number Two, So Perfect,
sits on the inside.

00:41:17.913 --> 00:41:20.983
The Arima's course is long, don't panic.

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:24.520
Midfield comes Number 12 Wine Allison,
followed by all-rounder

00:41:24.587 --> 00:41:28.724
Number Nine Rainbow Camp who has
settled toward the rear of the midfield.

00:41:28.791 --> 00:41:30.593
They have entered the fourth corner.

00:41:30.659 --> 00:41:33.228
Under the evening sun,
they come before the grandstand.

00:41:33.295 --> 00:41:34.496
He made his move.

00:41:34.563 --> 00:41:37.900
Number Nine Rainbow Camp is moving
effortlessly up into third, then second!

00:41:37.967 --> 00:41:39.602
He keeps rising and has taken the lead!

00:41:40.169 --> 00:41:44.239
Roaring cheers rise from the grandstand
as Number Nine Rainbow Camp leads…

00:41:44.306 --> 00:41:45.274
Isn't his pace fast?

00:41:45.341 --> 00:41:47.376
He’s pulling.
It's a turf with 2,500 meters, you know?

00:41:47.443 --> 00:41:49.712
Not yet, Shohei. Don't panic.

00:41:49.778 --> 00:41:53.115
-Don't panic.
-Squeeze Aries in the first corner.

00:41:53.182 --> 00:41:57.853
Ryusei Sakai pushes into a fast tempo,
with 59.4 for the first 1,000 meters.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.357
Number Four Isle No Seldar, and Number 16
Squeeze Aries are starting to drop back.

00:42:01.423 --> 00:42:02.992
Number 14 Royal Family,

00:42:03.058 --> 00:42:06.095
and Number Two So Perfect,
are moving up into second and third.

00:42:06.161 --> 00:42:07.696
That’s some impressive acceleration.

00:42:07.763 --> 00:42:09.298
Number 11, Hermy is on the outside.

00:42:09.365 --> 00:42:11.700
Family. Go.

00:42:12.267 --> 00:42:14.103
They're at the final 1,000 meters.

00:42:14.169 --> 00:42:16.238
Number One Big Hope is at the very back.

00:42:16.305 --> 00:42:18.140
They pass the 800-meter mark,
into the third corner.

00:42:18.207 --> 00:42:19.642
Rainbow Camp still holds the lead.

00:42:19.708 --> 00:42:22.211
Pace down!

00:42:22.277 --> 00:42:25.114
Running in close formation
with Wine Allison.

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:28.717
The champion, Camp is tough! Number Five,
Xenverse sits fifth from last.

00:42:28.784 --> 00:42:30.519
Veepland is fourth from last.

00:42:30.586 --> 00:42:32.187
It's almost time…

00:42:32.254 --> 00:42:34.223
Number Eight, V-Hook and Number Three…

00:42:34.289 --> 00:42:35.991
-He made his move!
-Here it comes!

00:42:36.058 --> 00:42:39.561
Number Two So Perfect makes his move!
So Perfect is accelerating rapidly!

00:42:40.629 --> 00:42:42.931
Number 14 Royal Family is also moving up!

00:42:42.998 --> 00:42:45.901
Number Nine Rainbow Camp
is getting swallowed up by the pack!

00:42:45.968 --> 00:42:48.270
So Perfect takes the lead!
He’s making a bid for it!

00:42:48.337 --> 00:42:49.238
Number 14, Royal Family…

00:42:49.304 --> 00:42:50.773
-Shohei!
-Keep up!

00:42:50.839 --> 00:42:53.442
Royal Family is biting at his heels!

00:42:59.148 --> 00:43:00.149
He's sinking…

00:43:00.215 --> 00:43:01.350
Family!

00:43:01.417 --> 00:43:03.485
No, not yet!

00:43:03.552 --> 00:43:06.388
So Perfect holds firm!
He leads by a length.

00:43:06.455 --> 00:43:08.357
-Perfect! Let's go!
-Here he comes!

00:43:08.424 --> 00:43:09.692
He can still speed up?

00:43:09.758 --> 00:43:11.694
You’ve got more in you.

00:43:12.561 --> 00:43:13.729
Family!

00:43:13.796 --> 00:43:16.231
Into the straight!
Into the short Nakayama straight!

00:43:16.298 --> 00:43:19.134
It’s a battle for the lead between
So Perfect and Royal Family!

00:43:19.702 --> 00:43:21.737
-Family!
-Go!

00:43:21.804 --> 00:43:22.805
Shohei!

00:43:22.871 --> 00:43:25.240
So Perfect or Royal Family?
They are alone in the lead!

00:43:25.307 --> 00:43:28.711
So Perfect or Royal Family?
They hit the incline!

00:43:29.411 --> 00:43:31.980
Neither is giving an inch!

00:43:32.047 --> 00:43:32.915
They’re neck and neck.

00:43:32.981 --> 00:43:34.183
Go! So Perfect!

00:43:34.249 --> 00:43:35.250
Go!

00:43:35.317 --> 00:43:36.218
Hang on!

00:43:36.285 --> 00:43:37.786
Go!

00:43:37.853 --> 00:43:39.088
Who will take the lead?

00:43:39.154 --> 00:43:41.590
It's Royal Family!
Royal Family is in the lead!

00:43:41.657 --> 00:43:44.660
200 meters to go! Here comes a challenger!

00:43:49.465 --> 00:43:50.899
The real battle starts now!

00:43:56.105 --> 00:43:57.906
Run, Family!

00:43:57.973 --> 00:43:58.907
Run!

00:43:58.974 --> 00:44:01.577
Surging from the outside! He's closing in!

00:44:01.643 --> 00:44:04.913
Look at that stretch!
He has left fifth and fourth place behind!

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:08.183
The White Bullet, Big Hope!
He's come out of nowhere!

00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:09.551
He’s into third!

00:44:09.618 --> 00:44:10.719
Go!

00:44:11.286 --> 00:44:12.354
Go past him!

00:44:12.921 --> 00:44:14.590
Hope!

00:44:14.656 --> 00:44:16.225
Hope!

00:44:17.059 --> 00:44:19.928
I'm still immature, you see.

00:44:23.532 --> 00:44:26.602
Do you want to create
the best horse with me?

00:44:26.668 --> 00:44:27.536
LIGHTNING NEO

00:44:27.603 --> 00:44:30.072
I want to purchase Hope’s semen.

00:44:32.107 --> 00:44:33.642
When the real fight comes,

00:44:33.709 --> 00:44:37.913
you and I will be the wall
that stops the young ones.

00:44:40.015 --> 00:44:41.984
You sure are greedy.

00:44:44.253 --> 00:44:46.622
That "real fight" you're talking about…

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:50.058
It's the Arima, right?

00:44:50.759 --> 00:44:51.860
Of course.

00:44:51.927 --> 00:44:55.831
I promise that Hope's foal
will win the Arima.

00:45:06.475 --> 00:45:07.709
I'm on board.

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:19.087
BIG HOPE

00:45:20.355 --> 00:45:23.625
Big Hope chases the leads!
Keep running Royal Family!

00:45:23.692 --> 00:45:25.127
Hope!

00:45:25.194 --> 00:45:26.962
So Perfect falls back! Royal Family leads!

00:45:27.029 --> 00:45:27.863
President…

00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:29.731
-Big Hope won't stop! He’s surging!
-Hope…

00:45:43.178 --> 00:45:45.480
-Go Family!
-Go!

00:45:46.048 --> 00:45:49.418
He catches So Perfect!
Is it Family? Or Hope?

00:45:52.054 --> 00:45:53.255
BIG HOPE

00:45:56.291 --> 00:45:58.093
-President…
-Family!

00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.595
Your horses…

00:46:00.162 --> 00:46:03.465
They are locked together!
The brothers are side-by-side!

00:46:03.532 --> 00:46:04.533
Ryujiro! Do your best!

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.001
Family!

00:46:06.068 --> 00:46:07.636
Your children.

00:46:07.703 --> 00:46:08.704
Hope!

00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:09.571
They're here…

00:46:12.674 --> 00:46:14.543
Hope!

00:46:17.613 --> 00:46:19.848
They cross together!

00:46:19.915 --> 00:46:24.086
Royal Family and Big Hope
cross the line neck and neck.

00:46:24.152 --> 00:46:25.621
Is it Hope or is it Family?

00:46:25.687 --> 00:46:29.191
Big Hope's strong finish was amazing!

00:46:29.258 --> 00:46:30.726
We don't know the result of this one!

00:46:30.792 --> 00:46:36.365
The Photo Finish sign is flashing!
The 70th Grand Prix, Arima Kinen.

00:46:36.431 --> 00:46:38.800
First and second place
will be decided through photo.

00:46:42.204 --> 00:46:45.941
Nakayama Racecourse, Race 11.

00:46:46.008 --> 00:46:48.277
First and second place.

00:46:51.079 --> 00:46:52.915
The first place is Number One.

00:46:53.582 --> 00:46:56.618
The second place is Number 14.

00:47:00.789 --> 00:47:03.959
A Hidaka horse won the Arima!

00:47:04.026 --> 00:47:05.093
Takeshi!

00:47:05.727 --> 00:47:07.696
It's the Arima!

00:47:07.763 --> 00:47:11.733
Hope's stallions placed first and second!

00:47:29.484 --> 00:47:32.888
I also made him a promise.

00:47:38.293 --> 00:47:39.895
To win the Arima,

00:47:40.963 --> 00:47:43.365
with the President's horse.

00:48:02.117 --> 00:48:04.152
-Congratulations.
-Thank you very much.

00:48:07.856 --> 00:48:09.124
Thank you very much.

00:48:11.026 --> 00:48:14.363
It's the strong horse
that Owner Sanno left behind.

00:48:15.897 --> 00:48:18.100
Royal Hope, who was born in Hidaka,

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:23.005
and the horse from Hokuryo
chosen by Owner Shiina…

00:48:27.576 --> 00:48:29.244
President.

00:48:31.046 --> 00:48:32.781
You won the Arima, after all.

00:48:32.848 --> 00:48:35.484
Hidaka or Hokuryo,
in the end, it makes no difference.

00:48:37.119 --> 00:48:41.590
The two owners joined forces
for the sake of victory.

00:48:42.157 --> 00:48:45.093
No, it was the two fathers
who joined forces.

00:48:45.761 --> 00:48:46.995
They got us.

00:48:59.608 --> 00:49:00.809
Koichi.

00:49:00.876 --> 00:49:02.310
Damn it.

00:49:14.856 --> 00:49:16.591
Unbelievable!

00:49:16.658 --> 00:49:19.494
And on top of that,
the jockey is Ryujiro Saki!

00:49:22.164 --> 00:49:25.434
At last, I've fulfilled my promise.

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:26.635
Thank you.

00:49:31.206 --> 00:49:33.108
Damn it!

00:49:34.743 --> 00:49:35.911
It's no good.

00:49:36.845 --> 00:49:39.681
My old man has such a nasty personality.

00:49:40.248 --> 00:49:43.251
Let’s go to see Ryujiro.

00:49:43.318 --> 00:49:44.920
-Thank you.
-Mr. Aiso.

00:49:49.424 --> 00:49:51.860
Let's plan for next year.

00:49:53.695 --> 00:49:54.963
I will be in your care.

00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:58.033
We didn't win again this time.

00:49:59.201 --> 00:50:03.338
With this, all the horses
I've rooted for have lost.

00:50:05.474 --> 00:50:09.010
I probably will never come
to the racetrack again.

00:50:09.077 --> 00:50:11.113
You were rooting for him?

00:50:12.214 --> 00:50:13.215
Madam.

00:50:16.751 --> 00:50:20.655
This is where your true life begins.

00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:24.993
I know that he wishes it for you, too.

00:50:25.527 --> 00:50:27.996
Thank you for coming today.

00:50:28.797 --> 00:50:31.233
Let’s have a good,
long talk over the New Year.

00:50:32.567 --> 00:50:34.202
Not a serious talk.

00:50:35.704 --> 00:50:38.006
I want to talk about trivial things,

00:50:38.573 --> 00:50:39.774
because you're family.

00:50:46.982 --> 00:50:49.918
What do you like?

00:50:52.053 --> 00:50:53.355
Curry.

00:50:55.991 --> 00:50:58.059
ROYAL FAMILY

00:51:03.832 --> 00:51:04.900
Look at that.

00:51:06.902 --> 00:51:08.803
That's the first time
I've seen Family like that.

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:16.578
You're right.

00:51:30.025 --> 00:51:32.627
I've always wanted to throw away my ego.

00:51:33.728 --> 00:51:38.567
Stop projecting my own dreams
and feelings,

00:51:39.334 --> 00:51:41.036
and focus only on the horse.

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:43.605
That's why I wanted to retire.

00:51:46.675 --> 00:51:47.876
But…

00:51:51.012 --> 00:51:53.181
sometimes it's the other way around.

00:51:55.016 --> 00:51:57.919
"What if Family still wants to run?"

00:51:57.986 --> 00:51:59.487
Is that what you are thinking?

00:52:02.991 --> 00:52:05.093
If I retire him now,

00:52:07.629 --> 00:52:09.764
that would be my ego as well, right?

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:13.702
Koichi.

00:52:15.036 --> 00:52:16.304
Are you hesitating?

00:52:16.905 --> 00:52:17.772
What?

00:52:17.839 --> 00:52:20.709
About retiring,
thinking it may be too early.

00:52:21.309 --> 00:52:22.444
Oh, no.

00:52:23.445 --> 00:52:25.981
I've already announced it.

00:52:28.917 --> 00:52:34.556
It would be embarrassing
to withdraw my retirement.

00:52:39.794 --> 00:52:41.096
Hypothetically,

00:52:42.397 --> 00:52:44.733
if you were to take back
your retirement now,

00:52:45.267 --> 00:52:47.435
it would take a lot of determination.

00:52:48.637 --> 00:52:51.806
You may face criticism.

00:52:53.842 --> 00:52:55.110
I don't care about that.

00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:57.078
It's just…

00:52:58.480 --> 00:52:59.848
I just…

00:53:02.217 --> 00:53:06.688
Then, let's let the horse decide.

00:53:07.989 --> 00:53:09.057
Family.

00:53:11.993 --> 00:53:14.095
If Family says so,
then it can’t be helped.

00:53:15.597 --> 00:53:16.865
In any case,

00:53:16.931 --> 00:53:23.371
I will do my utmost,
for you and for Family.

00:53:28.576 --> 00:53:29.577
So…

00:53:30.145 --> 00:53:31.546
Let's go see Family.

00:53:33.915 --> 00:53:35.016
Mr. Kurisu.

00:53:36.418 --> 00:53:37.352
Yes?

00:53:50.165 --> 00:53:51.399
Don't you ever…

00:53:53.034 --> 00:53:54.736
betray me.

00:54:01.476 --> 00:54:02.777
Ever.

00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:08.750
Understood.

00:54:22.263 --> 00:54:25.266
Looking back now, I have to say
that your decision at that time

00:54:25.333 --> 00:54:27.369
turned out to be the right one.

00:54:27.435 --> 00:54:28.536
No.

00:54:28.603 --> 00:54:30.038
Thank you very much.

00:54:30.872 --> 00:54:33.775
Now then, up to this point,

00:54:33.842 --> 00:54:36.444
we looked back from the time
of the previous owner

00:54:36.511 --> 00:54:37.779
to Family’s first retirement.

00:54:37.846 --> 00:54:40.682
Now, I would like to ask
about your outlook for the future.

00:54:40.749 --> 00:54:44.486
Now that you have officially acquired
your horse owner’s license,

00:54:44.552 --> 00:54:45.687
what are your thoughts?

00:54:46.321 --> 00:54:47.989
I feel anxious.

00:54:49.791 --> 00:54:52.093
Are you going to do it alone this time?

00:54:53.928 --> 00:54:55.964
That's my intention, for now.

00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:57.031
But…

00:54:57.899 --> 00:55:00.402
there's someone
I really want to tell about this.

00:55:03.004 --> 00:55:04.339
I’m going to see them now.

00:55:06.307 --> 00:55:07.675
Give him my regards.

00:55:09.711 --> 00:55:10.945
I will.

00:55:11.513 --> 00:55:13.748
Is there someone
who hasn't received it yet?

00:55:14.315 --> 00:55:15.417
Okay.

00:55:15.483 --> 00:55:16.684
Here you go.

00:55:16.751 --> 00:55:18.119
You're welcome.

00:55:18.186 --> 00:55:20.488
This white horse

00:55:20.555 --> 00:55:22.357
is Royal Izana.

00:55:23.124 --> 00:55:24.659
She's cute, right?

00:55:24.726 --> 00:55:30.098
You do it like this,
slowly feed them, okay?

00:55:30.165 --> 00:55:33.935
This one is Royal Hope.

00:55:34.002 --> 00:55:35.637
He sometimes bites.

00:55:35.703 --> 00:55:38.106
Be careful, okay?

00:55:38.173 --> 00:55:40.141
Try feeding them, slowly.

00:55:41.042 --> 00:55:42.510
No, like this.

00:55:42.577 --> 00:55:43.778
He ate it!

00:55:44.345 --> 00:55:45.547
Everyone, look.

00:55:45.613 --> 00:55:49.384
This one is Royal Fight.

00:55:49.451 --> 00:55:53.955
He and that white horse Izana
are very close.

00:55:54.022 --> 00:55:56.157
"I want to eat, too…" Try feeding him.

00:55:56.224 --> 00:55:57.659
Yes, just like that.

00:55:57.725 --> 00:56:00.829
Good for you, Fight.

00:56:00.895 --> 00:56:02.497
ROYAL HOPE

00:56:06.401 --> 00:56:08.770
What time are you leaving Haneda?

00:56:09.504 --> 00:56:10.805
Okay.

00:56:10.872 --> 00:56:13.842
It's really cold here, be careful.

00:56:20.315 --> 00:56:21.249
Family!

00:56:21.316 --> 00:56:23.284
-Family!
-Family!

00:56:23.351 --> 00:56:25.954
The horses are in position.
The Osaka Hai. And they're off!

00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:28.623
Royal Family takes the lead right away!

00:56:29.123 --> 00:56:30.758
What a finishing speed!

00:56:30.825 --> 00:56:34.195
Following the Osaka Hai,
he has now conquered the Spring Tenno Sho!

00:56:34.963 --> 00:56:38.066
At long last, the title goes to Japan!
A truly "Royal" victory!

00:56:38.132 --> 00:56:40.301
The dream of a nation
has just become reality!

00:56:40.368 --> 00:56:44.372
Japan's Royal Family
wins the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe!

00:56:44.439 --> 00:56:46.741
ROYAL FAMILY

00:56:46.808 --> 00:56:51.379
It’s 2026, and the fans have packed
the Nakayama Racecourse once again.

00:56:51.446 --> 00:56:54.516
Race 11, the 71st Arima Kinen.

00:56:54.582 --> 00:56:56.150
All the attention is on the gates.

00:56:56.217 --> 00:57:00.488
Which horse will make history?
The 71st Grand Prix Arima Kinen!

00:57:00.989 --> 00:57:02.790
They're off! He messes up!

00:57:02.857 --> 00:57:05.894
Number 11, Royal Family, starts late!

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:09.631
Royal Family's final race
begins from the very back!

00:57:09.697 --> 00:57:11.900
The crowd is in shock!

00:57:11.966 --> 00:57:13.601
But the race has only just begun!

00:57:13.668 --> 00:57:18.973
This track has six corners,
two hills, and a grueling 2,500 meters.

00:57:19.507 --> 00:57:21.142
Will he get revenge?

00:57:21.209 --> 00:57:24.312
Last year's runner-up, Royal Family,
pushes up to midfield.

00:57:24.379 --> 00:57:27.382
Nozaki is holding him steady,
whispering "Don't panic."

00:57:27.448 --> 00:57:29.918
He retracted his retirement
for this moment!

00:57:29.984 --> 00:57:32.954
He returns this year as the fan favorite!

00:57:33.021 --> 00:57:35.156
The heartbreak of an Arima
must be healed at an Arima!

00:57:35.223 --> 00:57:37.058
Rounding the fourth corner!
Into the final straight!

00:57:37.125 --> 00:57:38.560
It's still anyone's race!

00:57:38.626 --> 00:57:41.229
From the outside it's Number 11,
Royal Family!

00:57:41.296 --> 00:57:45.199
He passes four horses in a flash!
This is it! Remember this moment!

00:57:45.266 --> 00:57:47.268
This is Royal Family!

00:57:47.335 --> 00:57:50.038
He is strong! A glorious finale!

00:57:50.104 --> 00:57:53.041
The pride of Hidaka, Royal Family!

00:57:53.107 --> 00:57:54.242
Family!

00:57:57.111 --> 00:57:58.880
All right!

00:58:00.949 --> 00:58:03.484
We did it!

00:58:06.754 --> 00:58:08.323
Family!

00:58:13.995 --> 00:58:15.029
Eiji!

00:58:15.897 --> 00:58:18.132
Koichi will arrive
at the airport at 6 p.m.

00:58:18.199 --> 00:58:22.203
Right… Let's eat Genghis Khan for dinner.

00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:23.171
What?

00:58:23.237 --> 00:58:24.405
Again?

00:58:24.472 --> 00:58:26.841
You surely don't get tired of it.

00:58:26.908 --> 00:58:30.178
Why not? It's a hundred times
better than what you get in Tokyo.

00:58:30.745 --> 00:58:31.579
Okay.

00:58:31.646 --> 00:58:37.385
2026 ARIMA KINEN

00:58:37.452 --> 00:58:38.720
Let's go.

00:58:38.786 --> 00:58:40.622
