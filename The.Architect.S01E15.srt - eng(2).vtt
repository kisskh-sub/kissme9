(What do I have to do)

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.675
(for you to choose me?)

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:19.000
Come on.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.240
Let me give you a kiss.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.380
The wedding banquet is over.

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:30.879
Why are you still here?

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.319
You have your reasons.

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:35.759
I have my plans.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.879
Different paths but same destination,
hence we're bound to meet.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.639
Go.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.759
Light the incense for me.

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:50.639
Yes, My Lord.

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:54.560
I missed you so much.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.599
Beauty.

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:57.479
My Lord.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.599
Wait for me.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.840
I'm coming.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.719
My Lord.

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:03.520
Come on.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.680
Xiao Huaijin lives in luxury
and indulgence every day.

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:11.800
However, Prince Duan

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.319
seems almost too clean and simple.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.919
There must be more to it.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.159
This setup

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.479
doesn't match his status at all.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.599
He must've arranged it on purpose

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:27.800
as a disguise

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.199
to hide something

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:30.439
more important.

00:03:39.862 --> 00:03:42.212
(Ledger)

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.400
Found it.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.919
This is the proof that Prince Duan
smuggled contraband and iron ore.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.000
Finally, I found it.

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.319
You can't leave now.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.960
If you do,

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.360
you're walking right into his trap.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.120
It's better to wait until they're done.

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:27.000
I want it too, My Lord.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.780
It's the aphrodisiac incense.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.990
We were too focused on finding evidence

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:09.240
and had inhaled it by accident.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.519
Come out.

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:26.240
My Lord,

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:28.920
I was serving Xiao

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.040
with all my heart,

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.639
yet

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.560
this man abducted me.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.120
Abducted you?

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.420
More like you two have been
seeing each other

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:40.480
behind my son's back.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.560
Please calm down, My Lord.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:42.460
I'm innocent, My Lord.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.390
If we were truly having an affair,

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.720
why would we choose this place?

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.920
Governor Pei,

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:53.700
it's late at night,
yet you broke into my private chamber.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.160
And the two of you dressed like this.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.800
Don't you think

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.319
you owe me an explanation?

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.639
Explanation?

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:05.360
I came to the banquet today

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.680
because I wanted to take back
my concubine.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.720
Your son actually dared
to steal my woman.

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.600
I didn't strike him down at the banquet

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.350
because I still have respect
for the Prince Duan's Residence.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.879
You!

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.360
Do you want to refuse that courtesy?

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.720
You have a death wish.

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:26.639
Why?

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.319
Want to fight?

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:35.120
And you.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.800
You betray me.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.800
Do you know the consequence?

00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:43.120
Pei Yu,

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.680
this is Prince Duan's Residence.

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:48.160
No matter how arrogant you are,

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:49.519
what can you possibly do?

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:51.079
Right.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.000
Pei Yu,

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:53.519
a word to the wise.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.160
Surrender now.

00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:56.600
Come to the palace with me

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.880
and seek His Majesty's audience.

00:06:58.439 --> 00:06:59.279
Otherwise,

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:01.480
don't blame me

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.639
for being cruel.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.639
Prince Duan,

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.199
do you intend

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.839
to fight me to the death?

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.120
And what of it?

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:11.600
In today's matter,

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:13.959
no matter how favored you are,

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.920
I'm in the right.

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:25.319
If we bring this to His Majesty,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.920
are you not afraid for your own life?

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:30.519
What are you getting at?

00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:40.879
Let him go.

00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:41.800
Yes, My Lord.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:03.480
I'll bring the horse here.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.079
I tore out the most important pages

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.959
to get the evidence out safely.

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:14.360
They're hidden on you.

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:16.319
Please return them to me.

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:19.040
Why do you always push me away?

00:08:22.959 --> 00:08:23.959
I appreciate

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.399
your concern,

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.519
but I can't accept it.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.279
Please let me go.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
What do I have to do

00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:32.559
for you to choose me?

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.460
If you won't choose me,

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.679
I'll choose you.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.240
This is your repayment for me.

00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:01.799
(Sorry, Pei Yu.)

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:02.919
(If I weren't carrying)

00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:04.840
(this revenge,)

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:06.200
(I would choose you.)

00:09:06.919 --> 00:09:08.679
(But right now,

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.440
(I must walk this path alone.)

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:28.720
(The chance for revenge
won't come twice.)

00:09:29.679 --> 00:09:31.200
(I've paid so much)

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.159
(to come this far.)

00:09:33.919 --> 00:09:35.120
(I can only move forward.)

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.360
(There's no turning back.)

00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:43.559
(Pei Yu,)

00:09:43.879 --> 00:09:46.759
(I can't afford to fail this time.)

00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:47.600
Xiao,

00:09:48.159 --> 00:09:48.919
you're awake.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:50.960
Why can't I remember anything

00:09:52.039 --> 00:09:53.840
about last night?

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.200
You must've drunk too much.

00:09:57.399 --> 00:09:58.399
You lost your memory.

00:09:59.159 --> 00:09:59.919
Really?

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:02.399
Well, it doesn't matter.

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:07.200
We can

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:09.200
try something new

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.159
today.

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:21.679
Xiao, the auspicious hour has arrived.

00:10:21.679 --> 00:10:23.200
We have to serve tea to Master.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:23.890
If we miss the hour,

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.690
I won't get the chance
to pay respect to him.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.240
I'm finally in the mood.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.320
Don't spoil it.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.799
My Lord!

00:10:35.039 --> 00:10:35.879
This is bad!

00:10:36.039 --> 00:10:37.690
Someone from the palace came
to arrest us.

00:11:01.879 --> 00:11:02.600
Pei Yu,

00:11:02.919 --> 00:11:04.159
how dare you

00:11:04.679 --> 00:11:06.679
storm into a prince's manor
with armed soldiers?

00:11:06.679 --> 00:11:08.600
Do you realize this is treason?

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.600
Guards,

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.440
beat these traitors

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.440
out of my house!

00:11:16.879 --> 00:11:17.600
Who dares?

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.559
Qilin Guards

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.440
act under His Majesty's command.

00:11:21.919 --> 00:11:23.360
Anyone who obstructs us

00:11:24.639 --> 00:11:26.320
will be killed without mercy.

00:11:31.587 --> 00:11:32.960
I never imagined the Xiao family,

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.120
poor and cautious

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.360
for generations,

00:11:35.919 --> 00:11:36.759
would be framed

00:11:37.159 --> 00:11:38.679
by a despicable scoundrel.

00:11:40.679 --> 00:11:42.159
You're still pretending.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.200
Prince Duan's Residence

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.840
has long been corrupt

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.320
and deceitful,

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:49.679
and selling iron ore to foreign regions,

00:11:49.799 --> 00:11:51.279
causing wars and unrest

00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:52.440
along the borders.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.890
If one intends to accuse,
there's no way I can defend myself.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.279
What proof do you have?

00:11:57.679 --> 00:11:58.879
I can testify.

00:12:10.799 --> 00:12:12.440
I can testify for Governor Pei.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.130
Prince Duan's Residence

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.559
has committed crimes
that endanger the nation

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.070
by engaging in treasonous dealings
that warrant clan extermination.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:19.679
You!

00:12:24.374 --> 00:12:25.534
Wench!

00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:26.519
Nonsense!

00:12:26.919 --> 00:12:29.159
The evidence is already in the palace.

00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:31.399
Blaming me won't change anything.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.279
Evidence?

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.200
What evidence?

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.240
Whatever you said

00:12:38.879 --> 00:12:40.159
was clearly forged by

00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:41.440
you and Pei Yu,

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.320
a pair of adulterers.

00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:46.600
Governor Pei,

00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:48.799
you framed a prince.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.320
That's a crime punishable
by clan extermination.

00:12:52.159 --> 00:12:53.320
If the truth comes out,

00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:54.879
not just the two of you,

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.840
even Consort Shu

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.440
will be dragged down with you.

00:12:59.799 --> 00:13:01.679
You should think carefully.

00:13:02.039 --> 00:13:04.200
You're still barking
when death is at your door.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.440
Qilin Guards,
