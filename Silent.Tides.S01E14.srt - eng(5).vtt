[Episode 14]

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.870
Here is Chairman Ma Wanqi
of Hengfengyu Bank

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.509
and

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.870
Manager He Xian,
representative of Tai Fung Bank,

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.789
which provides financial backing

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:49.870
for Hengfengyu.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.420
Chairman Ma.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.370
Mr. Rodrigues,

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.259
we clearly negotiated this deal
with you first.

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.780
Don't you think it was inappropriate
for you to suddenly arrange

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.110
a three-party meeting?

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:02.730
Well...

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.350
You're certainly
a long-standing client of mine,

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.030
but we haven't signed any contract,

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.240
nor have you made any payment.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.870
Besides,

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.669
the price we discussed earlier

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.600
was agreed upon
before the Hong Kong dollar plunged.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.400
I asked for payment in U.S. dollars,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.370
but you refused.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.130
Business in Macau has always been settled
in Hong Kong dollars.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.240
Now you suddenly demand U.S. dollars—

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.240
where am I supposed to get that much?

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.740
But the Hong Kong dollar has now fallen
too sharply.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.690
Mr. Ma,

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.910
you need to understand my position.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.250
How about this:

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.520
for the sake of
our many years of friendship,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.430
if you agree to pay 10% more

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.030
and pay in full immediately,

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.960
I'll ask Mr. Saito

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.690
and Mr. Ogata to leave right now.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.020
That should be fair enough, no?

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.020
Mr. Rodrigues...

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:51.890
I'm sorry.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.710
The amount for this shipment is
just too large,

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:55.870
and now you want to raise the price.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.300
We simply can't afford it.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.160
Moreover,

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.190
you know very well
we're currently raising funds

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.460
for this payment.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.660
If you want U.S. dollars instead,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.880
you'll have to give us some time.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.780
So that means you won't pay more,

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.690
and you won't pay immediately?

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.930
Mr. Saito, Mr. Ogata,

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:18.810
what about you?

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.530
Can you pay in U.S. dollars?

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.560
Before we finalize the payment method,

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.340
we have a small request

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.870
and wonder if you could accommodate it.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.270
Please go ahead.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.750
It's what I mentioned to you on the phone—

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.579
the purchase voucher
for this shipment of rubber.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.200
Let me clarify first—

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.680
I personally have absolute trust

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.340
in your business reputation.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.230
But the amount involved
in this transaction

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.160
is extraordinarily large.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.430
Our bank has its own rules too.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.900
I've been doing business in Macau
for so many years,

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.460
and this is the first time I've been asked
to present the purchase contract

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.990
for on-site verification.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.860
This is the purchase contract

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.460
I signed with Lee Kong Chian.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.090
Here.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.020
Verify it.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.220
Please give us a moment.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.310
Actually, there's one more guest
with us today.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.930
Mr. Qiao.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:15.720
Please have a seat.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.060
Allow me to introduce him.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.920
This is

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.920
Mr. Qiao Renyu, Chief Accountant

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.130
of HSBC Hong Kong,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.480
Mr. Qiao.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.720
Did you bring everything?

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.480
The thing is,

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.080
Lee Kong Chian

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.780
has an account at HSBC.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.400
So the bank has
his signature and seal on file.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.490
Mr. Qiao

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.220
has always handled
his financial transactions.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.450
So this time

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.420
I specifically asked him to come
and take a look.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.360
Mr. Ogata, you're certainly very cautious.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.990
I'm being cautious

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.130
to ensure better cooperation.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.380
This is the contract, Mr. Qiao.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.070
Thank you.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.830

[Lee Kong Chian]

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.490
Look.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:59.360
Mr. Lee Kong Chian

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.680
donated a large sum of money to us

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.540
and even took a photo with us.

[Lee Kong Chian]

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.450
You're not allowed to attend anymore.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.000
You don't have the guts to go yourself,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.010
but you won't let me go.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.490
You...

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:07.830
[Lee Kong Chian]

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.000
What are you doing?

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.770
[Lee Kong Chian]

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.060
What's so confidential

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.520
that we must discuss it
at Mr. He's residence

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.150
and can't tell anyone else?

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.890
The rubber tycoon Lee Kong Chian
has a rule:

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.740
only for deals
worth over 10 million dollars

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.820
will he personally sign the contract.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:29.590
Is that true?

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:30.230
Yes.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.770
Most people can't even get
a meeting with him,

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.220
let alone get him to sign contracts
for small deals.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.310
So that means

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.140
you've never signed a contract with him

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.600
and never seen his signature either?

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.630
Not just me.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.180
In all of Macau, you can count on one hand

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.490
the number of people
who've seen his signature.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.930
[Lee Kong Chian]

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.770
Why is a corner of this signature missing?

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:47.810
Yinwan said that

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.670
during an argument, her brother Qiao Renyu

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.130
accidentally damaged it.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.720
However,

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.420
it's just missing a small part at the end.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.890
It doesn't affect recognition.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:56.510
Fine.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.570
So be it if it's damaged.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:07:59.020
[Lee Kong Chian]

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.620
Just copy it exactly as it is.

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:43.730
Mr. Qiao.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.400
The signature is real.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.030
Everyone, we've been negotiating for days.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.030
Since neither of you

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.340
is willing to settle in U.S. dollars,

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.320
I'll reluctantly make a concession.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.820
Tomorrow at 6 PM.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.600
Whichever party

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.630
can pay the full amount in one go,

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.020
I'll accept Hong Kong dollars
and sign the contract with them.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:21.950
Any objections?

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.440
Payment tomorrow?

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.060
Mr. Rodrigues,

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.220
you know that right now we

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.080
-really can't…
-Alright, Mr. Ma.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:29.200
After all,

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.640
the Hong Kong dollar
has been extremely volatile

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.970
in the market recently.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.910
Who knows if there might be

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.770
another sharp drop in the future?

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.020
For me to accept Hong Kong dollars at all

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.580
is already the biggest concession
I can make.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.500
I can't be the only one
taking all the risks, can I?

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:45.670
Mr. Rodrigues,

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.840
if Hengfengyu is
really having difficulties,

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.110
then perhaps there's no need to
wait until tomorrow.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.970
We can sign the contract now.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:54.950
Wait!

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.390
Tomorrow it is.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.230
Hengfengyu agrees to the conditions.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.710
Mr. Ogata, come on!

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:11.900
Let's have a drink together!

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:12.540
Come on, come on!

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.600
Let's have a drink!

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.880
Congratulations, Agency Chief Sawa.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:18.670
Your Sawa Agency

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:21.290
really can dig up any kind of information.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.580
Cheers!

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:23.550
Cheers.

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:24.630
-Cheers.
-Come on.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:26.320
Come on, cheers.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.190
Mr. Qiao?

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:35.350
Come on, cheers.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.170
Cheers.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.940
To be honest, I've been wondering

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.450
what kind of client

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.240
could possibly take on

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.200
such a large rubber inventory.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.860
I even planned to sell it off in batches.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:52.500
I didn't expect that...

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.850
Would you like some apple pie?

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.060
You could actually secure Specie Bank

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.740
as your financial guarantor, Mr. Saito.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:58.940
I just wonder

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.180
how things will turn out tomorrow.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:03.760
This shipment of rubber

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.990
will surely be ours!

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.170
Mr. Qiao, how have things been for you

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:10.230
in Hong Kong?

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.880
Quite well, actually.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.320
It's just that sometimes...

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:37.170
I worry about my family.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.190
Hardship is inevitable
for people fleeing war.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:45.490
But fortunately,

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:47.910
those hardships are only temporary.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.500
With help from friends,

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:51.920
their lives get better and better.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.030
That's good.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.060
However,

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.330
they miss

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.930
their family day and night,

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:08.520
holding them dear in their hearts,

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.830
and praying every day

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.300
for their safety.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.620
As long as they stay strong
and keep waiting,

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.950
even with mountains and seas between them,

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.950
I believe

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.010
the day of their reunion will come.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:30.440
Good.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:32.670
To that day,

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:34.040
cheers.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.320
Cheers.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:37.540
Come on.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.620
Let me toast to you.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.620
You still

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:43.660
need to pay me quickly

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:44.750
for this shipment.

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:46.390
Mr. Rodrigues...

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:47.840
-Of course, of course.
-Mr. Qiao.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.240
Don't worry.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.570
You've had your drinks.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.670
-You should go back and rest now.
-We'll pay you on time.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:53.390
Got it.

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.350
I'm sorry, Mr. He.

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:02.860
It's fine, it's fine.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.890
Mr. Qiao!

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.440
I'll be going now.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:07.240
Mr. Qiao!

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:07.670
Alright.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:08.600
Please!

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:20.820
Let's go!

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.250
Let's go.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.360
Excuse me,

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.540
my stomach doesn't feel so good.

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.050
I need to use the restroom.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.330
Put this in the car for Mr. Qiao.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:38.410
Go ahead.

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:42.040
I'm really sorry, sir.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:42.770
I'm sorry.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.360
This isn't your fault.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.960
You might need to clean this up
in the restroom.

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:48.890
I'm so terribly sorry.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:49.510
Thank you.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:54.360
Mr. Huang.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.510
Mr. Qiao, please.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:19.070
Captain Huang,

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:20.890
is this really necessary?

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:36.020
Stop.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.340
What?

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:40.870
I can't even use the restroom?

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.690
No entry means no entry.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.030
It's not convenient right now.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:45.630
I'm really sorry.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.920
Are you even being reasonable?

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:49.340
My word is law here.

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:50.590
Mr. Huang.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:52.080
Captain Huang.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.410
Xian,

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.240
what's wrong?

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:56.320
My clothes are dirty,

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.920
and I need to go in to clean up.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.220
What's wrong with your men?

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.940
Why won't they let me use the restroom?

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.740
Mr. Qiao is using the restroom right now.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.050
He's an honored guest
of the Imperial Army.

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:07.810
Colonel Sawa has given explicit orders

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:09.940
that no one is allowed to approach him.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:11.450
It's such a big restroom.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.710
My using it for a moment won't affect him.

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:15.830
Xian,

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.600
I'm just doing my job.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.860
Please don't make this difficult for me.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.720
Fine, fine.

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:24.810
Your guest must be royalty—

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:26.590
we commoners must keep our distance.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:28.720
I'll just wait here then, is that okay?

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.420
I'm sorry, Mr. He.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.900
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:41.650
Captain Huang,

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.140
can I go in now?

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:44.940
Hold on.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:16.550
Mr. Qiao, we can go now.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:19.590
Xian, please go ahead.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.580
What's wrong, Mr. Huang?

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:39.700
I can't shake the feeling

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.630
that something's not quite right.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.600
Keep an eye on him.

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:51.370
I'll go up and check again.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:46.170
The Japanese

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.910
have forced

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:47.980
the issuance of

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.870
a new batch of 120 million HKD.

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:54.400
Once all of this new batch of money
has been spent,

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.440
the Japanese will

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.310
declare

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:57.790
the Hong Kong dollar invalid.

00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:59.350
Then, the Hong Kong dollar will become

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:00.390
worthless paper.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:34.860
Captain Huang,

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.380
why are you back again?

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.010
Captain Huang,

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:04.400
what exactly are you looking for?

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.930
What treasure did you lose?

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.480
Nothing.

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:57.000
Yu.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.010
Miss Qiao,

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:03.400
I know you're very sad.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.260
You once said

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.470
your brother was the only family
you had left.

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:11.900
He was always very good to you.

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:14.870
Now that he's in the hands of
the Japanese,

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.230
he must be suffering terribly.

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.030
Even if he really did do something wrong,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.530
it was probably just so he could
see you again.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.070
If he knew

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:31.680
that even you didn't want him
as your brother,

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:34.060
how could he still hold on?

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:02.030
You actually miss him very much,

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:02.790
don't you?

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:19.420
I know I should hate him.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:24.460
But I just can't help it.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.260
I can't help thinking about him.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.140
I can't help worrying about him.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.100
I also think about Daddy

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:44.560
and Mommy all the time.

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.260
Miss Qiao,

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:48.930
if you miss your brother,

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:50.950
just allow yourself to miss him.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.300
No one will blame you.

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:10.020
Yu.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.980
I really miss him.

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:17.220
I really miss my brother.

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:20.480
Yu, look.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.260
This is a photo of my brother and me

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.420
when we were on a ship together.

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:27.510
I was wearing

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:28.740
a little bow tie then.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.260
Can you tell which ones are us?

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:39.370
[Kiang Wu Elementary School]

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:42.420
Are you sure these are

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.310
the serial numbers of the HKD notes
that were issued under duress?

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:46.630
I've checked

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.030
the serial numbers of all newly issued
HKD banknotes

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:49.920
that appeared during this period.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.280
The serial numbers of those dollars
printed after 1937

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.910
all fall within the ranges

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:55.800
provided by Qiao Renyu.

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:58.930
Based on the denominations
and serial number ranges,

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:00.860
I've calculated the total amount—

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.760
it comes out

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:04.120
to exactly 120 million.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:08.600
Excellent.

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.220
With these specific serial numbers,

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:14.430
we can reveal the truth
about this whole matter

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.050
and call on society

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.850
to refuse to accept
or use this batch of banknotes.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:20.520
Qiao Renyu

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.180
has made a tremendous contribution

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:25.560
to China's resistance against Japan.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:32.520
And I mistook him for a traitor.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.420
No,

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:35.300
I must go apologize to her right away.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:35.920
Mr. Liang.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:36.320
Yes?

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:38.900
I also thought about going to find Yinwan

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.100
to tell her the truth.

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.850
I even made it outside her dormitory.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.010
But I still didn't do it.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.380
Why?

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.810
Once these serial numbers are published,

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.930
the Japanese will immediately know

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.880
it was Qiao Renyu who leaked them.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.280
Right, right.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.080
Right, right.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.220
Once the serial numbers are made public,

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:04.770
the Japanese will launch
a ruthless retaliation against Qiao Renyu.

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.300
When Mr. Qiao revealed these numbers,

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.430
he was fully aware of the consequences.

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:12.630
This is intelligence

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:13.700
he delivered

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.200
at the risk of his life.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:17.030
But Yinwan and Mr. Qiao

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:18.320
share a deep bond.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.590
If she were to learn the truth now,

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.270
it would be like announcing

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:24.720
her brother's death sentence
right in front of her.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.090
For her, that would be

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.980
far more cruel
than a temporary misunderstanding.

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:31.210
But for the greater cause,

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.830

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:09.920
There are still 3 million in sell orders
with no takers!

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:10.920
What should we do?

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:13.540
Find out immediately who's selling!

00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:18.100
What did you say?

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.440
Banco Nacional Ultramarino?

00:34:21.949 --> 00:34:22.830
Are you certain?

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:24.280
It's true. Not only that,

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:24.480
BNU just dumped another 3 million

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.480
[Tai Fung Bank]

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.010
and the price has already dropped
to HKD 3.10.

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:34.360
It's Banco Nacional Ultramarino,

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.360
and they've sold another 3 million?

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.889
General Manager, the selling pressure
is overwhelming.

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:41.139
Even if we urgently place buy orders,
it won't help.

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:43.580
The price has dropped to HKD 3.

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:45.280
Should we keep placing buy orders?

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:45.960
No,

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.460
suspend all actions.

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:51.300
Eight million? How is that possible?

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:53.920
Didn't we all agree last night
to follow your orders?

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:54.840
You didn't give any instructions,

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.920
so how could our BNU act on its own?

00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:58.900
You're asking me? Who should I ask then?

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.600
I just need Banco Nacional Ultramarino

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.670
to stop selling immediately

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:02.550
and withdraw their sell orders.

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:04.310
I'll go find out right away!

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:16.810
[Hong Kong Dollar; 2.98]

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.030
Just before the market closed,

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:37.100
did the bank dump 8 million HKD?

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:46.150
Did you or not?

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:49.630
Mr. Ogata,

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.780
why did the market suddenly change?

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.110
What exactly happened?

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.240
Mr. Qiao,

00:35:57.670 --> 00:36:00.770
didn't you say the Chinese merchants
would team up with BNU

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:02.540
to secure enough funds?

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.370
Why would

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.210
BNU suddenly sell such large quantities?

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:07.530
Well...

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.840
BNU's sudden selling

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:11.430
is likely intended to drive the price down

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:14.030
so Chinese merchants can buy
at a lower price later.

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:15.130
Impossible!

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:16.590
According to our calculations,

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:18.590
the Chinese merchants' funds
must have already been exhausted!

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:20.490
They have hardly anything left!

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:22.030
They can only sell first to get cash

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:23.840
before buying at lower prices.

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:24.760
And all morning,

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.840
the four major Chinese banks combined

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:29.280
have only sold less than 10 million!

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:30.690
And the cash from those sales

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:32.370
was all used to buy back!

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:34.020
So where would they get the extra money

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.950
to absorb BNU's massive sell-off?

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:37.260
We can't be absolutely certain

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.450
our calculations are correct.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.290
What if we're wrong?

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:42.700
What if the Chinese merchants

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.420
managed to raise massive funds
at the last minute?

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:45.820
All of this could happen.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.290
We calculated these figures separately,

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:51.910
right?

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:53.970
Could we both have been that far off?

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:57.600
If the Chinese merchants
had secured massive funding,

00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:58.400
would they still need to

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.330
spend the entire morning
locked in battle with us?

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:02.340
So your projection
that the Chinese merchants'

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:04.130
retreat-then-advance strategy

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:05.550
rests solely on the assumption that they

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:07.100
can borrow that 15 million from BNU!

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:08.670
Now that BNU is selling on its own,

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:10.570
it means they never lent money
to the Chinese merchants!

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:12.630
Do you really think the Chinese merchants
could double their position

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:16.360
to over 60 million with nothing but
their original 30 million base?

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:19.550
Mr. Ogata.

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.610
Banco Nacional Ultramarino's sell-off

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:24.980
has already proven one thing:

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:25.800
the HSBC treasurer

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.150
leaked the truth

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:30.710
about the Hong Kong dollar
before his death.

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:31.700
If that's true,

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:33.870
neither the Chinese merchants
nor Rodrigues

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:35.450
would trust HKD anymore.

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.430
And that rubber deal

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.680
was just a trap they set.

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:42.270
And Qiao Renyu here

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.860
is deliberately working with them...

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:49.680
to trick you.

00:37:57.610 --> 00:38:00.240
The Chinese merchants are fighting
on the front lines,

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:01.300
and the only thing we need to do

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:02.630
is wait as agreed.

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:04.000
I'll go find out right now.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.590
Once they succeed,

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:07.510
we can also withdraw safely.

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:09.770
Isn't that a win-win?

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:12.090
Why undermine them
at this critical moment?

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:13.220
If they fail,

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.460
what benefit is that to the bank?

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:19.030
Because the plan designed
by the Chinese merchants

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:20.460
is too risky.

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.560
Such a high-risk strategy—

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:24.920
one slip,

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:28.130
and it could lead to total failure.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:31.820
And the bank would go down with them.

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:33.800
So our only way out

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.030
is to take advantage
while they're fighting

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:36.420
and sell our holdings at a decent price.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:37.820
The board has calculated that

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:38.960
if we move quickly enough,

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.650
the loss would be at most 2 or 3 million.

00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:42.610
At least the bank can survive.

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:43.550
But the moment we place sell orders,

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:44.630
this game will be over.

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:48.210
The Chinese banks will be

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:50.440
completely destroyed by Specie Bank.

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:53.750
Isn't that offering them up as sacrifices?

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:55.400
Must it be this way?

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:57.000
Sorry, Rodrigues,

00:38:57.210 --> 00:39:00.500
but this is the only safe way
to save the bank.

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:02.520
And it's the board's decision.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:13.530
When you reached an agreement
with the Chinese merchants yesterday,

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.530
you had already decided to do this,

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:16.490
hadn't you?

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.810
My dear Rodrigues,

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:20.820
the board kept you in the dark

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:22.510
for the sake of the entire bank.

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:25.000
You're also an executive director
of the bank.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.190
What we're doing

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:28.340
is protecting your interests too.

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:37.450
Xian,

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:39.390
what did Rodrigues say?

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.190
He said

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:42.460
the sell-off was a decision made by

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:43.570
the board of Banco Nacional Ultramarino.

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:45.250
His single vote couldn't change it.

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:46.550
After the market opens this afternoon,

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:47.710
Banco Nacional Ultramarino

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:50.240
will immediately dump
all its remaining HKD.

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.120
We're finished.

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:53.140
What should we do?

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:53.980
We're doomed.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:54.880
Dr. Ke?

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:02.970
Mr. Ogata,

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:04.450
you don't have to believe me,

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:05.420
but if Robert

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:06.960
had really leaked the secret
about the HKD,

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.660
the first to dump
would have been the Chinese banks,

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:10.520
not Banco Nacional Ultramarino.

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.260
That's true.

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:16.400
As for why Banco Nacional Ultramarino

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.590
suddenly started selling,

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:19.730
I believe our opponent,
facing imminent defeat,

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:20.990
had to take desperate measures.

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:23.190
Their only purpose in muddying the waters

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:25.270
is to disrupt your team's morale.

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:27.750
From what I can see,

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:29.110
it seems to be working quite well.

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:30.110
You're wavering.

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.130
And that's exactly
what they're aiming for.

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:33.420
You mean

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:34.730
they're

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.610
just trying to trick me?

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.810
Trick me into giving up market support

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:40.460
and selling alongside them?

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.120
Besides that,

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:43.780
is there any better way

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.310
to drive down the HKD price?

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.040
Mr. Ogata,

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:50.170
don't let him mislead you any further.

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:51.110
This morning alone,

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:53.010
you've already purchased
nearly 10 million HKD.

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:53.840
If you continue making mistakes,

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.110
you'll only ruin
all our previous achievements.

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:57.860
You must stop supporting the market!

00:40:57.860 --> 00:40:59.410
Sell whatever you can.

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:02.190
Mr. Ogata,

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:03.410
although I believe

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:06.300
continuing to support the market
will defeat our opponents,

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:09.190
Colonel Sawa's suggestion is more prudent.

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.910
The marketplace is a battlefield—

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:12.310
no one wins every battle.

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:13.460
Losing once in a while

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:16.120
won't affect your status
as a financial genius.

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:17.300
Mr. Ogata.

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.100
Colonel Sawa!

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:23.610
I am the one in charge of this operation.

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:25.380
I am.

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.030
After the market opens this afternoon,

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:29.920
I will continue to monitor the situation.

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.500
Only if Banco Nacional Ultramarino
stops selling

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.670
and Chinese merchants start buying
in large quantities

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:36.170
will I

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.680
continue supporting the market.

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:51.490
I know you're all under a lot of pressure,

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.320
but there's no turning back now.

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:55.160
We can't pull out in the middle.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.530
The only way forward

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:57.980
is to keep

00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.080
this game going

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:00.720
and make it even bigger.

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.020
We must convince the Japanese

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:03.630
that Banco Nacional Ultramarino's
earlier sell-off

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:04.820
was just an extreme tactic
by the Chinese and Portuguese

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:06.600
to drive down the Hong Kong dollar.

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.170
But to keep this game alive,

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:10.060
we must fulfill two conditions.

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.730
First, we need

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:11.570
Banco Nacional Ultramarino

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:13.230
to stop selling.

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:13.860
Second,

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:15.380
we need to raise funds

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:18.210
to maintain the illusion
that we're still buying.

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:19.050
But right now,

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:21.250
neither of these is within our reach.

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:23.720
I actually

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:25.850
have an idea to solve both problems.

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:27.260
Dr. Ke,

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:28.830
what's your plan?

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:31.100
First, about the money.

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:32.650
Wanqi, let me ask you:

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:33.620
in all of Macau,

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.410
who has both the courage

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:37.630
and large amounts of cash

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:39.000
at their disposal?

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:41.710
You mean

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:43.060
the Tai Ho Brotherhood?

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.590
The Tai Ho Brotherhood operates
outside the law

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:48.010
with plenty of hard cash

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:48.960
that they can't deposit in banks

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:49.770
or financial institutions.

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:50.710
But only they

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:52.590
can provide large sums of money
at any time.

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:54.790
But this battle carries extreme risks.

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:56.950
Whether we can persuade Master Sanhe

00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:59.080
to stake his entire fortune to help us—

00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:00.660
that depends on you now.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:01.510
I can't guarantee

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:02.640
that I can borrow it,

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:05.060
but I'll definitely do my utmost.
