=Episode 21=
(I only seek the truth)

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.020
I have a witness.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.260
The Captain of the Garrison,

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.060
Xie Yunyan.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.500
A witness?

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.460
That is merely hearsay.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.290
Then let this so-called witness of yours

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.020
come here and speak.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.740
Since Prince Yu demands
that I come forward,

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.380
then I shall step out
and say a few words.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.260
You...

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.779
I, Xie Yunyan, Captain of the Garrison,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.660
confirm that Wen Luo's
testimony is true.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.980
This is Wen Zhihu's dying testimony.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.539
Also, the location
where Prince Yu secretly stored

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.060
contraband salt and smelted iron.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.539
I also personally witnessed

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.059
Tan Xu, Prince Yu's personal guard

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.699
murder Wen Zhihu to silence him,

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.580
and intending to frame me.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.379
I, Su Jinyuan,

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.980
am also a witness.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.211
You all...

00:02:21.212 --> 00:02:23.292
You are all in collusion!

00:02:25.987 --> 00:02:28.257
(Wen Zhihu had been helping Prince Yu smuggle salt
and smelted iron for weapons for many years.)

00:02:28.612 --> 00:02:29.419
Prince Yu,

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.139
as a member of the Imperial Family,

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.539
smuggling smelted iron,

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.819
murdering a high-ranking official,

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.720
and embezzling vast profits
from maritime transport.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.532
The crimes you have committed,
every single one warrant the death penalty.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.860
Guards!

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.380
The Emperor has arrived.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.100
Rise.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.260
Prince Yu.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.780
You truly are my worthy younger brother.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.260
Guards.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.580
Seize him.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.260
Your Majesty, wait.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.900
Your Majesty,

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.259
Prince Yu's crimes are all here.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.659
Why not hold a public trial?

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.100
You...

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.460
According to our Great Qing law,

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.700
Prince Yu should first
be imprisoned in the Imperial Prison.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.819
Once his crimes are verified,
he should be immediately executed.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.220
Xie Yunyan!

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.020
Since when is it your place
to instruct me?

00:04:00.287 --> 00:04:01.779
Back then, when Xiao family

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.300
was falsely accused of treason,

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.974
it was based solely on Feng Kui's word,

00:04:05.975 --> 00:04:07.655
yet the entire family was condemned.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.860
Today, Prince Yu's crimes
are undeniable.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.419
Why does Your Majesty speak evasively
and refuse a public trial?

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.420
Audacious!

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.060
Xie Yunyan,

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.980
I take into account that you are
the only male of the Xiao family,

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.220
and I will not pursue
this matter further this time.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.580
If there is a next time,

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.780
I will show no mercy.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.140
Your Majesty.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.811
Prince Yu colluded with Nanyue,

00:04:49.812 --> 00:04:51.652
allowing the Nanyue army
to breach the pass,

00:04:52.462 --> 00:04:54.182
leading to the fall of Linchuan

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.780
and the death of tens
of thousands of Xiao family army,

00:04:56.912 --> 00:04:59.632
yet he framed the Xiao family
for colluding with the enemy.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.859
I have here

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.580
a secret letter written
by Prince Yu to my father.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.179
You are lying!

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.100
When did I ever collude
with an enemy state?

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.820
Your Majesty,

00:05:12.337 --> 00:05:13.457
I didn't.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.300
I truly didn't!

00:05:29.075 --> 00:05:30.179
(I've secretly agreed
with Nanyue to allow their army)

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.532
(to breach the pass and seize Linchuan
when the time comes.)

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.820
Your Majesty.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.380
I have my own plan.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.020
Come with me.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.139
Prince Yu.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.140
Give me back my father
and brothers' lives!

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.900
Yan!

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.620
Xie Yunyan!

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.260
How dare you commit murder
right in front of me.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.860
Your Majesty,

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.619
my father and brothers
were loyal heroes,

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.900
yet they died at the hands
of this vile villain.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.700
As a son,

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.500
I must seek justice.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.580
If Your Majesty refuses
to right this injustice,

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.100
then I will risk my own life

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.699
to send him to hell!

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.740
Xie Yunyan!

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.699
Your Majesty,

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.979
all the Xiao family seeks

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.859
is the truth
that brings peace to the living

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.780
and repose to the dead.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.580
What is Your Majesty truly afraid of?

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.459
Your Majesty,

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.699
I know you cherish your fraternal bond,

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.740
but Prince Yu's guilt is irrefutable.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.460
Take Prince Yu

00:07:11.312 --> 00:07:13.112
to the Imperial Prison.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.860
Once the evidence is verified,

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.700
execute him immediately.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.100
Your Majesty!

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.619
Your Majesty, I've been framed!

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.660
Your Majesty!

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.019
You've ruined me!

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.220
You are the ones who ruined me!

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:32.980
Your Majesty!

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.980
I've been wronged!

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.140
You ruined me!

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.300
Prince Yu certainly deserved to die,

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.232
but Young Master Xie,

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.340
do not let your hatred
be exploited by others.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.140
Young Master Wen,

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.700
your father clearly told me
before he died

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.760
that in the battle of Linchuan,

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.420
Prince Yu did not intend
to destroy the Xiao family.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.300
Where exactly did you obtain

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.940
that secret letter?

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.100
I...

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.000
If the court proceedings
take an unexpected turn,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.260
present this secret letter

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.179
and speak as I instructed you.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.257
Prince Yu

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.700
will surely die.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.340
But...

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.020
This is false evidence.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.499
If you want to avenge Wen family,

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.020
just do as I say.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.220
Do not tell anyone.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.340
I was not lying.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.420
Then your father must have been lying.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.660
No.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.820
I just wanted to avenge my father,

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.100
and avenge Wen family.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.670
What did I do wrong?

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:37.900
Luo,

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.140
I understand your desire
to avenge your father,

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.460
but if you simply
push this onto Prince Yu,

00:09:44.475 --> 00:09:45.819
the Xiao family case

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.740
will truly never see the light of day.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.260
Didn't you want to be my own sister?

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.020
Didn't you want to be my only family?

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.900
Why are you pressuring me too?

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.340
Yan.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:05.860
Speak!

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.220
Yan,

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.700
give him some time.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.390
I will find out the truth myself.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.660
Yan!

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.220
Xie Yunyan.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.420
Someone help me.

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.407
Young Master Xie.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.060
Tell me everything you know

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.219
about the Linchuan case.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.419
Otherwise,

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.339
I will make you realize

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.382
what it means to wish for death.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:10:59.986
Young Master Xie,

00:10:59.987 --> 00:11:00.999
listen to me!

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Young Master Xie!

00:11:06.637 --> 00:11:07.499
Young Madam,

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.859
everyone has been dismissed.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.580
That scoundrel, Prince Yu,

00:11:10.625 --> 00:11:13.345
the Xiao family's injustice
is finally going to be revealed.

00:11:13.637 --> 00:11:14.757
Thank you.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.300
I hope so.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.059
Xie Yunyan,

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.060
listen to me!

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.500
Xie Yunyan,

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.900
regarding the Linchuan case,

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.220
I truly

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.780
only wanted to see General Xiao
suffer a crushing defeat.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.339
That way, he wouldn't be able
to return to the capital

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.220
and accuse me of smuggling salt.

00:11:48.675 --> 00:11:49.979
But I never imagined

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.460
that overnight,

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.259
the tide of battle
in Linchuan would turn so sharply,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.020
and the city would actually fall!

00:11:56.775 --> 00:11:58.095
The Xiao army

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.180
was completely annihilated.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.620
Then why did you still
slander my father and brothers

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.200
for colluding with the enemy and treason?

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.739
With the defeat at Linchuan, His Majesty would
be furious and certainly seek the true culprit.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:07.339
I...

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.260
I would definitely
not be able to escape blame.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.699
But the real traitor was someone else.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.357
So I had no choice but to

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.740
strike first.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.420
You contemptible villain!

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.695
My death is insignificant,

00:12:21.287 --> 00:12:23.927
but if I take the blame
for the Xiao family's crime,

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.140
you will be letting the real culprit go!

00:12:29.525 --> 00:12:31.045
You must protect me.

00:12:31.487 --> 00:12:32.967
If you catch the real culprit,

00:12:33.387 --> 00:12:35.307
I can testify for you!

00:12:37.212 --> 00:12:38.459
Who is the true culprit?

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:39.540
Speak!

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:42.500
Yan!

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.059
Yang Hong was suddenly called away.

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.432
We must leave quickly.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.140
Xie Yunyan!

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.299
Xie Yunyan, you have to save me!

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.140
Xie...
