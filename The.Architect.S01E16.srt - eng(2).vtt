Don't worry.

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:12.050
I've sent the Qilin Guards

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.280
to keep a close watch on
Prince Duan's Residnece last night.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.919
They've had no time or chance

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:16.800
to move their assets.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.239
No gold or silver was found.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.560
What's going on?

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.880
At your wits' end, huh?

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:58.119
Pei Yu,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.280
I'd like to see how you deal with me.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.560
Guards,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.640
bring my horse.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.480
I'm going to the palace right now
to seek His Majesty's audience.

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:16.000
Hold on.

00:02:14.575 --> 00:02:16.325

(If you die, it'll only be by my hand!)

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.375
(Ledger)

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:28.439
Pei Yu,

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.280
the Xiao family

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.439
helped the late Emperor

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.000
ascend the throne.

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:34.639
Even His Majesty

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:36.159
must give the late Emperor some face.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.919
You think

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.919
you can topple me

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.879
with just this?

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.960
Indeed,

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.439
if it weren't only embezzlement
and lining your own pockets,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.260
at most you'd face
confiscation of property.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.599
But Prince Duan's Residence

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:52.360
smuggled iron ore

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:53.520
and disrupted state order.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.719
That crime condemns your entire clan.

00:03:00.087 --> 00:03:02.150
(Ledger)

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:13.280
This waterway chart

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.990
was stolen from the Shen family,
wasn't it?

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.919
You coveted their shipping routes.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.960
To smuggle iron ore,

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.420
you framed the Shen family
for colluding with the enemy,

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.599
causing their whole family
to be executed.

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:27.599
(Why does she know)

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:28.919
(the Shen family's case so well?)

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:30.400
(Could it be...)

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.280
With the witnesses and evidence,

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:40.560
your guilt is confirmed.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.199
Take Prince Duan and Xiao Huaijin
into custody

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.199
and escort them to prison for trial.

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:47.400
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.879
Let go of me!

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.000
Let go of me!

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.199
Move.

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:53.080
I can walk on my own.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.680
Let go!

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.390
His Majesty wants you to settle
the Canal Guild case within three days,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.260
only then will he consider
overturning the Shen family's case.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.919
Isn't he making things hard for you?

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.520
The Canal Guild is secretly
training their own troop.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.120
They're as vicious as ever.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.199
This is no different from rebellion.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.190
They trade on land
and turn into bandits on water.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:20.759
If they weren't ruthless,

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.439
they would've been wiped out long ago.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.390
The Canal Guild
has been a scourge for years

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.959
that I've wanted to get rid of.

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.712
Now that I have the imperial order,
I can eliminate them once and for all.

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:32.120
Alright.

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:33.879
I'll bring the Qilin Guards

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:34.759
and wipe them out.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.120
Eliminating them is easy,

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.970
but keeping the grain routes running
is hard.

00:04:40.012 --> 00:04:42.199
If the supply line breaks,
the people will panic.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.439
We can only win them over gently.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.279
Two.

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:49.800
But we only have three days.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.079
Isn't it too difficult?

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.399
Any delay will cause trouble.

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:55.759
You head back first.

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:57.560
I have an idea.

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:51.759
The Xiao family said

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:52.759
there would be spies.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.639
And here

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:54.519
I'm catching

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:56.720
a big fish.

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:58.399
Stop struggling.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.800
The Celestial Cage is
forged from refined metal.

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:03.199
It's made to lock up skilled men
like you.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.759
Well done.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.399
You really caught him.

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:11.079
I can't believe Governor Pei came here.

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:12.800
I'm flattered.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.360
But you broke into the Canal Guild

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.759
on your own.

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:18.519
Aren't you overestimating yourself?

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.079
True.

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:25.079
For the Canal Guild
to defy the imperial court is sheer folly.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.199
I hope your bones

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:30.480
are as tough as your mouth.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.399
Watch him.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.800
Lock him up
for three days and three nights.

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:37.800
We'll talk once he's cooled off.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.920
Yes.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.040
(Pei Yu,)

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.680
(thank you for helping me uncover the truth
behind the Shen family's case.)

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.759
(But Yunqi, where are you?)

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:00.439
Miss.

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:02.120
It's late. You should rest.

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:05.439
Has Governor Pei returned?

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.720
He hasn't come back
since he left this morning.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.839
Maybe something held him up.

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:17.160
Miss,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.399
are you worried about him?

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:21.399
Nonsense.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.759
Why would I worry about him?

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.240
Yes.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.519
You're not.

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:29.519
But why have you been stuck on
the same page all day?

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.480
I...

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:38.319
I'm worried Prince Duan's case

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:39.519
might go wrong again.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.560
I have no news about that.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.160
But I heard the guards
who came back said

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.920
the Governor went with Commander Qin
to investigate the Canal Guild.

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:53.120
Canal Guild?

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.279
This is bad!

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:57.000
Fire!

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.879
Put the fire out!

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:58.480
Hurry!

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:11.279
Why are you here?

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.319
If I didn't come,

00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:13.839
you'd be trapped to death in here.

00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:16.800
I have my own way out.

00:08:17.675 --> 00:08:19.120
Perhaps you'd be killed

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.487
before you even escaped.

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:34.000
This is the Celestial Cage.

00:08:34.487 --> 00:08:36.399
Seamless and unbreakable.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.159
No force can break it.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:39.840
You can't break it,

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.480
but that doesn't mean I can't.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.679
This is the Celestial Cage.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.519
The...

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.519
The Shen family searched everywhere
for good craftsmen

00:08:54.519 --> 00:08:55.840
to build this mechanism.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.600
It was meant to capture beasts.

00:08:58.159 --> 00:08:58.879
I didn't know

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.200
it could capture humans.

00:09:00.759 --> 00:09:01.600
This fire

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.120
seems strange.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.320
Do you think

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:07.840
someone has come to rescue Pei Yu?

00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:09.919
Go check.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.080
They couldn't have gone far.

00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:14.960
Search!

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:15.879
Search!

00:09:23.039 --> 00:09:23.519
I know

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.960
you snuck into the Canal Guild
to investigate the Shen family's case

00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:28.360
and purposely ignored me.

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:32.039
I never thought

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:34.720
you'd risk your life to save me.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.600
Don't flatter yourself.

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:40.440
I just think

00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:41.600
that if you die,

00:09:41.919 --> 00:09:43.399
it'll only be by my hand.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.039
(Even if you don't trust me,)

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.759
(I'm willing to stay in your shadow.)

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.919
Kill her!

00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:55.799
Don't you dare hurt her!

They plan to use the Canal Guild
to challenge the imperial court.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:04.840
I wanted to

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.440
lure out the Xiao family's remnants

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.790
Once we bring
the Canal Guild under control,

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:29.470
everything will move forward as planned.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.519
How do you plan to do it?

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.840
How much do you know about
the Canal Guild?

00:11:36.879 --> 00:11:38.759
Whatever the Shen family knew,

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.039
I know as well.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.279
Good.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.799
With you here, our plans will fall
perfectly into place.

00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:54.087
(End of Episode)

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.039
(May all go smoothly
for the Governor.)

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:57.559
(May everything he seeks come true.)

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.000
Burn

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:00.480
all these charms.

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:09.639
If anything happens to her,

00:12:09.639 --> 00:12:11.000
you'll be buried with her.
