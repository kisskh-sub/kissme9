Where's your suitcase?

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.288
Let me pack it for you.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.680
I can pack it myself.

00:02:03.688 --> 00:02:04.733
You should pack your own.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.450
I'm already done packing.

00:02:07.155 --> 00:02:08.730
I still need to take my time choosing.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.060
Just leave me alone.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.010
What is this?

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.530
Did something go wrong?

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.060
Did I do something wrong?

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.460
Li Wu.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.340
Nothing went wrong.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.850
I just never planned to go
from the start.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.780
You...

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.100
I... No...

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.940
We prepared so much together.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.059
We even looked for a place,

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.560
and planned our future life together.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.888
And now you tell me
that you never planned to go at all?

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.750
Did I do something wrong?

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.590
Did I upset you?

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.130
Or...

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.690
Is it because of that night?

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.030
I was too impulsive.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.422
Because I thought you were willing.

00:03:43.466 --> 00:03:44.660
Li Wu, calm down.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.810
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.180
And I'm not trying to leave you.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.910
I just didn't know

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.010
how to convince you.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.410
So I used this method.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.290
I don't want you to give up

00:03:58.422 --> 00:03:59.911
your chance to go abroad for me.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.500
What did I even give up?

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.000
I just

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.460
want to be with you!

00:04:04.666 --> 00:04:05.430
If you go abroad,

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.730
we'd still be together.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.380
What I mean by "together"

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.060
is the two of us can

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.380
always be together

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.222
every moment and every second,

00:04:13.422 --> 00:04:14.530
not separated by distance.

00:04:15.488 --> 00:04:16.950
If you make me leave for two years,

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.820
how is that any different
from us being apart?

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.140
Of course it's different.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.100
You'd be studying abroad.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.580
It's not a breakup.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.730
And even if we're apart,

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.410
our bond

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.900
won't disappear.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.360
Whenever I have time,

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.950
I'll definitely

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:35.730
visit you.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.260
I can't bear it either.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.920
Studying abroad

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.220
is a great chance for you
to broaden your horizons.

00:04:44.022 --> 00:04:45.930
I think you should go out
and see the world.

00:04:46.022 --> 00:04:47.160
And opportunities like this

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.660
are hard to get again once missed.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.720
I don't want you

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.850
to give it up
just because you're confused.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.430
This is important for you.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.220
Important for what?

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.270
That's what you think.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.900
It's not what I think.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:02.430
Can you not

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.310
force your ideas

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.700
onto me?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.920
I'm not stupid.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.170
I can think for myself.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.120
In my heart,

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.660
the most important person is you.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.000
Li Wu.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.660
If we weren't together today,

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.070
I'd respect

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.970
all your choices.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.140
But we are together now.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.830
I can't keep seeing you

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.160
sacrifice your own opportunities

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.900
for my sake.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.870
You changed your university

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:39.660
for me during NCEE.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.930
And now you're giving up
on going abroad.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.920
Of course, I know

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.480
it's because you can't bear to leave me.

00:05:47.488 --> 00:05:48.490
I understand. I do.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.700
But I...

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.020
If you keep doing this,

00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:54.700
this bond will eventually
turn into a burden for us.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.610
I can't let you do this.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.160
I don't want to become

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.666
the string that's holding you back.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.930
I just want to be held by you.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.290
I want to be with you.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.190
I'll take responsibility

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.900
for my own life.

00:06:14.044 --> 00:06:15.900
If you want to be responsible
for yourself,

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.730
then go study properly.

00:06:32.933 --> 00:06:34.288
Li Wu, what are you doing?

00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:34.900
Li Wu!

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.460
You...

00:06:35.555 --> 00:06:36.830
Li Wu, what are you doing?

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:37.340
You...

00:06:37.888 --> 00:06:38.720
What are you doing?

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.530
I'm not going!

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.140
If it weren't for you

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:43.490
lying to me,

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.370
saying we'd go together,

00:06:45.422 --> 00:06:46.866
I wouldn't have gone to the faculty

00:06:46.888 --> 00:06:48.340
to apply for a second chance.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.100
I'm going to be away for two years.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.870
If anything changes during that time,

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.970
you're not worried at all?

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:00.040
Is studying abroad

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.290
really that important?

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.340
Of course, I'd worry.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.780
But I have faith in us.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:13.370
Besides,

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.000
it's not just

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.020
about studying abroad.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.100
What about your life plan?

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.390
You told me back then

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:22.900
you wanted to leave the mountain.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:24.780
Where are your dreams?

00:07:24.844 --> 00:07:25.870
What about your ambitions?

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:26.850
Where are your pursuits?

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.170
Now all you think about
is our relationship.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.160
Is your life

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.040
revolving around me?

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.340
I have plans!

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.410
I've got it all figured out!

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:40.050
You...

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.580
Why can't you just trust me?

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.340
And why do you get
to make this decision for me?

00:08:00.266 --> 00:08:02.088
If it weren't for me
making decisions for you,

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.100
you'd still be in Yunfeng Village now.

You're not a child anymore.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.290
I've thought about so much for you.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:32.910
Can you

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:34.220
also think for yourself?

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.180
I just want to be with you.

We're already together.

I won't regret it.

I really regret it.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.490
I used to think

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.100
being together

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.540
was to make us better for each other.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.490
Not to make you like this now,

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.300
completely irrational,

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.540

over here.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.000
What did I study in college?

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.210
You should be able to tell.

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:31.850
Broadcast hosting.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.780
You can tell, right?

00:26:35.577 --> 00:26:37.450
Studied broadcast hosting
in the Northeast.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:40.000
Back then, I asked myself,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:40.830
where should

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:42.070
I do an internship?

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.510
They said,

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:43.830
just go check out Beijing.

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:45.890
There are many opportunities in Beijing.

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:47.270
I arrived in Beijing in 2015.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:48.070
Then I found out,

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:49.410
Beijing has too many options.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.930
For example, renting a place.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.410
Why are you laughing at me?

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.340
Is it not okay to naturally smile?

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.170
Okay.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.300
Haven't seen you for more than ten days.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:17.260
You don't even drink at the reunion.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.130
Do you really just want to send me back?

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.000
You miss me that much,

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.820
then, please come upstairs and sit.

00:28:30.044 --> 00:28:31.244
You've had too much to drink

00:28:31.311 --> 00:28:32.650
and are starting to talk nonsense.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.100
Sorry.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.400
Didn't spill on you, right?

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:12.100
I'll take out the trash.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:27.541
(To Stray Cat: With this comb as a gift,)

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.311
(may you comb out a beautiful life.
From Chang)

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.022
I thought you didn't watch live streams.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.060
Stray Cat.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.580
Quite a unique taste.

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:41.130
This is...

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:26.370
Where are you?

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.580
Shen Yiyang.

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:48.690
Shen Yiyang.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.500
He left?

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:01.540
What?

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:09.130
(Sorry.)

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:10.822
(Today, there is a yellow alert.)

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:12.610
(The office needs me there temporarily.)

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:14.210
(I left breakfast for you.)

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:15.777
(If nothing comes up today,)

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.610
(don't go out.)

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:23.540
Play hard to get.

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.980
- (Recently, the new system is in trial.)
- (Keep going.)

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:02.880
Here.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.270
Thanks.

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:03.850
No problem.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.450
Fresh food delivery.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:18.930
Leave it at the door.

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.890
Okay.

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:06.888
Move a bit to the right.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.450
Move forward a little more.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.130
What am I feeling guilty about?

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.370
(The placement plan)
The above is our advertising concept

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:43.960
for this time.

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:44.350
Next,

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:45.890
let's look at the placement plan.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:46.830
This time,

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:48.177
(Main marketing strategy)
we will use

00:33:48.177 --> 00:33:49.550
both online and offline channels.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.440
Online,

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.960
we'll have ordinary people

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.933
express their understanding
of the scent of love,

00:33:53.955 --> 00:33:56.690
making a short video to release online.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:57.640
Offline,

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.590
we will select

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:01.030
art galleries in top-tier cities

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:03.110
to hold exhibitions on the scent of love

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:04.100
for promotion.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.160
Next, let's look

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.580
at the short video we made.

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:12.730
(About the scent of love,)

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.420
(it's the autumn dusk.)

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.730
(I am asleep,)

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.980
(and you cover me with a blanket.)

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.000
(The breeze)

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.540
(blowing through the hallway)

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:23.290
(brings peace of mind.)

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.650
(About the scent of love,)

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:30.100
(it's when we brush past each other,)

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.380
(and you wear perfume
you haven't changed in years.)

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:38.000
(About the scent of love,)

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.500
(it's in sleep,)

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.860
(whispering in dreams.)

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:06.550
(Is it only this way)

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:07.610
(that I can keep you?)

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:17.190
(Cen Jin,)

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.480
(I've already told you before,)

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.690
(I'm not a child anymore.)

00:35:20.555 --> 00:35:22.290
During the six months you drove me away,

00:35:23.711 --> 00:35:25.733
every time I closed my eyes,
I dreamed of you.

00:35:26.333 --> 00:35:27.590
I was afraid to dream of you,

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:28.810
yet I wanted to dream of you.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.550
Later, night after night,

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:31.330
I couldn't sleep.

00:35:33.533 --> 00:35:34.320
I even went to see

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.500
the school psychologist.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.210
He told me,

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.290
time can solve everything.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:41.210
Time can wash away all pain.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.880
But why is it that time

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:44.900
doesn't work at all for me?

00:35:49.088 --> 00:35:50.280
(If I didn't say this,)

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.444
(would you come closer to me?)

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.020
I admit I lied to you.

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:54.400
This may seem to you

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.330
dishonorable.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.210
I also feel ashamed.

00:35:57.333 --> 00:35:59.430
I just can't control myself
from coming closer to you.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:00.650
I know what I'm doing.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.810
And you?

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.230
Can you guarantee

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:07.730
that your kindness to me recently

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:09.860
is purely out of obligation?

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:12.250
Just seeing me as a younger brother?

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.940
Alright.

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.960
This concludes

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.330
all the content we presented today.

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:21.800
What do you think of that?

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:22.540
Pretty good.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.480
Our proposal today

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.590
was really successful.

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:34.866
Let's find a place to celebrate.

00:36:34.866 --> 00:36:35.666
How about hotpot?

00:36:35.666 --> 00:36:36.920
Hotpot goes best with rainy days.

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:37.810
Sure.

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:38.730
Jin.

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:39.860
Let's go for dinner.

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.860
You take everyone to eat.

00:36:43.133 --> 00:36:44.844
I have something to do. I'll go first.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:46.210
But it's raining heavily.

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:47.880
Jin. The rain is too heavy.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:48.940
Drive safely.

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:06.920
Yi.

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:07.770
Call Li Wu.

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:10.940
(Li Wu)

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:12.100
Hello.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.330
The number you dialed is busy.

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:16.130
Please try again later.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.880
The subscriber you dialed is busy.

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:28.980

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.540
(Repair mode activated)

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:34.860
Hello.

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.690
Hello.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:37.030
Sorry,

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:38.020
I was in a meeting.

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.960
Well...

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.840
Li Wu, the other day you asked me

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.060
if I knew what I was doing.

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:43.610
I have the answer now.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:44.940
I...

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.660
(Cannot access mobile network)

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.780
(Battery low)

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:14.740
(Lu Tong)

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:19.460
Hello.

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:22.170
Hello.

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.130
This is Li Wu.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:24.420
Lu Tong.

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:25.290
Hello.

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:26.380
Hello, Mr. Li.

00:38:26.666 --> 00:38:28.030
Do you know where Cen Jin went?

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:28.860
I can't reach her.

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.400
Jin was with us today

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.020
for a meeting near Shaping Road.

00:38:32.044 --> 00:38:34.060
She said she had something
to do and left first.

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:35.770
Do you know where she went?

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.070
I don't know.

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:37.900
She didn't say.

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:39.480
But there's heavy rain today,

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.570
and many roads are closed.

00:38:40.577 --> 00:38:42.177
Only Litang Road can enter the city.

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:43.190
When we came,

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:44.200
we took that road too.

00:38:44.222 --> 00:38:45.190
She left not long ago.

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:47.060
She should be halfway there by now.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.460
Litang Road.

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:49.250
Okay.

00:38:50.066 --> 00:38:51.555
Thanks. Sorry to bother you.

00:38:58.110 --> 00:38:58.920
(Where are you?)

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.333
(Do you want me to pick you up?)

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:08.340
(Mr. Wang)

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.250
Hello, Mr. Wang.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:12.540
Lu.

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:14.060
Are you free now?

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:16.250
Come to my office.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.380
It's about going to Xiehe
for further training.

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:20.380
The faculty has already discussed it.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.610
Okay, I'll be there right away.

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:34.610
Feeling better?

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:46.860
What's wrong?

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:49.444
Is there something on my face?

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.020
No.

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.690
It's hot.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.020
Now I have fully recovered.

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:24.170
Then...

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:26.860
Let's go home.
