Hou Liangyuan is very likely

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.700
the Jiang Yongquan
we've been looking for.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.020
That's also the reason
why the task force

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.510
sent you to go undercover.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.550
The person is right beside us,

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.640
but the evidence
is still hanging on a cliff.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.440
Find a way to follow Hou Liangyuan

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.070
and take down the trafficking gang

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.280
behind him.

(Wuyang City News)
The ribbon-cutting ceremony

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.630
for the opening

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.150
of Manwu Green Farm Tourist Resort

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.840
officially begins.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.680
If you don't want to watch, then don't.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.840
Mr. Gao is more important.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.630
One resort in exchange for one USB drive

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.030
is not a loss.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.800
Hou Liangyuan

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.630
told me

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.560
Xu Yi added a password to the USB drive.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.800
He must be the one who killed Xu Yi.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.270
I think

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.480
he just wants to take it all.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.400
Don't be angry.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.400
Say some nice words to Mr. Gao.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.280
Ask him to wait for several days.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.280
You really are generous.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.750
I have no choice.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.000
Am I not yours?

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.590
You still want me to go?

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.000
This is also for us.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.710
But I'm preparing for pregnancy.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.240
Haven't you always wanted

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.360
a child of ours?

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.840
How obedient.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.870
Don't make me go.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.870
Alright.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.830
The tech dpt. has analyzed it.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.730
Among the projects handled
by Zhao Xueli,

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.910
those related to Mai Boyuan

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.910
have no issues.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.310
Only one ledger related to investment

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.150
has gone missing.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.200
Hu Bo happened to be in charge

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.350
of this investment project.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.280
Other people in their company

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.840
have no knowledge of the project.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.520
Now, Hu Bo and Zhao Xueli

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.360
are both dead.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.030
The lead ends here again.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.680
Captain He,

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.530
I had Liu Ming investigate Liu Wanyao's

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.250
social activities
over the past 10 years.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.000
No records in two years.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.830
She might be under house arrest

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.800
in Xu Yi's clubhouse.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.010
This is relevant info

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.150
about Zhao Xueli's company.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.820
(Leisure farm; Ledger lost)

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.510
Have you checked the identities

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.070
of those women in the surveillance?

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.920
We're comparing with the database.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.410
The results should be available

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.370
within a day or two.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.490
Once the results come out,

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.130
inform Yin Wei

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.180
and let him go find them.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.260
Sure, I'll be going now.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.160
What's on your mind?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.390
These people are really jerks.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.680
Those girls just graduated.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.070
It's still just speculation.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.450
There's no evidence yet.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.200
Understood.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:01.350
I'll go check.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.320
Sorry that you had to put up with this.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.190
I bought a gift for you.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.640
Do you like it?

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.110
What about Mr. Gao?

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.120
No chance of easing things?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.070
Did you explain it?

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.360
Mr. Gao used to bring me money.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.750
Now, he's targeting me.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.520
One sentence from me

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.360
can make the project I invested in

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.870
lose everything with no return.

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.430
This is my biggest investment.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.950
It is our lifeline.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.600
Did you do your best?

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:25.600
I'm already like this.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.000
What do you think?

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.310
Xu Yi's death came at the wrong time.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.030
It's Hou Liangyuan's fault.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.630
With the resort,

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.720
he thought everything was fine.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:49.920
I've started short-selling.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:51.510
He won't even find

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.430
a place to cry.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.510
Will he give you

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:58.720
the USB drive that way?

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.270
I have to prepare
for both possibilities.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.200
If he hands it over,

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.160
everything can be discussed.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.730
If he doesn't hand it over,

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.310
I can only go to another place

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.160
and start over.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.920
Speaking of which,

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.430
if Liang Xinyue

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:31.630
hadn't brought the clues

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.270
to Hou Liangyuan,

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.310
the police would surely

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.510
have followed Xu Yi's trail to me.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.430
She's the one who can handle things.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.000
You want to cut ties with me?

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.200
That's fine.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.390
Transfer the remaining batch

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.560
of the paintings I took

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:54.560
from your company.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:56.870
When it's done,

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.720
we will be clear.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.240
The last batch.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.630
Rest assured, Ms. Liang.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.230
Don't worry.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:09.750
As you said, I've converted

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.510
the money he laundered abroad

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:12.360
into gold

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.680
and stored it

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.000
in a safe overseas in your name.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.760
You'd better get the delivery order

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.240
from Liang Xinyue asap.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.270
Don't worry.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.190
I know what to do.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:41.700
(Yifang Courtyard)

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.200
Ms. Liang.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.870
Are all the exhibits arranged?

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.520
13 pieces are being maintained.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.900
They can be arranged by tonight.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:57.950
Show me the list of the last batch.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.300
(Liang Xinyue)

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.320
(At the beginning,)

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.750
(I thought I was avenging Xinxin.)

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.150
(Hu Bo)
(Actually, it was for myself.)

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.000

(Xu Yi)
(In my view,)

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.020
(human trafficking is the greatest evil)

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.020
(in this world.)

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.150
(Sometimes, I even hope)

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.270
(that I'd died that day.)

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.850
(Liang Xinyue, Mai Boyuan)
(Before more people get hurt,)

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.360
(I will send you to hell.)

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:18.940
(Mai Boyuan, Hou Liangyuan, Xu Yi)

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:35.700
(Xu Yi; Recently; Resort)

(Reward Notice,
Wuyang Public Security Bureau)

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.200
We need to cooperate.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.750
That resort needs investment now.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:50.670
Mr. Hou, I have no money.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:53.080
Officer Xu,

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.200
you've been suspended.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.000
What can you offer me?

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.040
I was suspended

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.030
because of Mai Boyuan.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.320
You're also having a hard time

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.080
because of Mai Boyuan, right?

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.300
How do you know

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.440
Mai Boyuan is behind this?

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.790
Before Xu Yi died, he said,

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:14.590
"Hou Liangyuan."

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.080
"Be careful."

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.840
How should this be understood?

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:21.670
Was he telling others
to be careful of you,

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.910
or telling you to be careful of others?

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.120
As far as I know,

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:32.190
Mai Boyuan invited someone back

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:33.310
from abroad

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.550
to solve problems for him.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.670
That person killed

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:37.910
both Hu Bo

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.600
and Zhao Xueli.

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:41.870
Could you

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.200
be his next target?

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.080
Great writer,

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.540
are you making up stories?

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.870
I can tell you who this person is.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.320
Can you bring him here?

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.730
I have a way to bring him here.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.910
You are a cop.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.200
I don't trust you.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:32.570
You can call the police.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.320
How do you plan to handle Mai Boyuan?

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.750
Are you going to cooperate with me

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:44.960
or not?

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:46.670
What exactly do you want?

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.440
Evidence of the truth
behind Zhao Xueli's death.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.030
Then I'll wait for your good news.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.200
Goodbye.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.000
Interesting.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.270
That move can be made now.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.500
(Case Clue Analysis)

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.800
Director Feng.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.550
Release the Witness Reward Notice

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:57.960
for Xu Yi's death scene.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:14.840
You've suffered lately.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:16.910
Is there no one to share

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:18.790
your work?

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.030
Hou Liangyuan has a USB drive.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.610
Decrypt it and then give it to me.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.420
(Original Coffee)

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.880
(One Million Yuan)
This is the deposit.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.360
After you give it to me,

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.970
I will give you the remaining half.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.910
He doesn't have to be alive, right?

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.300
I only want the USB drive.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:49.350
I don't care about anything else.

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.660
(One Million Yuan)

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:55.870
The USB drive looks like this.

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:57.640
He keeps a close watch on it.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.670
He puts it in a very safe place

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.150
or carries it with him.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:04.910
Useless words.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.300
(One Million Yuan)

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.440
Why did you lose so many things?

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.960
So much leverage in others' hands.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.630
Why do you talk so much?

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.440
Ms. Zhao,

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.320
bracelets aren't for you.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.270
They're like shackles.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:15.630
Have a seat.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.280
Does it hurt?

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.510
You need to know

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:47.670
who I am doing this for.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:48.910
Of course, I know.

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:51.390
I feel very guilty

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:53.790
for failing to protect you.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.160
Can that man

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.200
really get the USB drive?

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.030
He handled

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.030
the ledger well.

00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:14.270
As you know,

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:16.750
Mr. Gao is in a hurry to get it.

00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:18.440
This thing is too critical.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.510
I can't guarantee

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.440
whether he can get it back.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.830
But he's completed so many

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:26.920
difficult tasks.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.480
Let's wait.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:29.830
Give him some time.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.000
Why not tell me about you moving?

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.890
I haven't had the chance.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.750
I didn't expect you to be here.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.000
You care about me so much?

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.830
Your fruit is a bit stale.

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.020
I'm not the first one
to warm your house, am I?

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:36.750
Zhao Xin,

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:38.440
PR Manager of Longyuan Group,

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.480
has been here.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:43.830
What do you want to do?

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:45.920
Or

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.640
what do you need me to do?

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:56.350
I want the truth.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.160
The truth

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.650
about how I reached this point today.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.440
What is your answer?

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.440
Zhao Xin and I

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.020
are not in a relationship.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:19.790
I need to help her retrieve something.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.400
Perhaps the truth you want

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:25.350
is right inside.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:27.350
What about you?

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:28.840
A result.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:31.160
One that only you

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.240
can give me.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:34.300
Even if it's a result you don't want?

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.880
No one knows

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:37.500
what the result will be

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.540
until the very last step.

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:58.300
(No fake passport for going abroad.)

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.180
(No receipt order.)

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.040
Xu Jingzhi?

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:30.310
Oh, the crow is here.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:34.400
Who are you drinking with?

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:37.720
You're back.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.030
Who else could I drink with?

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.270
Who's influencing you now?

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:52.240
Emotions.

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.950
My foot.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.040
- What's wrong?
- It hurts.

00:21:59.070 --> 00:21:59.910
How did that happen?

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:02.440
I twisted it while chasing a suspect.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:03.920
What suspect?

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:04.760
Just two thieves.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.600
What's going on?

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:06.870
Come on.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.110
No offense, but you're too competitive.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.790
What's the point?

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.750
Aren't you the captain?

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:14.830
How much have you drunk?

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:18.440
I just started drinking.

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:20.510
How come it feels like you're drunk?

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.960
It's the case, not the wine.

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:25.310
The case?

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.790
You're suspended. What case is it?

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.240
Wow, drunk as a lord.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.200
Why should I worry?

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.070
I've been suspended, yeah.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.070
It's because of you.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:44.880
Because of me?

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.640
Am I the reason why you became a cop?

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:50.000
You...

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:51.720
Why did you become a cop?

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.110
Because

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:54.440
I liked it myself.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.550
Of course, now it's more...

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.650
It's more about responsibility.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.000
And you?

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:06.850
Why did you become a cop?

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.880
You've made huge progress.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.260
Do you dare to say your father

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.300
isn't part of the reason?

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.270
I can only say you've improved.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:17.750
I became a cop because of you.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:19.850
It hasn't changed even now.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.560
Of course.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:22.880
My career

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.110
as a cop

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:25.440
has different stages.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:26.720
It was because of you before.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:27.680
As I kept working,

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.160
I felt that being a cop could give me

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.400
a chance for self-exploration.

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:34.750
Now, I think

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.510
one's true self has nothing

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.270
to do with their job.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:40.860
I don't give a darn now.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.160
Watch your language.

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:43.750
That language makes me

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:45.240
seem more manly, right?

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:46.390
You don't like it?

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:48.680
You've gained a lot of insights

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.510
while staying at home lately.

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:56.780
Will you still teach me

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:57.780
ways to relieve anxiety?

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.720
Sure.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.000
Inhale.

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:23.960
Why breathe with your chest?

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:25.720
I just realized it.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.880
Can you be serious?

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.270
Everyone breathes with their abdomen.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:32.350
I am using my abdomen.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:33.450
Stop staring at my chest;

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:34.590
then it won't be a problem.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:35.520
But your chest

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.720
naturally rises and falls.

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:40.440
I can't press it down.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:42.320
Come on.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.440
Don't joke around.

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:45.960
Breathe with your abdomen.

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:47.590
Focus on the position.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:48.920
The key area is the abdomen.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:50.440
Not the chest.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.300
Look.

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:52.260
My hand is placed here.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.040
Yes, yes.

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:56.760
- I know.
- Get ready.

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:57.970
No distracting thoughts.

00:24:58.550 --> 00:24:59.390
Inhale.

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:02.150
Much better.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:03.870
Hold on.

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:06.390
One.

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:08.590
Two.

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:10.950
Three.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:15.590
Hold on.

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:17.590
One.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:19.630
Two.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:21.670
Three.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:23.800
Four.

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:25.870
Five.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:26.870
Hold on.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.040
Six.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:30.940
(Safe travels)

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:31.830
Mai Boyuan,

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.070
how is it going?

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.290
Don't worry.

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:35.750
The video will be retrieved soon.

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:38.430
By the way, Mr. Gao,

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.350
about the project you helped me get,

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.400
can the payment be made asap?

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.790
What's the rush?

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.350
Give me the video first.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.740
I'm on a business trip
in Hong Kong, China.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.920
I'll apologize to you once I get back.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.830
You'll surely have the video.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.400
I'm sending you two new goods.

00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:58.630
What do you think?

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:00.960
How considerate.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.510
Alright, it's settled then.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.720
Xu Yi teamed up

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.540
with Monkey to blackmail me

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:10.930
with Mr. Gao's video.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.110
This is really a big trouble.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.640
Don't be mad.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.160
It's just a small setback.

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:21.440
Think about the money the project makes.

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:23.000
Feeling better now?

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:27.960
You know how to cheer me up.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.910
Of course.

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:32.350
Where's your bracelet?

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:36.280
It broke; I threw it away.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.310
It wasn't worth anything anyway.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:43.150
Another day,

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:44.880
I'll give you a good one.

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.950
Sure.

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.940
(Hou)

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:53.870
Who is it?

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:55.200
Who else could it be?

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:56.870
I think he

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.440
should be called Mad Dog.

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:08.440
You promised your wife

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.400
to have dinner with her tonight.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:11.510
It's her birthday.

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:13.150
You forgot?

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.210
Then I'll head back first.

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:24.150
Go ahead.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.040
Mr. Xu?

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.950
Mr. Xu?

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.240
Mr. Xu?

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.910
Mr. Xu?

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.280
Zhuang Mingcheng.

00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:59.270
You really keep your word.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.080
Yes.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.950
Yes.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.240
That's right.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.680
This is the Xu Jingzhi I know.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.160
You always use others

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.880
to handle your affairs.

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:45.140
(Delivery order)

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:48.260
(To Zhi Fei: I got the delivery order.)
