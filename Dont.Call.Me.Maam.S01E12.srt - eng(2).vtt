(Final Episode)

00:00:38.061 --> 00:00:38.996
Drink this.

00:00:44.534 --> 00:00:45.869
You don't need to stay here.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.139
Go back to the hotel and wait.
I'll call you.

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:50.040
No, it's okay.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.609
We'll stay here.
You should at least get some sleep.

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:54.411
You must be exhausted
from coming all the way from Seoul.

00:00:54.978 --> 00:00:56.847
No, I'm fine.

00:00:57.748 --> 00:00:59.583
If you guys get sick too, then what?

00:00:59.583 --> 00:01:00.817
I'm sorry, Sang Gyu.

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:03.186
This is all my fault.

00:01:04.187 --> 00:01:06.290
If I hadn't kept nagging her...

00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:09.393
to grow up and get her act together...

00:01:11.995 --> 00:01:13.196
Actually,

00:01:14.665 --> 00:01:17.935
we didn't know
that you and Il Ri had broken up,

00:01:18.302 --> 00:01:21.171
so we kept pushing her
to get married right away.

00:01:22.306 --> 00:01:25.475
Il Ri was really hurt by it
and was having a hard time.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.644
I'm the bad one.

00:01:29.346 --> 00:01:31.014
I was completely clueless.

00:01:31.715 --> 00:01:33.317
Even after knowing her for so long,

00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:36.987
I never realized
how much she was struggling.

00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:42.793
Stay here for a bit.

00:01:42.793 --> 00:01:43.994
I'll look around some more.

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.363
Sang Gyu.

00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:04.247
Il Ri, where the hell are you?

00:02:33.944 --> 00:02:34.845
Na Jeong.

00:02:35.145 --> 00:02:35.979
Yes?

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:37.014
Please wake Joo Young.

00:02:37.247 --> 00:02:38.081
Joo Young.

00:02:38.682 --> 00:02:39.883
I'll stay here,

00:02:39.883 --> 00:02:41.551
so you go back to the hotel, okay?

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.287
If anything happens, I'll call you.

00:02:45.722 --> 00:02:48.025
I'll look around a bit more
on the way back.

00:02:49.393 --> 00:02:50.227
Okay.

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:00.203
- I'll call you.
- Yes.

00:03:27.564 --> 00:03:31.034
I've never once imagined
a life without Il Ri.

00:03:34.838 --> 00:03:36.306
In my suffocating life,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.109
Il Ri was always like a refreshing soda.

00:03:40.777 --> 00:03:42.646
Whenever anyone came at us,

00:03:44.114 --> 00:03:46.850
she was always the first to step up
and fight for us.

00:03:47.684 --> 00:03:48.952
What do I do?

00:03:50.954 --> 00:03:53.023
I can't live without Il Ri.

00:03:54.758 --> 00:03:56.493
I really can't.

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:03.834
What's that?

00:04:07.271 --> 00:04:08.438
Isn't that Il Ri?

00:04:08.438 --> 00:04:10.307
- Yes.
- Hey, pull over.

00:04:10.307 --> 00:04:11.108
Okay.

00:04:17.114 --> 00:04:18.181
Lee Il Ri.

00:04:18.181 --> 00:04:18.949
Guys.

00:04:21.718 --> 00:04:23.020
You little brat.

00:04:23.754 --> 00:04:26.123
Hey, you bad girl.

00:04:26.823 --> 00:04:28.825
I thought you were dead.

00:04:29.126 --> 00:04:31.962
Even if you were going to die,
you can't just vanish on us like this.

00:04:32.462 --> 00:04:34.798
I'm sorry.
You guys must've been really worried.

00:04:34.798 --> 00:04:37.100
Your phone was off all night.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.502
Do you know how scared we were?

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:40.370
Where did you go?

00:04:40.537 --> 00:04:44.708
Well, I went to the beach alone
and had a few drinks last night.

00:04:44.708 --> 00:04:45.442
And?

00:04:45.442 --> 00:04:48.545
I suddenly needed the restroom,
so I ducked into some random building.

00:05:28.685 --> 00:05:30.253
It's freezing.

00:05:48.338 --> 00:05:51.375
Someone who came in for work this morning
opened the door for me,

00:05:51.375 --> 00:05:52.976
so I managed to get out.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.847
After shivering all night,
I was freezing to death.

00:05:56.847 --> 00:05:58.615
So I pulled a towel
out of a used-clothes collection bin...

00:05:58.615 --> 00:06:00.784
and wrapped myself up in it.

00:06:03.153 --> 00:06:04.855
I'm sorry.

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:08.859
I couldn't tell when I was cold,
but now it smells awful.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.596
Hey, call Sang Gyu first.

00:06:12.596 --> 00:06:14.197
- He must be worried.
- Okay.

00:06:16.233 --> 00:06:18.201
- Sang Gyu? Why?
- Sang Gyu.

00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:19.303
We found Il Ri.

00:06:19.303 --> 00:06:21.972
Sang Gyu called us,
so we told him you'd gone missing,

00:06:21.972 --> 00:06:24.207
and he rushed straight here from Seoul.

00:06:24.207 --> 00:06:25.442
Sang Gyu is here right now?

00:06:25.442 --> 00:06:26.343
Yeah.

00:06:26.343 --> 00:06:28.278
This is crazy.

00:06:28.278 --> 00:06:30.714
Hey, let's hurry back to the hotel.
I need to wash up.

00:06:32.282 --> 00:06:33.116
My gosh.

00:06:34.518 --> 00:06:35.552
Seriously?

00:06:35.953 --> 00:06:38.488
Even now, she wants to look good
in front of Sang Gyu.

00:06:54.237 --> 00:06:56.907
(Marine Healing Center)

00:06:56.907 --> 00:06:57.841
Il Ri.

00:06:58.442 --> 00:06:59.610
Hey, Lee Il Ri.

00:07:01.078 --> 00:07:03.513
No, don't.
I haven't washed yet.

00:07:03.513 --> 00:07:06.116
I thought you were dead.
I honestly thought I'd lose my mind.

00:07:18.395 --> 00:07:20.097
He doesn't smell that?

00:07:20.097 --> 00:07:21.265
Does he have rhinitis or something?

00:07:21.265 --> 00:07:23.433
You kill every mood.

00:07:26.436 --> 00:07:27.871
Get this out of my sight.

00:07:36.146 --> 00:07:39.216
How could you come all the way here
in the middle of the night?

00:07:39.216 --> 00:07:41.151
What if you'd gotten into an accident?

00:07:41.752 --> 00:07:44.121
When they said you'd disappeared,

00:07:44.121 --> 00:07:46.390
I completely lost it
and couldn't see straight.

00:07:47.391 --> 00:07:48.825
But I'm in trouble now.

00:07:48.825 --> 00:07:51.295
I'm going to get
a ton of speeding tickets.

00:07:51.295 --> 00:07:52.562
I'm going to be broke.

00:07:52.562 --> 00:07:53.597
You've got some money, right?

00:07:54.131 --> 00:07:55.299
You should cover it.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:02.439
Why did you lie to me?

00:08:05.309 --> 00:08:06.310
The medicine you were taking.

00:08:07.678 --> 00:08:08.879
Those weren't vitamins.

00:08:10.013 --> 00:08:10.948
How did you know?

00:08:11.848 --> 00:08:15.052
Il Ri, you should've told me.

00:08:15.619 --> 00:08:18.221
I really had no idea
you were going through that.

00:08:23.226 --> 00:08:25.495
I didn't want to be
a burden on you, Sang Gyu.

00:08:27.331 --> 00:08:29.499
You'd have plenty of chances
even without me.

00:08:31.001 --> 00:08:32.269
I didn't want to take that away from you.

00:08:35.739 --> 00:08:36.573
Il Ri.

00:08:37.541 --> 00:08:38.709
I don't have any other chances.

00:08:39.643 --> 00:08:40.877
You're my last chance.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.648
I told you before, didn't I?

00:08:45.782 --> 00:08:48.285
That you're like a child
left by the water's edge.

00:08:50.053 --> 00:08:52.189
Feeling anxious about you
is more than enough for me.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:54.625
Even if a hundred or a thousand others
came along,

00:08:55.759 --> 00:08:57.160
I can't live without you.

00:09:01.498 --> 00:09:02.366
Lee Il Ri.

00:09:04.701 --> 00:09:06.203
Stop running away now,

00:09:09.206 --> 00:09:10.340
and marry me.

00:09:12.276 --> 00:09:13.143
Okay?

00:09:31.695 --> 00:09:33.630
- What? Why?
- Wait a second.

00:09:34.197 --> 00:09:35.365
What are you looking for?

00:09:37.067 --> 00:09:37.968
Is something there?

00:09:42.472 --> 00:09:43.307
Give me your hand.

00:10:14.638 --> 00:10:15.839
Il Ri.

00:10:15.839 --> 00:10:17.441
What if someone sees us?

00:10:17.441 --> 00:10:19.409
Stay still.

00:10:19.409 --> 00:10:21.044
This is exactly
the kind of moment I dreamed of.

00:10:45.836 --> 00:10:46.570
Guys.

00:10:47.004 --> 00:10:49.473
I'll ride in Sang Gyu's car.
You two go by yourselves.

00:10:49.473 --> 00:10:50.941
Let's meet at the rest stop.

00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:51.808
See you in a bit.

00:10:52.943 --> 00:10:54.211
Seriously?

00:10:54.211 --> 00:10:57.247
Hey, are we completely invisible
to you now?

00:10:57.247 --> 00:11:00.150
Why did we stay up all night
worrying for nothing? This is so unfair.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:01.151
Exactly.

00:11:01.885 --> 00:11:03.086
I can't even.

00:11:05.622 --> 00:11:06.823
You two can have more space.

00:11:08.392 --> 00:11:09.359
Thanks.

00:11:10.294 --> 00:11:11.094
Let's go.

00:11:20.337 --> 00:11:24.574
No matter how I think about it,
that fortune teller was spot on.

00:11:24.574 --> 00:11:28.111
How did it match Il Ri
and Sang Gyu's situation so perfectly?

00:11:28.111 --> 00:11:29.313
I know, right?

00:11:29.913 --> 00:11:32.649
I'm too scared to get spiritual readings.

00:11:32.649 --> 00:11:33.951
That one really gave me chills.

00:11:34.918 --> 00:11:35.852
Gu Joo Young.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.188
You should be honest too.

00:11:38.789 --> 00:11:41.491
Who's the man that makes your heart race
and your chest flutter?

00:11:45.062 --> 00:11:46.496
What is that reaction?

00:11:46.496 --> 00:11:47.631
So there really is someone?

00:11:48.599 --> 00:11:49.900
Where did you meet him?

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.335
What's his name?

00:11:52.102 --> 00:11:52.936
Tell me.

00:11:54.371 --> 00:11:55.439
Oh Sang Min.

00:11:56.974 --> 00:11:58.408
The Oh Sang Min I know?

00:12:01.845 --> 00:12:03.647
Actually...

00:12:03.647 --> 00:12:04.481
Yeah?

00:12:05.282 --> 00:12:07.184
About Rebecca and Jessica.

00:12:11.989 --> 00:12:14.458
I really never imagined
that Sang Min would have...

00:12:14.825 --> 00:12:16.293
such a painful story like that.

00:12:19.062 --> 00:12:22.232
Like you said,
it doesn't quite feel right...

00:12:22.232 --> 00:12:24.234
to just call that perversion, does it?

00:12:26.903 --> 00:12:30.040
Come to think of it, I'd forgotten.

00:12:31.575 --> 00:12:34.211
I think I also once had
one of those worry dolls.

00:12:34.811 --> 00:12:35.746
What do you mean?

00:12:36.813 --> 00:12:39.149
I read a book when I was little,

00:12:39.149 --> 00:12:41.485
and it said that Native Americans
keep worry dolls...

00:12:41.485 --> 00:12:44.321
by their pillow even as adults
before going to sleep,

00:12:44.321 --> 00:12:46.857
and tell them all the worries of the day.

00:12:47.224 --> 00:12:50.227
After all, most worries
are 90 percent useless anyway.

00:12:51.161 --> 00:12:52.930
So after reading that,

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.499
when my dad passed away,
and I was having a really hard time,

00:12:55.499 --> 00:12:57.200
my mom was doing side work at home...

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.869
and she gave me a leftover teddy bear.

00:12:59.336 --> 00:13:01.939
So to that teddy bear,
I rambled on and on...

00:13:01.939 --> 00:13:03.807
about this and that.

00:13:04.975 --> 00:13:07.311
Well, it was only for a short time.

00:13:07.311 --> 00:13:08.779
But back then,

00:13:08.779 --> 00:13:10.914
it was a pretty big comfort to me.

00:13:14.051 --> 00:13:17.187
In life, something that feels
completely natural to me...

00:13:17.187 --> 00:13:19.957
could seem very strange
to someone else,

00:13:21.058 --> 00:13:22.960
and something that feels
very strange to me...

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.162
could feel completely natural
to someone else.

00:13:27.331 --> 00:13:29.833
Who has the right to judge anyone
so carelessly?

00:13:32.569 --> 00:13:34.805
Think of it as your last chance...

(Joo Young)

00:15:48.272 --> 00:15:49.239
Say hi.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.943
From today on,
these worry dolls will live with me.

(Sweet Home Shopping)

00:16:11.662 --> 00:16:12.930
Here.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.431
I didn't return it.

00:16:14.865 --> 00:16:17.234
You didn't process the return
on the intranet?

00:16:17.234 --> 00:16:18.535
I missed one.

00:16:18.936 --> 00:16:21.171
Please write your former department
and name.

00:16:29.179 --> 00:16:30.414
Thank you.

00:16:34.117 --> 00:16:34.985
Ms. Cho?

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.721
Mr. Kim Ho Young.

00:16:37.721 --> 00:16:39.856
Look at you.

00:16:39.856 --> 00:16:41.592
It's been so long, honey.

00:16:41.592 --> 00:16:42.626
I know.

00:16:42.626 --> 00:16:44.528
Running into the sell-out fairy here?

00:16:45.295 --> 00:16:49.333
I came to pull Sweet Home Shopping's sales
back up again.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.102
I heard you went back on air,

00:16:52.102 --> 00:16:53.303
but I didn't get a chance to tune in.

00:16:53.303 --> 00:16:54.204
Are you doing well?

00:16:54.771 --> 00:16:56.340
I did go back,

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.774
but now I'm fired again.

00:16:57.774 --> 00:16:59.009
What? Why?

00:16:59.776 --> 00:17:01.545
Well, it's a long story.

00:17:01.545 --> 00:17:03.013
Things just ended up that way.

00:17:03.013 --> 00:17:04.848
That's unbelievable.

00:17:04.848 --> 00:17:06.650
Why couldn't Sweet Home Shopping recognize
a talent like you...

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:07.918
and just let you
slip through their fingers?

00:17:08.318 --> 00:17:10.721
So, are you trying to transfer
to another network?

00:17:11.555 --> 00:17:13.256
I'm looking into it,

00:17:13.256 --> 00:17:14.891
but it's tougher than I thought.

00:17:14.891 --> 00:17:16.727
You know how fierce the competition is.

00:17:16.727 --> 00:17:19.563
Then you should find another route too.

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:20.964
Another route?

00:17:20.964 --> 00:17:22.733
These days,
who waits to be told to go on air?

00:17:23.267 --> 00:17:24.601
All you need is this.

00:17:25.269 --> 00:17:27.170
I started YouTube and built my brand,

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.839
and that's how I got here.

00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:30.907
Even a baby has to cry to get fed.

00:17:30.907 --> 00:17:33.176
Instead of just sitting around
until you lose your edge,

00:17:33.176 --> 00:17:34.511
just go for it.

00:17:34.911 --> 00:17:37.481
These days, building your own brand
is the best move.

00:17:38.382 --> 00:17:40.250
I'd better go now.
Call me.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:41.118
Yeah, bye.

00:18:02.306 --> 00:18:05.509
(Boosted Ho Young)

00:18:29.266 --> 00:18:30.534
Hello.

00:18:30.801 --> 00:18:33.036
I'm Cho Na Jeong,

00:18:33.036 --> 00:18:34.371
a former show host
with eight years of experience.

00:18:34.371 --> 00:18:36.139
Working in this industry,

00:18:36.139 --> 00:18:38.642
there's truly nothing I haven't sold.

00:18:38.642 --> 00:18:39.610
But even someone like me...

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:43.380
has luxury items
I would never buy with my own money.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.949
Things I sold with my own hands,
but never bought.

00:18:45.949 --> 00:18:50.220
In this series,
I'll be completely honest with all of you.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.223
The show may be over,
but shopping must go on.

00:18:53.223 --> 00:18:55.192
The show must go on.

00:18:58.462 --> 00:19:00.731
(Real luxury items only sellers know
to truly avoid)

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.035
(Upload)

00:19:12.309 --> 00:19:13.377
Well done, Cho Na Jeong.

00:19:14.344 --> 00:19:15.479
Good work, Cho Na Jeong.

00:19:17.514 --> 00:19:19.349
Don't be overly ambitious from the start.

00:19:20.517 --> 00:19:21.718
Take it step by step.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.361
Bye, then.

00:19:31.361 --> 00:19:33.297
- Get home safely.
- You too.

00:19:34.765 --> 00:19:35.666
Honey.

00:19:49.513 --> 00:19:50.681
What brings you here?

00:19:51.381 --> 00:19:52.482
Did you come to see a show?

00:19:53.283 --> 00:19:55.152
No, not that.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.454
Then what?

00:19:59.156 --> 00:20:01.892
Did you come to see me?

00:20:04.061 --> 00:20:04.895
Yeah.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:07.731
Why?

00:20:08.932 --> 00:20:12.669
I wanted to apologize for last time.

00:20:15.038 --> 00:20:16.239
I snapped at you for nothing.

00:20:19.409 --> 00:20:20.911
I wasn't angry at you.

00:20:23.113 --> 00:20:24.448
I was just...

00:20:25.716 --> 00:20:27.250
so embarrassed and ashamed,

00:20:29.987 --> 00:20:32.022
and that made me lash out too much.

00:20:32.923 --> 00:20:34.992
I regretted it terribly
the moment I walked out,

00:20:34.992 --> 00:20:36.193
and I wanted to call you,

00:20:37.194 --> 00:20:38.228
but I just didn't have the courage.

00:20:41.798 --> 00:20:46.036
You came all this way to say that?

00:21:04.721 --> 00:21:06.590
It's all because I'm lacking...

00:21:09.092 --> 00:21:10.260
and not good enough.

00:21:11.662 --> 00:21:12.629
And also,

00:21:14.798 --> 00:21:16.533
thank you so much
for understanding me anyway.

00:21:19.136 --> 00:21:19.870
I'll go.

00:21:22.973 --> 00:21:25.742
I've got plenty of time,
so call me anytime.

00:21:30.647 --> 00:21:32.549
Seriously, you can call me anytime.

00:21:38.121 --> 00:21:39.089
Do you want to grab a drink?

00:21:45.429 --> 00:21:48.065
Do you have time?
Aren't you tired?

00:21:48.899 --> 00:21:50.567
You even brought flowers as a gift.

00:21:50.567 --> 00:21:52.636
It wouldn't feel right
not to buy a drink in return.

00:21:56.974 --> 00:21:58.008
Shall we, then?

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:14.191
About...

00:22:15.592 --> 00:22:16.994
Rebecca and Jessica.

00:22:19.563 --> 00:22:22.266
I'm really sorry
I couldn't be honest with you about them.

00:22:25.769 --> 00:22:28.338
They were the only friends
who ever comforted me since I was little,

00:22:30.707 --> 00:22:32.509
so I just couldn't bring myself
to cut them off.

00:22:35.379 --> 00:22:37.714
The more my feelings for you grew,

00:22:39.449 --> 00:22:40.917
the harder it became to confess.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.721
It's all because I was a coward.

00:22:46.757 --> 00:22:48.859
I ran away because I didn't even have
the courage to be honest.

00:22:50.527 --> 00:22:51.528
And once I was found out,

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:54.331
I was so ashamed...

00:22:56.166 --> 00:22:57.301
that I just gave up on everything.

00:22:58.769 --> 00:23:00.037
I'm a truly pathetic guy.

00:23:02.039 --> 00:23:03.273
I wasn't good to you myself.

00:23:05.609 --> 00:23:07.678
I got obsessed
with that whole perfect family thing,

00:23:08.845 --> 00:23:11.782
and all I ever talked about
was babies and ovulation.

00:23:12.382 --> 00:23:14.318
I'm sure you got sick of it.

00:23:15.819 --> 00:23:16.820
Come to think of it,

00:23:17.788 --> 00:23:19.423
we actually have a lot in common.

00:23:21.191 --> 00:23:23.794
Once we fixate on something,
we totally lose our heads,

00:23:25.028 --> 00:23:26.797
and we're both model students
in our own way.

00:23:29.132 --> 00:23:30.133
Maybe...

00:23:32.436 --> 00:23:34.304
I was drawn to you...

00:23:35.038 --> 00:23:37.274
because you resemble me so much.

00:23:49.353 --> 00:23:51.121
I'm sorry.

00:23:52.356 --> 00:23:54.891
I was totally dumbfounded
by that counselor too.

00:23:55.792 --> 00:23:57.261
Lecturing me out of nowhere?

00:23:57.928 --> 00:24:01.131
"Ma'am, have you ever
expressed dissatisfaction..."

00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:04.067
"with your sexual relationship
with your husband?"

00:24:04.067 --> 00:24:07.237
I was so embarrassed I wanted to die.

00:24:07.771 --> 00:24:10.073
It was that drama therapy for me.

00:24:10.073 --> 00:24:12.442
That was my real mental breakdown.

00:24:12.442 --> 00:24:14.144
- Right.
- Yeah.

00:24:14.144 --> 00:24:16.313
Wrapping weird cloth all around you,

00:24:16.313 --> 00:24:17.581
and telling you to stand up.

00:24:20.384 --> 00:24:21.251
But still,

00:24:22.219 --> 00:24:24.655
it was kind of fun.
It was a new experience.

00:24:25.355 --> 00:24:26.957
I liked it more
because I did it with you, honey.

00:24:29.593 --> 00:24:30.460
But...

00:24:31.361 --> 00:24:34.064
why did you suddenly suggest
marriage counseling back then?

00:24:35.732 --> 00:24:37.167
You won't believe me,

00:24:38.735 --> 00:24:39.836
but...

00:24:41.171 --> 00:24:42.539
I really...

00:24:44.308 --> 00:24:45.676
honestly wanted to get intimate with you.

00:24:47.678 --> 00:24:49.746
You're still the sexiest...

00:24:50.781 --> 00:24:51.682
and the most beautiful person in my eyes.

00:24:54.117 --> 00:24:54.952
I really mean it.

00:24:57.254 --> 00:24:59.456
But strangely,
whenever your ovulation day came,

00:25:00.157 --> 00:25:01.858
I got so tense
that things just didn't work.

00:25:02.693 --> 00:25:04.561
And that frustrated me too.

00:25:10.634 --> 00:25:11.768
You know,

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:14.738
that counseling...

00:25:15.772 --> 00:25:17.541
wasn't just for the baby either.

00:25:20.677 --> 00:25:22.846
Our newlywed days were really great.

00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:28.185
But saying I just wanted to do it
straight out...

00:25:28.719 --> 00:25:30.420
felt kind of embarrassing and awkward,

00:25:31.021 --> 00:25:33.156
so I think I made up a little excuse.

00:25:36.293 --> 00:25:37.094
Then...

00:25:38.929 --> 00:25:40.797
you hadn't stopped liking me?

00:25:42.933 --> 00:25:44.334
No way.

00:25:45.168 --> 00:25:47.104
I wanted to get intimate
because I liked you.

00:25:55.045 --> 00:25:56.046
Can I kiss you?

00:25:59.716 --> 00:26:01.251
Why do you even ask that?

00:26:01.985 --> 00:26:05.122
Well, still, we're divorced now.

00:26:06.757 --> 00:26:08.959
If you don't want to, never mind.

00:26:54.071 --> 00:26:56.406
Honey, slow down.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.875
This is right in front of my company.

00:26:58.875 --> 00:26:59.743
Hurry.

00:27:01.945 --> 00:27:03.413
Slow down.

00:27:03.413 --> 00:27:06.950
(Lux Hanmaeum Motel)

00:27:11.121 --> 00:27:13.223
What's up with the views?

00:27:13.957 --> 00:27:15.559
Did I get my hopes up too much?

00:27:16.293 --> 00:27:18.328
What's the problem?

00:27:27.337 --> 00:27:29.072
Ye Na, what brings you here?

00:27:29.072 --> 00:27:30.340
It's heavy.
Here, take this first.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:31.108
Okay.

00:27:35.012 --> 00:27:35.979
Why beef all of a sudden?

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.683
A partner company gave it to me
for doing well on air,

00:27:39.683 --> 00:27:41.485
but I was worried about gaining weight
and couldn't eat it all,

00:27:41.485 --> 00:27:42.686
and it felt like a waste to throw it away.

00:27:42.686 --> 00:27:44.288
So I brought it for your kids to eat.

00:27:45.188 --> 00:27:47.524

00:27:47.524 --> 00:27:49.059
You can do thoughtful stuff like this?

00:27:49.059 --> 00:27:50.260
What are you talking about?

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.095
I've always been soft-hearted.

00:27:52.095 --> 00:27:54.064
I just got worn down by life
and ended up like this.

00:27:55.866 --> 00:27:56.633
What's this?

Na Jeong, are you doing YouTube?

00:28:00.537 --> 00:28:02.339

Hey, the views are lousy
because it's my first time.

00:28:10.681 --> 00:28:12.382
If I keep at it, they'll soar.

00:28:12.382 --> 00:28:15.452
Forget the views.

00:28:15.452 --> 00:28:17.654
Since when do you deal in luxury goods?

00:28:17.654 --> 00:28:20.691
Do something that suits you, not this.

00:28:20.691 --> 00:28:22.259
This really doesn't fit you.

00:28:22.259 --> 00:28:24.027
Then what suits me?

00:28:24.027 --> 00:28:24.962
How would I know that?

00:28:26.296 --> 00:28:27.431
I'm thirsty.

00:28:27.998 --> 00:28:29.766
What kind of hospitality is this?

00:28:29.766 --> 00:28:32.235
You slept over once,
and now you're totally comfortable.

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:34.104
Do you have any sparkling water?

00:28:35.238 --> 00:28:36.139
I'll go buy some.

00:28:37.174 --> 00:28:40.410
There's really a lot.

00:28:41.945 --> 00:28:44.848
What does it even mean
to do something that suits me?

00:28:46.617 --> 00:28:47.551
Something that suits me?

00:28:49.519 --> 00:28:50.587
Something that suits me?

00:28:54.091 --> 00:28:55.759
- Mom.
- Mom.

00:28:55.759 --> 00:28:58.528
Did my little princes have fun?

00:28:58.528 --> 00:28:59.463
Yes.

00:28:59.463 --> 00:29:01.832
Mom, can we play at the playground
for a little bit?

00:29:01.832 --> 00:29:02.633
Yeah, sure.

00:29:03.333 --> 00:29:05.769
Give me your bag. Wait.

00:29:05.769 --> 00:29:07.170
Guys.

00:29:10.741 --> 00:29:13.110
Don't do anything too dangerous.

00:29:13.543 --> 00:29:15.012
Watch the stairs.

00:29:18.248 --> 00:29:20.651
Slowly. Watch the stairs.

00:29:22.119 --> 00:29:23.520
Min Woo, slowly.

00:29:25.522 --> 00:29:26.490
There.

00:29:30.427 --> 00:29:31.695
Faster.

00:29:31.695 --> 00:29:34.164
Wait a second!
What's this?

00:29:35.599 --> 00:29:37.334
Where did you get this on you?

00:29:38.835 --> 00:29:40.404
We'll have to get this cleaned off
as soon as we get home.

00:29:40.404 --> 00:29:42.606
Who left crayons here?

00:30:18.909 --> 00:30:20.978
You look so pretty.

00:30:22.245 --> 00:30:23.914
This makes no sense.

00:30:25.015 --> 00:30:27.384
Lee Il Ri, you look insanely pretty.

00:30:27.384 --> 00:30:29.286
It really suits you.

00:30:32.322 --> 00:30:34.257
Perfect. I choose this one.

00:30:34.257 --> 00:30:35.092
Me too.

00:30:42.332 --> 00:30:44.034
This one looks great on you too.

00:30:44.034 --> 00:30:46.236
You don't look human in this.
You look unreal.

00:30:51.541 --> 00:30:55.212
This is honestly unbelievable.

00:30:55.212 --> 00:30:57.648
You're blindingly gorgeous.

00:31:05.522 --> 00:31:08.091
This dress is really nice.

00:31:10.594 --> 00:31:11.929
I love it.

00:31:12.429 --> 00:31:13.597
It's good.

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.501
You look so pretty.

00:31:19.036 --> 00:31:20.604
- This one's not bad either.
- Right.

00:31:20.904 --> 00:31:21.805
Are you two tired?

00:31:22.739 --> 00:31:23.707
- No.
- No.

00:31:24.174 --> 00:31:25.042
You're not, right?

00:31:25.042 --> 00:31:26.343
That's great.

00:31:27.411 --> 00:31:28.712
You're saying everything's great.

00:31:31.148 --> 00:31:32.482
Maybe I should try on one more.

00:31:33.083 --> 00:31:34.851
One more? Okay.

00:31:35.419 --> 00:31:36.720
I'll try on one more.

00:31:42.859 --> 00:31:44.294
This one's pretty too.

00:31:45.329 --> 00:31:46.430
And this one's pretty too.

00:31:47.664 --> 00:31:48.532
Eat some meat.

00:31:48.532 --> 00:31:51.234
They all look so good on me.
I can't pick just one.

00:31:51.802 --> 00:31:54.004
Sang Gyu, which one did you like the most?

00:31:55.005 --> 00:31:56.306
They all looked pretty to me.

00:31:57.374 --> 00:31:58.508
Seriously?

00:31:58.976 --> 00:32:01.044
Are you even paying attention to me?

00:32:01.044 --> 00:32:03.880
At the end, you were dozing off
and not reacting at all.

00:32:04.514 --> 00:32:06.249
Am I getting married all by myself here?

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:10.354
They all looked beautiful to me.
I mean it.

00:32:13.757 --> 00:32:15.192
Which one did you like best?

00:32:15.359 --> 00:32:16.326
Well,

00:32:17.127 --> 00:32:19.763
I thought the first one you tried on
suited you the best.

00:32:21.265 --> 00:32:23.166
Isn't that one a bit plain, though?

00:32:23.967 --> 00:32:27.170
It's not like I can just
pick something at random.

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:28.605
I'm a deputy editor at a fashion magazine.

00:32:28.605 --> 00:32:31.008
Think how many people will be watching me.

00:32:33.744 --> 00:32:34.945
This won't do.

00:32:34.945 --> 00:32:37.814
Let's hit two more places next week.

00:32:40.183 --> 00:32:41.285
What, you don't want to?

00:32:41.952 --> 00:32:43.353
- No, it's not that.
- No.

00:32:43.353 --> 00:32:44.388
I'd actually love that.

00:32:48.191 --> 00:32:50.961
Right, Gu Joo Young, since you're coming
next week, go on a blind date.

00:32:51.528 --> 00:32:52.596
A blind date?

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:54.298
Out of nowhere?

00:32:54.298 --> 00:32:56.833
What are you talking about?
There's no "right time" for a blind date.

00:32:59.436 --> 00:33:00.671
I mean,

00:33:01.038 --> 00:33:03.607
it hasn't been that long
since the divorce.

00:33:03.607 --> 00:33:06.810
What does that matter?
You take the chance when you get it.

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:09.079
There's a divorced doctor
at Sang Gyu's hospital.

00:33:09.079 --> 00:33:10.681
Apparently, he's a really good guy.

00:33:11.415 --> 00:33:13.250
It's not like he's weird or anything.

00:33:13.717 --> 00:33:16.653
His wife cheated on him,
so he had no choice but to divorce.

00:33:17.187 --> 00:33:20.390
When you think about it, you also stepped
in crap through no fault of your own.

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:22.492
And he stepped in crap
through no fault of his own too.

00:33:22.859 --> 00:33:24.094
What a perfect match is that?

00:33:24.561 --> 00:33:27.431
No thanks, I'm good.

00:33:27.431 --> 00:33:29.533
Hey, wounds you get from people...

00:33:29.533 --> 00:33:31.168
you heal with people.

00:33:31.168 --> 00:33:32.703
While you're still even a year younger,

00:33:32.703 --> 00:33:34.771
you should meet someone decent
and start fresh.

00:33:35.138 --> 00:33:36.273
Enough.

00:33:36.273 --> 00:33:38.208
I have zero intention of seeing anyone.

00:33:39.242 --> 00:33:39.943
What's this?

00:33:41.778 --> 00:33:43.814
Are you seeing someone these days?

00:33:44.247 --> 00:33:46.116
You've been acting suspicious lately.

00:33:46.116 --> 00:33:46.917
I'm not.

00:33:47.684 --> 00:33:48.819
I'm really not.

00:33:51.788 --> 00:33:52.889
(Sang Min)

00:33:54.424 --> 00:33:55.425
Excuse me.

00:33:57.361 --> 00:33:58.362
Hey.

00:33:59.162 --> 00:34:00.397
Yeah, what's up?

00:34:02.599 --> 00:34:04.167
What?

00:34:04.167 --> 00:34:05.936
She's acting suspicious.

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:07.638
They all looked pretty.

00:34:07.638 --> 00:34:08.605
Stop it.

00:34:10.607 --> 00:34:12.743
You're almost done now, right?

00:34:13.644 --> 00:34:15.212
I'm on my way.
How long will it take?

00:34:15.212 --> 00:34:16.613
There are still three of us here right now,

00:34:16.613 --> 00:34:18.248
so don't call, just text me.

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:20.117
Have you eaten?

00:34:20.851 --> 00:34:22.085
Haven't you eaten, Sang Min?

00:34:22.986 --> 00:34:24.554
But it's already late.

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:27.691
I'm eating with Il Ri right now,

00:34:27.691 --> 00:34:29.359
so if you're hungry, grab something first.

00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:31.428
- I'll be there soon.
- Okay, see you in a bit.

00:34:31.428 --> 00:34:32.262
What?

00:34:33.196 --> 00:34:34.398
"Sang Min?"

00:34:38.201 --> 00:34:38.969
So?

00:34:39.569 --> 00:34:42.272
From that moment on,
it all started burning up again?

00:34:46.143 --> 00:34:47.411
So you slept with him again,

00:34:47.411 --> 00:34:49.813
and you were too embarrassed to tell us?

00:34:54.885 --> 00:34:57.154
Look at you, sneaking around
on the down low like a pro.

00:34:58.488 --> 00:34:59.456
I'm sorry.

00:35:00.424 --> 00:35:04.628
But somehow, it just felt
kind of embarrassing to bring up.

00:35:04.628 --> 00:35:07.831
What's embarrassing about that?
It's not like we're minors.

00:35:08.265 --> 00:35:11.368
Is there some law that says once you're
divorced, you can't sleep together again?

00:35:11.368 --> 00:35:13.904
Hey, keep your voice down.

00:35:13.904 --> 00:35:15.038
I said I'm embarrassed.

00:35:17.574 --> 00:35:18.642
No wonder.

00:35:18.642 --> 00:35:21.044
Your face has been all rosy lately.

00:35:21.044 --> 00:35:22.412
I thought you looked so much brighter.

00:35:23.246 --> 00:35:24.481
Now it all makes sense.

00:35:25.482 --> 00:35:26.249
So?

00:35:26.783 --> 00:35:28.719
Is your ex any good?

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.254
Hey.

00:35:31.989 --> 00:35:34.157
Once that pressure was off,

00:35:35.058 --> 00:35:36.693
we did it twice,

00:35:37.294 --> 00:35:38.462
and even three times.

00:35:41.431 --> 00:35:43.533
My goodness.

00:35:43.533 --> 00:35:46.103
At this rate, doing it all the time,
what if you end up pregnant?

00:35:46.103 --> 00:35:48.639
Can you please talk quieter, Lee Il Ri?

00:35:48.639 --> 00:35:49.439
Three times?

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:51.541
Be quiet.

00:36:00.784 --> 00:36:02.586
Are you still feeling nauseous?

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.355
What did you eat for it to sit heavily?

00:36:06.056 --> 00:36:06.923
I don't know.

00:36:08.225 --> 00:36:10.494
Seeing Il Ri in all those dresses
made me so hungry...

00:36:11.261 --> 00:36:13.530
I inhaled spicy pork
and soybean paste stew,

00:36:14.398 --> 00:36:16.400
and I've felt bloated ever since.

00:36:17.401 --> 00:36:18.635
Hold on, I'll get you a digestive.

00:36:24.174 --> 00:36:25.509
We're out of digestives.

00:36:26.276 --> 00:36:28.045
I'll run to the convenience store
and grab some.

00:36:29.246 --> 00:36:32.015
If the pharmacy's open,
buy a box of digestive medicine.

00:36:32.015 --> 00:36:33.817
If it's closed,
get a few sparkling waters.

00:36:34.217 --> 00:36:35.585
My digestion's been off
all the time lately.

00:36:35.786 --> 00:36:37.421
- Got it. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

00:36:44.761 --> 00:36:45.963
What is wrong with me these days?

00:36:47.731 --> 00:36:50.601
Every time I eat,
it sits heavily, and I feel awful.

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:55.539
My goodness.

00:36:56.139 --> 00:36:58.742
At this rate, doing it all the time,
what if you end up pregnant?

00:37:01.345 --> 00:37:03.747
If only I were that lucky.

00:37:44.288 --> 00:37:45.389
(Pregnancy Test)

00:38:10.347 --> 00:38:11.982
Honey, I got the digestive.

00:38:14.217 --> 00:38:15.118
Honey.

00:38:28.231 --> 00:38:29.166
Honey, what's wrong?

00:38:33.537 --> 00:38:34.338
Hey.

00:38:39.476 --> 00:38:41.645
What's going on?
Does it hurt too much?

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:44.381
No.

00:38:45.649 --> 00:38:47.050
It's not that.

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:47.818
Tell me.

00:38:49.353 --> 00:38:50.354
It's not that.

00:38:51.488 --> 00:38:52.889
Honey, by any chance,

00:38:53.724 --> 00:38:55.092
do you want to be a dad?

00:38:58.061 --> 00:38:58.862
What?

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:01.298
I...

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:04.201
I'm...

00:39:08.939 --> 00:39:11.074
(Pregnant)

00:39:27.658 --> 00:39:28.692
Honey.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.396
You've really been through a lot.

00:39:35.299 --> 00:39:36.433
Congratulations.

00:40:04.494 --> 00:40:06.363
Who's leaning on the doorbell like that?

00:40:06.797 --> 00:40:07.931
Who is it?

00:40:08.765 --> 00:40:11.535
You scared me.
I thought something had happened, Jin Hee.

00:40:11.535 --> 00:40:13.604
Why weren't you answering your phone?

00:40:13.604 --> 00:40:15.339
I was cleaning.
Have a seat.

00:40:15.339 --> 00:40:16.273
- Hey.
- Yeah?

00:40:16.273 --> 00:40:17.841
Are you making YouTube videos these days?

00:40:17.841 --> 00:40:19.476
How did you know?

00:40:19.476 --> 00:40:21.778
My sister texted me.

00:40:21.778 --> 00:40:24.014
She asked if the person in this video
was my friend.

00:40:24.014 --> 00:40:24.881
Hello.

00:40:24.881 --> 00:40:28.051
Subscribers of Show Must Go On,
this is Cho Na Jeong.

00:40:28.051 --> 00:40:30.220
On Show Must Go On,

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:33.223
we've launched a new segment
called "Mom Tried It Items."

00:40:33.223 --> 00:40:35.892
Among moms with little ones these days,

00:40:35.892 --> 00:40:39.263
this is getting shared around like crazy.

00:40:39.263 --> 00:40:40.364
Really?

00:40:40.364 --> 00:40:41.365
Yeah.

00:40:41.365 --> 00:40:43.834
That's wild. When I checked yesterday,

00:40:43.834 --> 00:40:46.003
it wasn't doing this well.

00:40:46.003 --> 00:40:47.070
The response is great.

00:40:48.839 --> 00:40:52.242
But look here.
I've got 815 subscribers, right?

00:40:52.242 --> 00:40:54.444
You have to pass 1,000
before you can start making money.

00:40:54.444 --> 00:40:56.280
So close.

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:59.583
Then hurry up and upload something new.

00:40:59.583 --> 00:41:01.652
You've got to strike
while the iron is hot.

00:41:01.652 --> 00:41:02.819
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:41:02.819 --> 00:41:04.321
- I should, right?
- Of course.

00:41:04.321 --> 00:41:05.255
Okay, Jin Hee.

00:41:05.255 --> 00:41:09.393
I've come up with a few follow-up ideas.

00:41:09.393 --> 00:41:10.727
- Take a look.
- Let's see.

00:41:10.727 --> 00:41:13.730
We sell a mini massager
together with an ampoule set.

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:16.166
"A face line that changes
with just one minute a day."

00:41:16.166 --> 00:41:17.334
- Something like this.
- Okay.

00:41:17.334 --> 00:41:19.236
Another one is an automatic
vibrating scalp cleaner.

00:41:20.137 --> 00:41:21.972
Jin Hee, you really need to try this.

00:41:22.406 --> 00:41:23.206
Will it make my hair grow?

00:41:23.206 --> 00:41:26.176
Yeah. This is a scalp cleaner.
It deep-cleans your scalp.

00:41:26.176 --> 00:41:27.244
I'll leave you a great review.

00:41:27.244 --> 00:41:28.078
Promise.

00:41:28.545 --> 00:41:30.047
Everyone,

00:41:30.047 --> 00:41:33.383
raising two boys,

00:41:33.383 --> 00:41:35.752
I've tried every detergent under the sun.

00:41:35.752 --> 00:41:40.123
Among them,
which detergent lifts stains the best?

00:41:40.123 --> 00:41:43.260
I'll show you through this test.

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:44.361
Look.

00:41:45.095 --> 00:41:47.130
I'm going all in.

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:48.665
My kids do this.

00:41:48.665 --> 00:41:51.401
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

00:41:51.401 --> 00:41:53.270
They come home
with stains from all of them.

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:54.905
Under the exact same conditions,

00:41:54.905 --> 00:41:57.307
I'll run the washer for 40 minutes.

00:41:58.008 --> 00:41:58.809
Look.

00:41:59.176 --> 00:42:01.378
First up is Aclean.

00:42:05.449 --> 00:42:06.450
Okay.

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:09.486
I'll show you the results
after washing under the same conditions...

00:42:09.486 --> 00:42:10.921
right away.

00:42:10.921 --> 00:42:13.423
First, Aclean. Here we go.

00:42:14.958 --> 00:42:17.861
The pen marks definitely look
a bit lighter.

00:42:17.861 --> 00:42:21.331
But the ketchup and mayonnaise stains
are still partly there.

00:42:21.331 --> 00:42:22.532
Now, next.

00:42:22.532 --> 00:42:24.301
It's going up.

00:42:24.301 --> 00:42:25.702
Yes!

00:42:27.638 --> 00:42:29.439
Keep going up.

00:42:29.439 --> 00:42:30.874
As for Lemon Plus,

00:42:30.874 --> 00:42:32.676
compared to Aclean,

00:42:32.676 --> 00:42:34.878
the mayo and ketchup look
a bit more faded, right?

00:42:35.145 --> 00:42:37.014
Go, keep rising.

00:42:45.856 --> 00:42:48.725
Making money off other people
really isn't easy.

00:42:48.725 --> 00:42:49.459
Look at this.

00:42:49.459 --> 00:42:52.062
It briefly hit 210 dollars,
then dropped back to 25.

00:42:52.062 --> 00:42:55.499
At this rate, my family
couldn't even afford one fried chicken.

00:42:55.499 --> 00:42:56.767
What am I supposed to do?

00:42:57.634 --> 00:42:59.703
Should I change up my content?

00:42:59.703 --> 00:43:02.205
Hey, just wait and see.

00:43:02.205 --> 00:43:04.107
Once you've uploaded this much content,

00:43:04.107 --> 00:43:07.177
you never know when the algorithm
will grab it and make it popular.

00:43:07.811 --> 00:43:09.446
All the moms in my neighborhood...

00:43:09.446 --> 00:43:11.415
know your channel.

00:43:11.415 --> 00:43:12.549
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:43:13.951 --> 00:43:16.453
Still, it's not easy.

00:43:16.954 --> 00:43:19.556
At this rate, I might have to get
a part-time job at a convenience store.

00:43:23.694 --> 00:43:25.529
Noh Min Jun, don't lie down.

00:43:25.529 --> 00:43:27.598
Get up. Hey, no.

00:43:27.598 --> 00:43:28.565
Get up.

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:30.801
Lock it.

00:43:30.801 --> 00:43:31.702
Okay.

00:43:36.707 --> 00:43:38.976
Min Jun, here.

00:43:41.745 --> 00:43:43.146
I had fun today.

00:43:43.146 --> 00:43:44.081
Me too, Jin Hee.

00:43:44.081 --> 00:43:45.849
Let's meet again when you're free,
and let the kids play.

00:43:45.849 --> 00:43:47.517
Yeah, let's do that.

00:43:47.517 --> 00:43:51.121
By the way, what brand is this car seat?

00:43:51.121 --> 00:43:52.222
It looks really nice.

00:43:52.222 --> 00:43:54.658
Jin Hee, this one is great.

00:43:54.658 --> 00:43:56.893
It's not a big brand.
It's from a small company,

00:43:56.893 --> 00:44:00.397
but it's way more comfortable,
and the safety is outstanding.

00:44:00.397 --> 00:44:01.698
- Really?
- Hold on.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:05.602
These kids are so wild in the car...

00:44:05.602 --> 00:44:07.938
that when it came to car seats,
I researched everything...

00:44:07.938 --> 00:44:09.473
and picked this one super carefully.

00:44:10.574 --> 00:44:11.441
- Hey.
- Yeah?

00:44:11.441 --> 00:44:13.377
Then make a video about this.

00:44:13.377 --> 00:44:15.846
- About what?
- A car seat comparison review.

00:44:16.613 --> 00:44:18.081
A car seat comparison review?

00:44:18.081 --> 00:44:19.516
This is the perfect item.

00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:22.753
That's perfect.

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.355
Thanks.

00:44:25.355 --> 00:44:26.923
I had such a great time today.
Get home safe.

00:44:26.923 --> 00:44:28.659
- You too.
- Okay.

00:44:29.293 --> 00:44:30.160
Let's go.

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.129
- Bye, Ah Young.
- Say bye.

00:44:34.331 --> 00:44:37.100
FixPro is great overall,

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:39.102
but the recline adjustment was brutal.

00:44:39.102 --> 00:44:42.239
The kids love the Guardian360,

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:45.208
but getting them out
was way too much work for me.

00:44:47.144 --> 00:44:50.647
Overall, Veec scores the highest.

00:44:50.647 --> 00:44:51.782
(Car Seat Comparison Chart)

00:44:53.784 --> 00:44:57.854
How is this tougher than home shopping?

00:45:00.557 --> 00:45:01.692
You're still working?

00:45:02.392 --> 00:45:04.027
What time is it?
Did I wake you?

00:45:04.027 --> 00:45:05.562
No, I just woke up because I was thirsty.

00:45:06.363 --> 00:45:07.497
When are you going to sleep?

00:45:07.497 --> 00:45:09.933
I'll go to bed
after I finish sorting this data.

00:45:13.503 --> 00:45:16.406
You're working harder
than when you were at the company.

00:45:17.874 --> 00:45:19.009
Is there anything I can help with?

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:21.345
I'm okay for now.

00:45:21.345 --> 00:45:24.047
If it really gets too hard,
I'll ask you for help.

00:45:24.381 --> 00:45:26.216
Okay.
Wrap it up quickly and come to bed.

00:45:26.216 --> 00:45:27.017
Okay.

00:45:32.823 --> 00:45:33.657
So...

(Car Seat Comparison Chart)

00:45:39.263 --> 00:45:40.998
Okay, then.

00:45:49.373 --> 00:45:51.742
Honey, turn off the alarm.

00:45:53.977 --> 00:45:56.847
That's yours.
I didn't set an alarm.

00:45:56.847 --> 00:45:58.815
I didn't set one either.

00:46:02.452 --> 00:46:05.422
It's yours. Turn it off.

00:46:06.723 --> 00:46:07.891
Mine?

00:46:32.249 --> 00:46:33.250
Honey.

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:34.484
Honey, look at this.

00:46:34.484 --> 00:46:35.752
What's going on?

00:46:35.752 --> 00:46:37.321
Look at this.

00:46:39.423 --> 00:46:40.390
What is this?

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:41.592
I think they're comments.

00:46:42.292 --> 00:46:44.795
Is this really your account?
Did you get hacked or something?

00:46:44.795 --> 00:46:46.063
- Hacked?
- Why is it blowing up like this?

00:46:47.664 --> 00:46:48.565
How many are there?

I'm actress Han Su Ji.

00:47:05.816 --> 00:47:06.883
- A few days ago,
- It's Han Su Ji.

00:47:06.883 --> 00:47:09.620
the car my child was riding in
was in a traffic accident,

00:47:10.253 --> 00:47:11.688
and the rescue workers told me...

00:47:11.688 --> 00:47:14.191
that my child survived
thanks to the car seat.

00:47:15.058 --> 00:47:17.094
I actually bought that car seat...

00:47:17.094 --> 00:47:19.529
after watching a review
on Show Must Go On.

00:47:20.364 --> 00:47:24.034
So I wanted to thank you from the bottom
of my heart, which is why I'm here.

00:47:24.034 --> 00:47:25.969
I saw the news and came to watch.

00:47:25.969 --> 00:47:27.904
I found out from Han Su Ji's comment.

00:47:27.904 --> 00:47:29.373
The car seat they mentioned on the news...

00:47:29.373 --> 00:47:31.842
was the one you picked
as your top choice here, so I came.

00:47:33.777 --> 00:47:37.180
A car overturned on a rainy road,

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:39.850
but the child was miraculously rescued
unharmed, and it's become big news.

00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:40.784
What?

00:47:40.784 --> 00:47:43.754
Is this that "power of the algorithm"
everyone talks about?

00:47:43.754 --> 00:47:47.190
They're saying
it's thanks to using a safe car seat.

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:48.358
At the scene of the accident...

00:47:51.194 --> 00:47:52.296
Hello?

00:47:52.296 --> 00:47:53.864

Yes, speaking. Who's this?

It's a real pleasure to meet you.

00:48:04.675 --> 00:48:07.144
I'm Kim Won Hun, CEO of Veec Car Seats.

00:48:07.744 --> 00:48:09.680
Hello, I'm Cho Na Jeong.

00:48:11.415 --> 00:48:14.217
To be honest,
we have a really good product.

00:48:14.217 --> 00:48:16.954
But our marketing budget can't compete
with the big corporations,

00:48:18.221 --> 00:48:20.424
so we had been thinking
about shutting down.

00:48:21.224 --> 00:48:24.194
But then, you posted a review
on "Mom Tried It Items,"

00:48:24.595 --> 00:48:25.963
and orders started climbing,

00:48:26.563 --> 00:48:29.166
and even Han Su Ji posted on our website,

00:48:29.633 --> 00:48:31.535
and now, the company
has completely bounced back.

00:48:32.502 --> 00:48:33.904
We're truly grateful.

00:48:34.237 --> 00:48:35.939
Not at all.

00:48:35.939 --> 00:48:39.109
All I did was recommend a good product
because it's good.

00:48:39.643 --> 00:48:40.844
I should be the one thanking you.

The reason I asked to see you today...

00:48:44.114 --> 00:48:46.583
is that thanks to all this word of mouth,

00:48:46.583 --> 00:48:49.686
we've been given the chance
to get on a home shopping channel.

00:48:49.686 --> 00:48:51.521
I see.

For that show,

as a guest.

Sweet Home Shopping?

00:49:14.044 --> 00:49:16.046
To be honest, Mr. Kim,

00:49:16.046 --> 00:49:19.850
I was on Sweet Home Shopping's
career-interrupted women's program...

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:22.653
as an intern, and got fired.

00:49:23.287 --> 00:49:25.022
I'm grateful for the offer,

00:49:25.255 --> 00:49:28.792
but I'm not sure
they'd be thrilled to have me.

00:49:29.793 --> 00:49:31.295
I see.

00:49:31.295 --> 00:49:32.062
Yes.

00:49:32.796 --> 00:49:35.866
Still, passing on someone
with this much buzz...

00:49:35.866 --> 00:49:37.100
would be a big loss for us,

00:49:37.901 --> 00:49:40.170
and I think the company
will understand as well.

00:49:42.472 --> 00:49:43.740
As long as you say yes,

00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:46.410
I'll explain things well to the company.

00:49:49.179 --> 00:49:50.013
Okay.

00:49:54.685 --> 00:49:57.487
What do you want to do, honey?

00:50:00.057 --> 00:50:01.458
I'm not sure.

00:50:01.458 --> 00:50:03.460
I'm fifty-fifty about it.

00:50:04.027 --> 00:50:06.797
Going back to home shopping
does sound good,

00:50:07.531 --> 00:50:09.533
but I'm scared I'll get hurt again.

00:50:09.533 --> 00:50:10.634
And if the results aren't good,

00:50:10.634 --> 00:50:14.137
I feel like I'd be letting down CEO Kim,
who believed in me.

00:50:14.838 --> 00:50:16.073
What do you think?

00:50:17.207 --> 00:50:18.208
Just do it.

00:50:18.976 --> 00:50:20.477
Just do it?

00:50:20.477 --> 00:50:21.411
Yeah, do it.

00:50:21.778 --> 00:50:24.247
Anyone can see this is
an amazing opportunity for your channel.

00:50:24.247 --> 00:50:25.415
There's no reason not to go.

00:50:26.516 --> 00:50:28.619
And I think it's the perfect chance...

00:50:28.619 --> 00:50:30.354
for you to really prove yourself.

00:50:31.455 --> 00:50:33.924
But if I mess up on air
and sales don't come in,

00:50:34.391 --> 00:50:37.027
it'll hurt the CEO a lot too.

00:50:37.027 --> 00:50:39.162
Why worry about that?

00:50:39.663 --> 00:50:40.697
You're Cho Na Jeong.

00:50:43.567 --> 00:50:45.102
The Cho Na Jeong I know...

00:50:45.102 --> 00:50:47.304
would never let the broadcast fail.

00:50:47.971 --> 00:50:50.107
You're the one who picked this product,

00:50:50.107 --> 00:50:51.708
and you genuinely care,

00:50:51.708 --> 00:50:54.411
and I've seen with my own eyes
how much research you put into it.

00:50:57.147 --> 00:50:58.915
You really think so?

00:50:59.416 --> 00:51:00.250
Yeah.

00:51:01.551 --> 00:51:02.586
But...

00:51:03.687 --> 00:51:05.222
why did you change so much?

00:51:05.222 --> 00:51:06.056
What do you mean?

00:51:06.456 --> 00:51:09.293
Compared to before,
you're like a completely different person.

00:51:09.793 --> 00:51:12.796
Hey, forget how I used to be.

00:51:12.796 --> 00:51:14.331
What matters is what I do from now on.

00:51:18.969 --> 00:51:20.337
"Just do it!"

00:51:38.989 --> 00:51:43.460
(Sweet Home Shopping)

00:51:45.395 --> 00:51:46.463
Hello, Executive Director.

00:51:46.997 --> 00:51:47.998
You remember me, right?

00:51:48.532 --> 00:51:51.602
I'm Cho Na Jeong, who did
the career-break return internship.

00:51:52.836 --> 00:51:53.870
Yes.

00:51:55.472 --> 00:51:56.440
We meet again.

00:51:57.541 --> 00:52:01.645
Life really does throw
some strange things at you.

00:52:01.645 --> 00:52:03.180
Because of coincidences like this,

00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:05.916
you're aiming to get a chance
to make your way back into home shopping?

00:52:05.916 --> 00:52:08.585
You're very lucky.

00:52:09.353 --> 00:52:11.855
"Lucky," Executive Director?

00:52:11.855 --> 00:52:15.125
Do you know how much I've worked
and honed my skills to get here?

00:52:15.125 --> 00:52:17.194
I'd be a bit hurt
if you brushed it off like that.

00:52:17.461 --> 00:52:19.863
If I manage to bring in sales
beyond your expectations,

00:52:20.564 --> 00:52:22.699
I'll be expecting an apology
for that comment.

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:24.835
All right.

00:52:25.702 --> 00:52:31.074
For now, just focus on boosting sales.

00:52:31.875 --> 00:52:32.976
You two can keep talking.

00:52:46.823 --> 00:52:49.393
(Veec)

00:52:52.296 --> 00:52:53.130
Na Jeong.

00:52:53.130 --> 00:52:55.899
Show them today
what you're really made of.

00:52:55.899 --> 00:52:57.234
Okay. Let's do this.

00:52:57.234 --> 00:52:58.101
Let's do this.

00:53:02.706 --> 00:53:03.874
We're live in five seconds.

00:53:04.308 --> 00:53:05.842
We're live in five seconds.

00:53:09.246 --> 00:53:10.580
(On air)

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:13.784
Hello, customers.
I'm the show host Song Ye Na.

00:53:13.784 --> 00:53:16.320
And I'm Cho Na Jeong
from "Mom Tried It Items"...

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:17.454
on YouTube.

00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:22.693
Some of you may know who I am,

00:53:22.693 --> 00:53:25.262
and some of you may not.

00:53:25.262 --> 00:53:27.431
To explain briefly,

00:53:27.431 --> 00:53:29.800
on the channel "Show Must Go On,"

00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:33.670
I produce and run
the "Mom Tried It Items" content.

00:53:34.304 --> 00:53:37.708
So why am I on home shopping today?

00:53:37.708 --> 00:53:38.909
Well,

00:53:38.909 --> 00:53:43.013
after being tested and tested and tested
on my channel,

00:53:43.013 --> 00:53:45.983
this very Veec car seat I introduced...

00:53:45.983 --> 00:53:49.453
kept a child completely safe
in a traffic accident.

00:53:49.453 --> 00:53:51.388
Those kinds of reviews...

00:53:51.388 --> 00:53:55.125
kept pouring in, so the moms went wild.

00:53:55.125 --> 00:53:56.994
I see. Let's take a look.

00:53:56.994 --> 00:53:59.963
This is the very article...

00:53:59.963 --> 00:54:01.365
that had the mom community buzzing.

00:54:01.365 --> 00:54:03.233
A child who survived unharmed
in a half-crushed car?

00:54:03.233 --> 00:54:04.735
The secret was this car seat?

00:54:04.735 --> 00:54:07.237
Show Must Go On made it all the way here.
I'm moved!

00:54:07.237 --> 00:54:08.372
Na Jeong, you're the best.

00:54:08.805 --> 00:54:10.874
The live comments are great right now.
The energy is really good.

00:54:10.874 --> 00:54:12.242
I saw that article too.

00:54:12.242 --> 00:54:13.977
Is this that car seat?

00:54:13.977 --> 00:54:16.647
If they only did baby-gear shows
like this, I'd watch every week.

00:54:16.647 --> 00:54:18.282
Honest reviews are so welcome.

00:54:18.282 --> 00:54:21.285
The response right now is incredible.

00:54:21.285 --> 00:54:23.987
Today, our customers...

00:54:23.987 --> 00:54:26.990
are giving us
a truly record-breaking response.

00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:29.793
So how many units do we have left?

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:31.461
Ten left.

00:54:32.129 --> 00:54:36.266
We've just heard
there are only about ten left.

00:54:36.266 --> 00:54:39.236
In Sweet Home Shopping's history,
in terms of car seats,

00:54:39.236 --> 00:54:42.773
it looks like we're about to set
a new record.

00:54:44.074 --> 00:54:45.108
Yes.

00:54:45.108 --> 00:54:48.912
And as we speak, the entire stock...

00:54:48.912 --> 00:54:51.148
has completely sold out.

00:54:51.148 --> 00:54:52.316
We're sold out.

00:54:52.716 --> 00:54:54.284
Everyone, thank you so much.

00:54:54.284 --> 00:54:55.352
Great work, everyone.

00:54:55.352 --> 00:54:56.353
- Great job.
- Great job.

00:54:56.353 --> 00:54:58.588
From now on as well,
we'll personally use...

00:54:58.588 --> 00:55:02.793
and thoroughly test the products ourselves
and show them to you honestly.

00:55:02.793 --> 00:55:05.495
To all the customers who joined us today,

00:55:05.495 --> 00:55:08.031
we'd like to thank you once again.

00:55:08.031 --> 00:55:10.300
Thank you.

00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:47.070
Great job today.

00:55:47.070 --> 00:55:48.205
- Thank you.
- Yes.

00:55:50.173 --> 00:55:51.375
Ms. Cho Na Jeong.

00:55:51.375 --> 00:55:52.542
Yes?

00:55:52.542 --> 00:55:55.078
You really worked hard on today's show.

00:55:55.912 --> 00:55:57.748
Number one in real-time sales.

00:55:57.748 --> 00:55:58.782
That's more than I ever expected.

00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:00.684
Thank you.

00:56:02.185 --> 00:56:05.922
So, about that comment
that I just luckily got back in.

00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:07.557
May I get an apology?

00:56:08.025 --> 00:56:09.726
You're right.

00:56:09.726 --> 00:56:11.695
I should be apologizing.

00:56:12.796 --> 00:56:13.664
Yes.

00:56:15.198 --> 00:56:16.466
Wait, Ms. Cho.

00:56:17.634 --> 00:56:18.502
Yes?

00:56:18.502 --> 00:56:21.371
Watching you today,

00:56:21.371 --> 00:56:23.273
I felt your talent as a show host...

00:56:23.941 --> 00:56:26.109
is truly exceptional.

00:56:26.877 --> 00:56:29.913
Would you, by any chance,
consider coming back...

00:56:30.981 --> 00:56:31.815
to Sweet Home Shopping?

00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:35.285
To Sweet Home Shopping?

00:56:36.253 --> 00:56:39.189
I want to enjoy my work
and also live fully as a mom.

00:56:39.523 --> 00:56:41.158
For me, Sweet Home Shopping...

00:56:42.292 --> 00:56:43.827
hasn't exactly been all that sweet.

00:56:46.763 --> 00:56:48.165
I see.

00:56:48.165 --> 00:56:50.601
Well, that's a shame,
but it is what it is.

00:56:51.602 --> 00:56:55.005
Still, you can keep collaborating with us
on follow-up projects, right?

00:56:55.772 --> 00:56:57.040
Of course.

00:57:09.586 --> 00:57:13.523
(1 year later)

00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:18.328
You're up early.

00:57:18.328 --> 00:57:19.162
Yeah.

00:57:24.701 --> 00:57:26.536
Is it Na Jeong's birthday?

00:57:26.536 --> 00:57:27.371
Yeah.

00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:36.580
Happy 42nd birthday, Cho Na Jeong.

00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:37.748
Did you have your seaweed soup?

00:57:38.148 --> 00:57:40.617
I don't know.
I'm not sure I'll have time.

00:57:40.617 --> 00:57:41.685
I'm running late for an interview.

00:57:44.054 --> 00:57:46.723
Honey, I've got an interview today,
so I'll head out first.

00:57:46.723 --> 00:57:48.692
- Father, I'll be back.
- All right, go on.

00:57:48.692 --> 00:57:51.728
Min Woo, Min Jun, go to kindergarten
with Grandpa and be good.

00:57:51.728 --> 00:57:52.829
Okay.

00:57:52.829 --> 00:57:55.065
Honey, wait.

00:57:55.065 --> 00:57:56.733
Here, at least have one spoon
of seaweed soup before you go.

00:57:57.234 --> 00:57:58.302
It's hot.

00:58:01.805 --> 00:58:02.873
It's really good.

00:58:02.873 --> 00:58:04.007
- Yeah?
- I'll come home early.

00:58:04.007 --> 00:58:05.275
Happy birthday, honey.

00:58:05.275 --> 00:58:06.109
Thanks.

00:58:07.945 --> 00:58:09.112
See you later.

00:58:09.112 --> 00:58:10.013
Yeah.

00:58:24.361 --> 00:58:27.097
Naraeng, happy birthday.

00:58:27.998 --> 00:58:30.300
I'm still so jealous that you're busy.

00:58:35.439 --> 00:58:36.773
Oh Jae In.

00:58:39.409 --> 00:58:41.945
Are you really not going to sleep?

00:58:42.679 --> 00:58:44.982
When are you ever going to sleep?

00:58:44.982 --> 00:58:48.452
Why is your day and night
completely flipped?

00:58:48.452 --> 00:58:50.721
Honey, sorry.

00:58:51.521 --> 00:58:52.990
I couldn't get up again.

00:58:54.424 --> 00:58:56.727
Come here and take the baby.

00:58:58.028 --> 00:58:59.363
Hang on, okay.

00:59:01.531 --> 00:59:02.399
Come here.

00:59:15.846 --> 00:59:16.780
Did you have your food?

00:59:18.048 --> 00:59:18.882
Yeah?

00:59:20.851 --> 00:59:22.619
- You're hungry, aren't you?
- Yeah.

00:59:22.619 --> 00:59:23.553
I'll make breakfast.

00:59:29.426 --> 00:59:31.828
We should definitely meet up today,
don't we?

00:59:32.863 --> 00:59:33.797
Naraeng.

00:59:33.797 --> 00:59:35.699
You'll need to spend dinner
with your family,

00:59:35.699 --> 00:59:37.434
so let's have a nice lunch out.

00:59:38.835 --> 00:59:39.770
How about here?

00:59:40.704 --> 00:59:42.372
That looks great.

00:59:42.372 --> 00:59:43.974
Gu Joo Young, can you come?

00:59:43.974 --> 00:59:45.042
Yeah.

00:59:45.042 --> 00:59:47.210
Our babysitter's coming today,

00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:48.378
so I think I can go out.

00:59:48.879 --> 00:59:49.713
Deal.

00:59:50.013 --> 00:59:51.281
Then noon, here.

00:59:51.615 --> 00:59:52.549
Na Jeong,

00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:55.018
I hope you have the happiest day
in the whole world today.

00:59:59.957 --> 01:00:01.391
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

01:00:02.559 --> 01:00:03.427
Okay.

01:00:24.014 --> 01:00:27.017
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:00:27.017 --> 01:00:28.185
We're here for the interview.

01:00:28.185 --> 01:00:30.354
- I see.
- I'm so nervous.

01:00:30.354 --> 01:00:31.622
Thank you so much.

01:00:31.622 --> 01:00:32.889
- I'm such a fan.
- You're so beautiful.

01:00:32.889 --> 01:00:33.957
Thank you.

01:00:33.957 --> 01:00:34.891
Good luck, everyone.

01:00:34.891 --> 01:00:36.193
- Thank you.
- Sure.

01:00:38.095 --> 01:00:40.097
- You're so pretty.
- Your show is so beautiful.

01:00:45.302 --> 01:00:48.705
Happy birthday.

01:00:48.705 --> 01:00:49.773
Thank you.

01:00:50.307 --> 01:00:52.643
When did you prepare all this?

01:00:54.111 --> 01:00:55.979
But, anyway,

01:00:55.979 --> 01:00:58.348
there are way more applicants
than I expected.

01:00:58.348 --> 01:00:59.216
Exactly.

01:00:59.216 --> 01:01:00.684
We narrowed it down as much as we could,

01:01:00.684 --> 01:01:02.653
but I guess there are a lot of moms
who want to work.

01:01:02.653 --> 01:01:03.954
Yeah, I see.

01:01:04.688 --> 01:01:07.357
Do you think it'll be past 12 p.m.
by the time the last interview is over?

01:01:07.357 --> 01:01:10.260
Not sure.
If we move fast, it'll wrap up quickly,

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:12.029
but I can't promise it'll be before noon.

01:01:12.596 --> 01:01:14.431
CEO Cho, could you approve this?

01:01:14.431 --> 01:01:15.265
What?

01:01:16.166 --> 01:01:18.035
How about this for the next review?

01:01:18.035 --> 01:01:19.136
Let's see.

01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:21.738
- Take a look at this.
- Yeah.

01:01:22.906 --> 01:01:25.409
I tested it beforehand.

01:01:25.409 --> 01:01:26.243
Yeah?

01:01:26.877 --> 01:01:30.047
From application to finish,
it feels really nice.

01:01:30.047 --> 01:01:31.882
Then I should try it too.

01:01:31.882 --> 01:01:33.116
Jin Hee, can you get me a sample?

01:01:33.116 --> 01:01:33.951
Okay.

01:01:33.951 --> 01:01:35.385
- Thanks.
- Okay.

01:01:39.289 --> 01:01:43.727
(CEO Cho Na Jeong)

01:01:52.736 --> 01:01:54.805
Guys, a lot of applicants showed up.

01:01:54.805 --> 01:01:56.340
So noon seems impossible.

01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:57.574
Should we push it back a bit?

01:01:57.574 --> 01:02:00.310
(Editor-in-Chief's Office)

01:02:00.544 --> 01:02:01.545
Hey, Choi Woo Ram.

01:02:03.313 --> 01:02:04.781
Why does the cover shoot look like this?

01:02:05.449 --> 01:02:09.019
We shot outside that day,
and the weather was bad,

01:02:09.019 --> 01:02:10.354
so the light quality wasn't great.

01:02:10.354 --> 01:02:12.122
If the weather's bad, you move the date,

01:02:12.122 --> 01:02:14.758
or change the concept.
You should've done something.

01:02:14.758 --> 01:02:17.027
The fact that you thought of bringing this
to me for approval...

01:02:17.027 --> 01:02:17.928
does not even make sense.

01:02:18.462 --> 01:02:20.564
Within the next two hours,

01:02:20.564 --> 01:02:23.000
we're changing the concept
and redoing the entire layout.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.736
Woo Ram, contact the actor
and check their schedule.

01:02:25.736 --> 01:02:28.138
If they can't,
tell them we'll replace them.

01:02:28.138 --> 01:02:29.373
And apologize.

01:02:29.373 --> 01:02:31.174
Hye Jeong, back up Woo Ram.

01:02:31.174 --> 01:02:34.144
Rebook everything
from the shoot, makeup, and wardrobe.

01:02:34.144 --> 01:02:37.047
Once the concept is reset,
come straight to my office.

01:02:37.047 --> 01:02:37.948
Yes.

01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:45.922
(Editor-in-Chief Lee Il Ri)

01:02:48.325 --> 01:02:49.426
Sorry, guys.

01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:52.029
The cover shoot fell through,
so one o'clock's not happening.

01:02:52.896 --> 01:02:53.764
How about two?

01:02:58.135 --> 01:02:59.536
Oh Jae In.

01:03:00.637 --> 01:03:02.439
Go to sleep.

01:03:04.074 --> 01:03:05.275
If you're sleepy, you should sleep.

01:03:05.275 --> 01:03:08.445
Why are you torturing me
instead of sleeping?

01:03:16.687 --> 01:03:17.821
Yes, ma'am?

01:03:19.690 --> 01:03:20.791
Yes.

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:24.595
Sorry?

01:03:29.433 --> 01:03:30.734
Yes, okay.

01:03:31.668 --> 01:03:32.636
It can't be helped.

01:03:35.105 --> 01:03:36.173
All right, bye.

01:03:41.144 --> 01:03:42.779
Okay.

01:03:42.779 --> 01:03:44.848
Yeah.

01:03:45.682 --> 01:03:48.318
I'll call the other sitters. It's okay.

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.121
Guys, I'm sorry.

01:03:51.722 --> 01:03:53.957
I don't think I can go out today.

01:03:55.158 --> 01:03:56.994
The sitter says she can't make it.

01:03:58.128 --> 01:04:04.334
All done.

01:04:05.402 --> 01:04:07.938
It's fine.
It's not like today's the only day.

01:04:08.171 --> 01:04:09.673
Let's just meet on the weekend instead.

01:04:10.107 --> 01:04:11.508
Is the birthday what matters most?

01:04:11.508 --> 01:04:13.110
Seeing you guys is what matters most.

01:04:13.543 --> 01:04:14.578
Yeah.

01:04:15.178 --> 01:04:17.781
A weekend when Sang Min's off
would be even better.

01:04:18.248 --> 01:04:20.884
Then how about making it a family outing?

01:04:21.818 --> 01:04:22.786
Sounds great.

01:04:22.786 --> 01:04:24.621
- The barbecue place near my place?
- Yeah.

01:04:24.621 --> 01:04:26.823
We can relax, have some wine,
and grill some meat.

01:04:26.823 --> 01:04:29.159
That sounds great.

01:04:29.159 --> 01:04:30.394
First time in a while
I get some fresh air.

01:04:31.161 --> 01:04:34.531
No matter what,
we're meeting this weekend.

01:04:34.531 --> 01:04:35.499
Okay?

01:04:35.499 --> 01:04:36.600
IlNaYoung.

01:04:41.672 --> 01:04:42.906
- Thank you for the food.
- Looks delicious.

01:04:42.906 --> 01:04:43.807
Thanks.

01:04:44.408 --> 01:04:45.275
My sweet husband.

01:04:46.643 --> 01:04:47.644
Yeah.

01:04:48.078 --> 01:04:49.446
Right.

01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:52.582
The kids are really having fun.

01:04:52.582 --> 01:04:54.484
- Right? They're so excited.
- Yeah.

01:04:54.484 --> 01:04:55.852
He's really grown.

01:04:55.852 --> 01:04:56.887
Right?

01:04:56.887 --> 01:04:58.588
But these days, he really doesn't listen.

01:04:59.323 --> 01:05:00.190
He takes after his mom.

01:05:02.659 --> 01:05:03.660
Honey.

01:05:06.396 --> 01:05:08.665
How long has it been
since we've had free time like this?

01:05:10.267 --> 01:05:12.936
These days, I don't even know
how the days go by.

01:05:12.936 --> 01:05:14.705
I don't have a second to breathe.

01:05:15.205 --> 01:05:18.575
Honestly, once I became the owner,
I thought it'd be a bit easier.

01:05:19.142 --> 01:05:22.379
But there's not a single thing
I can take my hands off.

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:25.849
I'm completely overwhelmed too.

01:05:26.483 --> 01:05:29.252
I had no idea raising a kid
would be this hardcore.

01:05:29.786 --> 01:05:32.222
I just wish I could flop down flat...

01:05:32.222 --> 01:05:34.524
and sleep straight through.

01:05:34.524 --> 01:05:36.994
- Right?
- Well, look at you two.

01:05:36.994 --> 01:05:38.629
You guys have completely...

01:05:38.629 --> 01:05:40.864
changed your minds.

01:05:40.864 --> 01:05:41.932
Hey, Cho Naraeng.

01:05:41.932 --> 01:05:43.200
When you first started your company,

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:46.303
you were a wreck worrying what you'd do
if there weren't any clients.

01:05:46.303 --> 01:05:47.204
And you, Gu Joo Young.

01:05:47.204 --> 01:05:50.407
You were worried sick,
saying you might never get pregnant.

01:05:51.441 --> 01:05:52.876
Exactly.

01:05:52.876 --> 01:05:54.211
That's so true.

01:05:59.716 --> 01:06:00.717
But,

01:06:02.319 --> 01:06:03.687
strangely enough,

01:06:04.788 --> 01:06:07.190
it feels like we're each
making things happen...

01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:08.692
little by little, doesn't it?

01:06:12.229 --> 01:06:15.065
You have your daughter, Jae In.

01:06:17.501 --> 01:06:19.703
You have Sang Gyu.

01:06:20.904 --> 01:06:21.872
And...

01:06:23.974 --> 01:06:26.276
I have my work and my family.

01:06:26.276 --> 01:06:27.678
Incredible.

01:06:28.278 --> 01:06:29.212
You're right.

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:37.587
Yes.

01:06:38.322 --> 01:06:40.824
Life is sometimes a series of hardships,

01:06:40.824 --> 01:06:42.392
but even in those days,

01:06:42.392 --> 01:06:44.628
because we were with
these precious people,

01:06:45.095 --> 01:06:46.463
it could still be beautiful.

01:06:52.169 --> 01:06:53.203
Your food is here.

01:06:54.037 --> 01:06:57.107
Looks delicious.
Who made this?

01:06:57.107 --> 01:06:58.375
Honey, come here for a second.

01:06:58.375 --> 01:06:59.209
Okay.

01:06:59.676 --> 01:07:01.178
- Go on.
- This looks appetizing.

01:07:04.214 --> 01:07:05.148
Don't open your eyes yet.

01:07:05.148 --> 01:07:07.317
Why, what is it?

01:07:07.317 --> 01:07:08.218
Just one more step forward.

01:07:09.086 --> 01:07:10.287
It's nothing big.

01:07:10.287 --> 01:07:11.254
Ta-da.

01:07:12.489 --> 01:07:13.624
What's this?

01:07:13.624 --> 01:07:16.393
We never even got proper rings
when we got married.

01:07:27.904 --> 01:07:28.839
Honey.

01:07:29.506 --> 01:07:32.309
I was going to give it to you
right on your birthday,

01:07:32.309 --> 01:07:34.111
but it took a while to get the size right.

01:07:34.111 --> 01:07:34.945
I'm sorry.

01:07:36.313 --> 01:07:37.481
I'm so moved.

01:07:38.382 --> 01:07:39.383
Do you like it?

01:07:40.884 --> 01:07:41.985
Of course, I do.

01:07:42.686 --> 01:07:44.488
A hundred, a thousand times more
than the apron.

01:07:45.088 --> 01:07:46.456
Let's forget about that one.

01:07:50.994 --> 01:07:53.997
You know I'm always on your side, right?

01:07:55.799 --> 01:07:57.601
The best thing I ever did in my life...

01:07:58.302 --> 01:07:59.636
was marrying you.

01:08:03.774 --> 01:08:04.641
Me too.

01:08:07.544 --> 01:08:08.612
You put it on me.

01:08:19.289 --> 01:08:20.958
It's so beautiful. Thank you.

01:08:20.958 --> 01:08:21.625
Don't mention it.

01:08:23.894 --> 01:08:25.162
I'll put yours on for you.

01:08:35.439 --> 01:08:36.573
It looks perfect on you.

01:08:39.576 --> 01:08:40.711
Sorry it took so long.

01:08:42.112 --> 01:08:42.946
It's okay.

01:08:52.356 --> 01:08:54.858
Hurry up, Cho Naraeng.
The wax is dripping.

01:08:55.392 --> 01:08:58.128
My birthday's already gone.
What's with the cake?

01:08:58.128 --> 01:09:00.163
We couldn't just let it pass.

01:09:00.163 --> 01:09:02.966
Of course not.
You've got to cut a birthday cake.

01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:04.868
Thank you, everyone.

01:09:05.168 --> 01:09:07.304
Blow them out.
Make a wish first.

01:09:14.911 --> 01:09:17.714
Let's all be happy every single day.

01:09:18.081 --> 01:09:19.950
One, two, three.

01:09:21.718 --> 01:09:24.855
I'll throw my arms around my life
with everything I've got.

01:09:29.426 --> 01:09:31.228
Because there is no next life.

01:10:28.652 --> 01:10:30.787
(Don't call me ma'am)

01:11:11.995 --> 01:11:13.997
