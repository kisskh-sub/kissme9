[Silent Tides]

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.940
[Episode 11]

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.229
Chief,

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.160
how did it go?

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.720
Is the contract signed yet?

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.080
What?

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.509
Citizens of Macau,

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.780
I am Governor De Solaire.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.740
Over the past two months,

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.210
Macau has undergone
unprecedented challenges.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.070
Hundreds of thousands of Macau citizens
and visitors have experienced

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.830
an unimaginable famine and plague,

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.780
even the loss of loved ones,

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.360
and other indescribable suffering.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.160
Fortunately, through the concerted efforts
of the General Chamber of Commerce,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.079
charitable organizations,
and caring individuals,

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.360
especially the valiant Chinese people

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.670
who made sacrifices,

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.150
food supplies
have finally arrived in Macau today.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.290
The famine in Macau is over!

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.870
Huang Gongjie...

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.170
Let's go!

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.900
Heinous traitor,

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.710
look at you, pulling a long face.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.710
You're not even allowed
to lick the Japanese's boots.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.550
What a wretched lapdog he is!

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.460
What are you up to?

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.710
You're in Macau,

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.210
where laws are in place.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.140
Are you going to trample on the law?

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.829
Captain Huang,

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.980
I left you a present
in the northwest corner

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.240
of the warehouse.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.460
Don't forget to go get it.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.120
Guys,

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.850
let's go celebrate with drinks.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.210
Let's go!

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.579
-Let's go!
-Go.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.340
Get the drinks flowing!

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:04.950
Hey, Master Sanhe.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.290
Master Sanhe, hear me out.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.890
Give me a chance

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:07.360
to...

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.360
Xian?

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:10.670
Captain Huang?

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.390
You finally came.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.810
I almost lost my life.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.760
Rong told you last night

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.170
that he wouldn't escort the ships?

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.090
Rong said he had something to do.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.290
What else could I say?

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.700
Did you carefully review

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.620
the shipping documents?

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:43.800
Of course I did.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.430
Since Rong wasn't there,

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.700
to be on the safe side,

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.670
I conducted the check
with Magistrate Zhao.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.790
Only after he personally confirmed
everything was in order

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.930
did I give him the payment and his cut.

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:57.909
Why did Zhao Dinghua

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.860
issue a transit permit
for Modaomen Waterway?

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.120
I felt reluctant at that time,

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.050
being worried that the detour
might cause delays.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.290
But Magistrate Zhao said

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.910
Hengmen Waterway had been blocked,

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.640
so the ships had to return
via Modaomen Waterway.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.480
What happened next?

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.950
Next,
the ships went for Modaomen Waterway.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.670
Because of the sudden route change,

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.170
the Japanese officer at the checkpoint

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.780
called Magistrate Zhao.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.200
The latter confirmed
everything was fine himself.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.290
Only then were we allowed to pass through.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.320
What happened after that?

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.500
After that,

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.300
the ships passed the checkpoint,

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.970
and I was suddenly covered with a sack.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.620
I was beaten savagely
without even knowing why.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.200
Finally, the assailants told me

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.120
they were from Tai Ho Brotherhood,

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.450
and that the grain heist

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.550
was their way to teach you a lesson,

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.240
Mr. Huang.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.120
To teach me a lesson?

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.090
You were in the grip
of Tai Ho Brotherhood.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.780
Could they have easily
let you off the hook?

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.200
Let me off the hook?

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.260
That guy called Master Huang dragged me
to the edge of the ship,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.800
threatening to throw me into the sea
to feed the fish.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.460
Luckily,
Master Sanhe told him to spare my life,

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.590
so I could deliver

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:05.850
a message for them.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.090
A message?

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.480
What message?

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.670
Well...

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:13.790
Say it.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.100
Captain Huang,

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.260
please don't take offense.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:21.670
Master Sanhe said

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.170
this grain heist

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.200
was just a minor lesson for you,

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.550
and that one day
he'd stab you multiple times

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.910
and present your blood
as a sacrificial offering

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.440
to some dead man named Fifth Master,

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.620
so you'd realize the consequences

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.050
of leaving the brotherhood for the enemy

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.180
and becoming a traitor to the country.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.650
Here's the reply from Zhongshan:

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.700
Zhao Dinghua is nowhere to be found.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.240
A local search for him is underway.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.760
Let's head to Zhongshan.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:55.409
Yes.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.820
Leader,

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:02.730
Gambler Rong has come back to Macau.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:06.190
The moment he arrived at the pier,
Fearless Biao took him away.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.470
Chang,

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:08.360
don't worry.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.240
I've prepared a boat.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.910
If an emergency comes up,

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.200
I'll immediately evacuate you

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.290
and Xian's family from Macau.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.360
Master Sanhe,

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:20.950
I'm not worried about myself.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.070
I'm worried about Xian.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.360
Mr. Huang,

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.610
I really am telling the truth.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.500
Alright. Let me sum up your statement.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.380
You met a logjam at about 11 a.m.
in Hengmen.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.790
The waterway was blocked.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.409
You were stuck there for some time,

00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:41.930
and finally reached Zhongshan Pier
after 3 p.m.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.650
only to find the grain ships had left.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:44.680
Is that correct?

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.000
Yes.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.770
According to our plan,

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.440
you were supposed
to set off with the ships at 5 a.m.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.300
and pass through Hengmen Waterway
at a bit past 8.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.909
How did that logjam get in your way at 11?

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.380
The departure was postponed

00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:59.740
by something.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:00.990
By what?

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.530
Well,

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:04.730
I...

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.430
I can't hear you. Speak up!

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.790
I arrived at the pier at 5 a.m. and found

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.360
the transit permit had gone missing.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.150
Lyun Coeng insisted
that I complete the full procedure,

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.350
which resulted in...

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:19.170
a delay of several hours.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:20.880
You lost the transit permit too?

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.670
Where did you lose it?

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:22.740
I have no idea.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.240
Where did you go
after attaining the permit?

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.290
Nowhere!

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:26.320
I went home to sleep.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.650
Did you not tell He Xian
that you wouldn't escort the ships?

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:29.850
No, I didn't say that!

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:31.370
I... received this essential task
from you.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.570
How could I have bailed on it, Mr. Huang?

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:39.539
Then what happened?

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.600
Then, I tried to call Magistrate Zhao,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.700
but couldn't get through.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:43.840
I got to the county government
only to find him gone

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.930
with an envoy of the Special Higher Police
from Guangzhou.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:48.220
He was nowhere to be found.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.080
Mr. Huang, I rushed back to inform you

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.680
once I realized the grain
had gone missing.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.630
Is it the whole story?

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.390
Yes.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:55.320
Then how did your hand get injured?

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.600
An accident happened.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.480
An accident?

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:58.790
Let me see it.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.980
Oh, Mr. Huang.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.320
Mr. Huang!

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.910
An entire finger was cut off
in an accident?

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:08.030
Explain

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.700
what kind of accident that was!

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.560
Don't get me started. It was just...

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.170
I hung a knife on the wall.

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.290
It fell...

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.440
and cut my finger.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.050
They've been talking for some time.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.740
I wonder how it's going.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.000
Was Rong with the ships or...

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.830
Mr. Huang.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.580
Biao,

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.450
go to all casinos to find out

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.900
if Rong was in any of them yesterday.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.430
Qiu, search Rong's home.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.210
You're suspicious of Rong?

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.290
He Xian and Rong told different stories.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:55.490
Who should I believe?

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.800
He Xian's story makes sense,

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.410
while Rong's doesn't add up.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:09:59.200
Without a thorough investigation,

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.670
how will I explain to Agency Chief Sawa?

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:01.270
Off you go.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:02.320
Yes.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.770
Mommy, when are we moving?

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:34.600
We'll move when Daddy comes back.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.970
But when exactly will Daddy come back?

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.000
Be patient.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.580
Daddy will be back soon.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.130
Yes.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.210
Very soon.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:44.910
He'll be back very soon.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.290
The Special Higher Police in Guangzhou

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:00.890
denied sending anyone here.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:02.700
That envoy must be

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.630
someone from the AJGF in disguise.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.650
Besides,
Zhao Dinghua's stash of money is gone.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.910
It indicates that he fled with his money,

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.770
but unfortunately encountered the AJGF
on his way.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:17.960
Bastards,
did anyone allow you to take photos?

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:19.650
Take the film out of their cameras now.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.820
Do not let a word out
about Zhao Dinghua's murder!

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:22.480
Don't move!

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.200
No photos!

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:23.820
Bastards!

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:24.700
-Put your cameras away!
-Put your cameras away!

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.550
Lieutenant Sawa, it's too late.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:31.790
Too late?

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:34.800
What do you mean?

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.460
Last night,

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.800
the AJGF already executed Magistrate Zhao.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.550
Flyers about it have reached every corner
in Zhongshan County.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.010
Everyone has got the news.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:45.750
Reporters from multiple newspapers

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.440
arrived at the scene before us.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.040
There's no way to conceal this matter
anymore.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.570
Extra! Extra!
Give me one.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:56.630
Okay.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:01.080
Magistrate of Zhongshan County,
Zhao Dinghua, fled with funds!

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:01.840
Here you are.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.130
He was shot to death by
Commander Ou of Wugui Mountain AJGF!

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.050
Extra! Extra!

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:09.100
Magistrate of Zhongshan County,

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.700
Zhao Dinghua, fled with funds!

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.960
He was shot to death by
Commander Ou of Wugui Mountain AJGF!

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.700
Extra! Extra!

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:17.620
Great!

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.220
Commander Ou is amazing.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.650
I knew Zhao wouldn't have

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.680
told the Japanese on Modaomen Waterway

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.840
that he filled out the transit permit
wrong.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.820
With Zhao Dinghua's death,

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.010
the only variable is gone.

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.010
Xian can extricate himself easily.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.380
As people say,
things will always work themselves out.

Please take a seat.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:16.070
May I ask what brings you here?

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:18.020
Answer the phone first.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:23.370
Hello.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.250
This is Zhao Dinghua.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:36.460
Wanqi,

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.860
it's time to add pressure
to Huang Gongjie.

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:49.670
Hello.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:51.560
This is Mr. Ma.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.740
It's time
the two of you made an appearance.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:55.440
[A body was found in Shimen Town,

Now,

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:13.170
only the two of you are left
to confront each other.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:13.890
Mr. Huang...

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:14.700
Sit down!

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.390
It's very obvious.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:21.960
It was exactly He Xian

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.430
who took our grain in collusion
with Tai Ho Brotherhood

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.230
and Magistrate Zhao, Mr. Huang.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:31.480
Why that smirk?

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:35.980
You claim I said
that I wouldn't escort the ships.

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.290
When did I ever say it?

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:38.510
Where did I say it?

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:42.820
I found you suspicious at the first place,

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.060
so I kept telling Mr. Huang

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.410
that you were definitely up to something.

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:46.960
See? I was right, wasn't I?

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.630
Tell me,

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.550
who else but you would've done it?

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:52.080
Captain Huang, you see Rong as a brother.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.340
I'm sure you believe everything he says.

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.480
There's nothing I can say
to change your mind.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.170
Why not just shoot me dead?

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.620
Did I say I'd believe him over you?

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:04.170
Just speak your mind.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.560
I can judge for myself

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.020
who's loyal and who's not.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.370
Fine.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.170
Then, Rong, I'd like to ask you

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:13.170
three questions.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:15.650
First,

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.670
for helping Captain Huang
cash out his deposits,

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.670
Tai Ho Brotherhood regards me
as a thorn in their side.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.100
How would I have possibly
colluded with them?

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.790
How would I have possibly
teamed up with them?

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.250
Second,

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:30.980
I never had any dealings
with Magistrate Zhao.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.670
How was it possible for me
to concoct

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:34.600
such an elaborate scheme with him?

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:35.100
Well...

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:35.910
Third,

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:39.010
you had that transit permit
the entire time.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:39.750
How could I have

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.750
possibly given it to Tai Ho Brotherhood?

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:42.250
Huh?

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:46.880
He's asking you.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:52.870
I don't know!

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.060
It must be you.

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.920
I'm sure you planned for all that!

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:57.600
Captain Huang will determine

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.370
who planned for all that.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.370
Whether I've betrayed you

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:02.700
and should be killed or not—

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:03.560
Captain Huang,

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:04.910
it's your call.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:17.940
Mr. Huang,

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.530
are you seriously suspecting me?

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.700
-Mr. Huang.
-Mr. Huang.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.630
We got a finding.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.750
Say it out loud then.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.060
Rong

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.390
gambled at Hou Heng till midnight
the day before yesterday.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:39.650
Did you?

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:43.700
Mr. Huang,

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.440
I couldn't resist

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.670
the urge to gamble.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:47.530
I won't gamble anymore,

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:48.170
Mr. Huang.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.060
I really am innocent
of all that happened afterwards.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:51.930
For switching to your side,

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:53.820
Tai Ho Brotherhood has labeled me
a traitor who deserves to die.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.050
By no means

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:57.380
would I have got involved with them again!

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.340
Qiu, don't you think so?

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.720
Are you really innocent, Rong?

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.900
Care to explain what this is?

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.760
Mr. Huang, we found this at his place.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.750
[Oath by Chen Jiarong]

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.280
Mr. Huang...

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.170
I was wondering

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.700
how that transit permit

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.780
ended up in Huang Sanhe's hands.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.570
It was all your doing,
you backstabbing hunk of junk!

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:34.170
Mr. Huang!

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:35.830
Mr. Huang,

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:37.840
I can explain this blood oath.

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:38.930
That day...

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.560
I lost a lot of money, Mr. Huang.

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.090
Huang Sanhe forced me

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:45.810
to write this damn thing,

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:47.570
or he wouldn't set me free, Mr. Huang!

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:49.830
I... I was just lying to them.

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:51.020
None of this means anything!

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:51.570
Mr. Huang, I...

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.180
A blood oath doesn't mean anything.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.870
What can be a more solemn vow than that?

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:56.940
Mr. Huang!

00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:58.520
No!

00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.980
I really didn't betray you!

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:01.740
I would never ever betray you!

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.410
I really, really didn't betray you.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:04.280
I really didn't.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.700
Mr. Huang,
we got a call from Agency Chief Sawa.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.260
He has arrived at Gongbei Port.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.280
He'd like to see you in his office
in an hour

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.370
to hear the investigation results.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:12.630
He sounded very angry.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.000
Mr. Huang, take me with you.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:20.940
I'll explain to him.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.980
I'll tell him the fault is all mine,

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:23.940
and that you're innocent.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.780
Mr. Huang, I'll take the blame, okay?

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.040
I'll take the blame.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.110
After smearing my name,

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:30.780
now you're looking to smear

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.940
Captain Huang's name in the Imperial Army?

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:33.740
Rong,

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.540
all Captain Huang did
was charge higher prices

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:36.870
for the grain
without telling the Imperial Army.

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:38.260
He did give you a share of the profits.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:39.320
How can you do this?

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.570
Do you have to frame your captain
so as to survive?

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.670
You're talking nonsense! Nonsense!

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:44.870
That's not what I mean.

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:46.200
Mr. Huang, please believe me.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.720
I would never betray you.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.280
Mr. Huang, he's slandering...

00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.870
Rong...

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:02.780
may you rest in peace.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:35.410
Mr. Huang,

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:36.680
two men downstairs

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.590
looking all pompous

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:38.790
are asking to see you.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:42.170
Who are they?

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:43.540
One is surnamed Fu,

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:44.610
and the other Cui.

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:46.810
They say they're here to collect a debt.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:04.520
Is he really sick

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.830
or just avoiding us?

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.540
Mr. Fu, don't get it wrong.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.260
Captain Huang is genuinely sick.

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.740
Besides,
you signed that contract with He Xian.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.410
You should ask him for a refund instead.

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:15.260
Enough!

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:17.610
Everyone knows

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:19.720
the grain from Zhongshan was seized
by Captain Huang.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.590
He Xian is just a middleman.

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.370
Now, the goods haven't been delivered,

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:24.760
and He Xian has disappeared.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.330
We have to talk to Captain Huang,

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:28.460
the real seller of the goods, don't we?

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.910
Please have some tea and calm down.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.810
Anyway, go and tell Huang Gongjie

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.450
that he must return the money today.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:38.660
The court will

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.740
definitely deem
the consignment he signed in person

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:42.930
valid.

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:43.480
Goodbye.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.480
Oh, Mr. Fu!

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:45.610
Mr. Fu,

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:46.830
please don't be mad.

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:08.410
Brother Xian,

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.980
since you were the one who engaged

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:12.720
Fu and Cui in this deal,

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:16.020
I may have to trouble you
to clean up the mess.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.040
They're demanding a refund now.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.700
What can I possibly give them?

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.100
Can't you see what's happening?

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.110
Tai Ho Brotherhood stole the grain

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:27.410
for the General Chamber of Commerce.

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:28.930
Do you believe

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.740
the brotherhood and the chamber

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:31.970
aren't in cahoots?

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.570
Be that as it may,

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:35.940
what can I do

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:36.810
if they deny it?

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.570
Then I'll have to
bring everyone down with me.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.170
What do you mean?

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:47.150
If this whole thing blows up,

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:50.970
I'll have some others
take the fall with me.

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:52.940
This is what I'll say—

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:54.520
this crafty plot

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.740
was orchestrated by Rong,

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:01.570
Cui, Fu, and Tai Ho Brotherhood.

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:03.940
Let's see

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:07.720
how the Japanese will deal with them.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:13.770
We'll have to take a shot then.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.210
Now, I'll go talk to Fu and Cui

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:17.610
about what's at stake

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:19.600
and try to put an end to all this.

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:21.170
However,

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:23.610
we must give that promissory note
back to them.

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:24.740
Let's consider it this way—

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.440
the general chamber just spent 6 million

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.300
on 10 million kilograms of grain.

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:29.390
It's not a bad deal.

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:34.520
Okay.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.220
Besides the contract,

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.230
make sure
you bring the consignment I signed

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:41.020
back to me.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.670
Please.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.000
I understand.

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:50.640
[Hou Heng Casino]

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.980
How did it go?

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:01.200
I begged and begged.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.400
This is finally done.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.570
Hurry.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.660
To the Sawa Agency.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:11.700
Xian,

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:13.370
while we're on the way,

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:14.830
let me tell you two things.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:16.030
Do memorize my words.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:17.630
What are they?

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:18.410
First,

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:20.370
I sold the grain to you

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:22.560
at 12 avos per kilogram.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.070
When you meet Lieutenant Sawa,

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.250
don't say it wrong.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:26.440
Got it.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.780
The second thing is even more important.

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:29.740
This whole mess

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:32.780
was simply caused
by the magistrate of Zhongshan County,

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.870
Zhao Dinghua, and Tai Ho Brotherhood

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:36.020
in collusion.

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.830
The Special Ops was not involved at all.

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:39.200
As for Rong,

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.330
I executed him because he lost

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.910
the transit permit.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:47.930
But Gambler Rong was the one
colluding with Tai Ho Brotherhood.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:49.610
Xian, in this matter,

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:51.630
Rong cannot be connected
to Tai Ho Brotherhood

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:53.000
in any way.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:56.230
Captain Huang, are you saying

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:59.070
that the Special Ops was negligent,

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.610
but never had a mole?

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.040
That's right.

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.570
When we talk to Agency Chief Sawa later,

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:05.780
shift all the blame

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.330
to Zhao Dinghua.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:08.910
Tell the chief you just did the legwork,

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:10.370
and that you know nothing.

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:12.280
I'll take care of the rest.

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:14.740
Okay. I got it.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.140
Where is my consignment of grain sales?

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:27.170
Isn't it along with the contract?

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:28.780
No. Look.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.070
See for yourself.

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.070
I remember taking it
from Mr. Fu and Mr. Cui.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.680
Perhaps I accidentally left it somewhere.

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.240
Xian,

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.610
what do you mean by this?

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.570
Nothing.

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:45.030
Captain Huang,

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.650
isn't Agency Chief Sawa
still waiting for us?

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:50.040
I need to testify for you first, don't I?

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.310
As for the consignment,

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:55.030
I ensure you
I will carefully search for it.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:57.130
But as you know, the more one rushes,

00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:58.700
the harder it is to find an item.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:24:59.780
If one stays patient,

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.670
maybe someday,

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:02.470
that item will pop up somewhere.

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:09.040
Impressive.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.610
You're good, Brother Xian.

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:15.460
Just make sure it doesn't pop up

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.030
where it shouldn't be.

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:19.330
Rest assured.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.060
As long as I am safe and sound,

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:23.410
the consignment

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:25.680
won't appear where it shouldn't be.

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:38.860
Do you know...

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.240
who on earth killed Zhao Dinghua?

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:46.340
I have no idea at all.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.390
I don't know

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:49.120
what exactly happened either.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.830
Chief, please believe me.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.760
It never occurred to me

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.960
that Zhao Dinghua

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:56.130
would collude with Tai Ho Brotherhood.

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:57.180
Besides, I did only charge 12 avos

00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.590
for each kilogram of grain.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:02.110
This is Empresa Commercial Lyun Coeng's
fright manifest for this week.

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:03.370
And this is...

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:04.630
Chief.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.570
About Gambler Rong,

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.570
I shot him dead with my own hands.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.030
He was like a brother to me.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:11.280
But h-he was too...

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:14.980
Who did it?

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:16.000
I really don't know.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:16.770
Who did it?

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:18.370
Who did it?

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:20.310
This is...

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:21.570
the shipping receipt.

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:24.610
The cargo declaration.

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:25.480
These are...

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:29.180
Shipping receipts
from the trading company.

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:41.030
Here are the statements
of the persons involved...

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:42.870
for your review.

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:47.830
What's the point?

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:51.560
They're all trying to steer clear.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.540
How did Zhao Dinghua die?

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:56.070
Why would the Communist Party's AJGF

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.460
in Zhongshan suddenly show up?

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:00.200
And that Gambler Rong...

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.370
He got executed for failing a task?

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:06.520
What exactly is Huang Gongjie hiding?

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:10.830
Ten million kilograms of grain
were stolen for sale.

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:14.150
And a dead man
is the one and only person to blame.

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:16.420
Could that be possible?

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.170
Go on with the investigation!

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:22.460
Find out the truth.
Leave no leniency for the culprit!

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:28.280
What?

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:31.910
I just sent you a telegram about the plans

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:33.760
for the grain shipped to Macau.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.280
Yes, got it.

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:37.000
General...

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:41.590
Don't cause any trouble
before you're promoted to colonel.

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:45.000
Follow the instructions in the telegram.

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:48.270
Yes.

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:53.010
I will act on your guidance, General.

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:01.670
Mr. He,

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:04.530
Agency Chief Sawa requests your presence.

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:40.090
Mr. He.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:45.670
Read through this interview record.

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.130
Sign it if you find it correct.

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:55.370
Is it the record of my interview?

00:28:58.980 --> 00:28:59.700
Why?

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:03.760
Can't you remember what you just said?

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:07.590
It's okay.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.500
Let me sum it up for you.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.840
As a compassionate response

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.260
to the hardships faced by Macau,

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.570
the Japanese Imperial Army

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:22.500
specially authorized you, Mr. He,
to procure grain from Zhongshan

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.760
on behalf of

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.960
the Macau General Chamber of Commerce.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:26.960
Mr. He,

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:30.130
you then successfully
brought grain to Macau,

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:32.350
and thus saved hundreds of

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.130
thousands of starving people.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.000
Mr. He,

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:39.240
the above is your truthful statement.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.240
The Imperial Army
has confirmed its authenticity.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.000
Do you...

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.220
have any problems with it?

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:53.430
I have no problem

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:55.030
with this interview record.

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:56.130
I'll sign it now.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:56.850
Good.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:58.930
Sign it then.

Daddy!

Daddy!

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:48.040
You're finally back.

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:48.870
Does it hurt?

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:50.480
I'm fine.

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:53.540
It's all that matters.

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:40.610
What do you think, Baixin?

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:41.810
Not bad. It looks good.

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:42.770
Let's go eat.

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:43.670
Kids,

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:44.390
time to have dinner.

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:45.440
-Okay.
-Yes.

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:49.370
Hurry up.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:50.870
Here we come.

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:51.650
Miss Qiao.

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:52.020
Yes.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.200
Alright.

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:56.740
Come on, time for dinner.

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:58.390
Mrs. He, you're such a great cook.

00:33:58.390 --> 00:33:59.760
Look what a feast you've made.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.370
Mrs. He, what soup is it?

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:03.740
Pork bone soup with watercress,
dried tangerine pill, and carrots.

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.180
It's perfect for this season,

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.280
as it's good for the throat and lungs.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.390
I must learn to make it then.

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:08.750
Wanqi has been coughing a lot lately.

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:10.000
He needs to have more of this soup.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.120
Mrs. He, teach me later, will you?

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:11.940
Sure.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.060
Come on, sweetie,
have some soup before you eat.

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:14.790
Here you go.

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:16.409
Now,

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:18.960
Let us all celebrate together—

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.219
the He family on moving

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:22.639
into their beautiful new home.

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:24.020
May them have prosperity,

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.480
many more new descendants,

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.540
and everlasting success in business.

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:26.909
Cheers!

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:27.330
Sure!

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:28.440
Cheers!

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:31.239

Nice wine.

Here, sir.

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:44.120
Xian,

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:46.120
we're not just here

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:49.020
for this housewarming party.

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:50.810
Xian.

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:54.540
Let me fill your cup.

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:56.239
Thank you.

00:34:58.730 --> 00:34:59.440
Dr. Ke.

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:04.660
Xian...

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.720
The banking industry

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:08.640
in Macau used to be

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.640
dominated by BNU.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:11.980
Although Chinese merchants
also operated banks,

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:13.430
they all worked independently

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:15.140
and couldn't make a real difference.

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:15.800
Therefore,

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:18.330
after consultations,
some Chinese merchants have agreed

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:19.290
to partner with us

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:20.650
to establish Macau's

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:23.410
first joint-venture bank
founded on Chinese capital.

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:24.610
called Tai Fung Bank,

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:27.010
located on Avenida de Almeida Ribeiro,

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:29.870
next to Macau's future financial exchange.

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:33.140
Xian,

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:34.690
apart from

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:36.750
attending this housewarming party,

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:38.120
the shareholders

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:39.870
also gave me an important task.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:44.920
Xian, please invest in the bank

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:47.520
and take the position of general manager.

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:48.520
Me?

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:49.870
No, no.

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:50.660
Mr. Ma,

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:51.920
how is it appropriate?

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:55.190
You ran banks before.

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.830
Given your competence,

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:57.370
how is it not an appropriate proposal?

00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:59.510
Perfect. It's the perfect job for you.

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:00.870
This is terrific.

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:02.270
I'll drink to that first.

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:04.480
Xian,

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.590
I also think you're most suited for it.

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:09.710
We all hope
you can be an investor of Tai Fung Bank.

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:11.560
Let's reshape
the financial landscape of Macau.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:12.830
That's right, Xian.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.050
But right now,

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:17.370
I can't offer much money,

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:19.560
and I haven't gathered enough experience.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:20.620
I'm far from being qualified

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:22.210
for the position of general manager.

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:22.870
Why not

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:24.310
let me work as a regular clerk?

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:24.560
No.

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:25.020
Xian...

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:25.790
I promise

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:27.190
I'll do my absolute best.

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:28.460
What do you

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:29.210
think?

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:30.830
Look, Wanqi,

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:32.020
what matters

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:33.880
is that Xian has agreed to join us.

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.290
Let's leave his specific role

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:37.290
in the bank for future discussions.

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:38.520
Okay.

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:40.440
It's settled then, Xian.

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.250
Welcome onboard.

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:44.290

Congratulations.

Come on.

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:57.710
Help yourself to the food.

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:59.660
Mrs. He, a toast to you.

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.160
Thank you all.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.420

Oh right, Miss Qiao...

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:13.980
Mr. He,

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:16.120
would you stop calling me

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:17.210
Miss Qiao?

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:18.870
I have a name.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.770
Just call me Yinwan.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:23.250
Okay.

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:26.060
Then stop calling me Mr. He too.

Yinwan,

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:35.580
I've heard
that you're going be a music teacher

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:36.940
at Kiang Wu Elementary School.

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:37.370
Yes.

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.390
Previously, when I took Yu there

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:41.520
for enrollment,

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:43.930
I noticed
that the school needed a music teacher.

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:45.960
So I decided to try applying for the job.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.120
That way, I can spend more time with Yu.

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:50.790
When will you start working there?

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:52.250

a dormitory for me.

once I finish moving.

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.250
Qiwen and I will come help

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:01.510
and visit Yu then.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:02.800
Sounds great.

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:04.310
Let's stop here.

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:05.440
This is where I live.

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:08.290
Go in then. I'll take off.

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:09.160
Okay.

Come on.

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:26.560
Take a seat.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.290
Zhengping,

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:36.160
what's there to transport this time?

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:36.960
How can I help?

00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:38.230
It's not that.

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:39.500
I came here

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:40.910
to thank you in person

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:42.650
for lending me a helping hand.

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:44.940
Don't mention it.

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.250
Dr. Ke is a good friend of mine,

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:48.580
and you're his brother.

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.120
It was my pleasure to help.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:53.620
Thank you.

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:00.500
I also want to express gratitude to you
on behalf of those

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.500
who have received the supplies, Mr. Ma.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.030
As a token

00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:04.210
of appreciation,

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:05.790
allow me to toast you with tea

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:06.720
instead of wine.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.330
Zhengping,

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:11.050
if you're serious about this,

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:12.720
let's go for the real stuff.

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:15.440
Mr. Ma,

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.850
I'll drink up to show respect.

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:17.790
Zhengping,

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.410
though it's been a short time
since we met,

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:21.140
after seeing what you've done,

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:23.850
I, Ma Wanqi,
have considered you a true friend.

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.580
-Cheers.
-Being friends with you

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:27.180
is a true honor for me, Mr. Ma.

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:28.670
This is to you, Zhengping.

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:36.890
Any plans for the future, Zhengping?

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:38.140
I'll go back to Hong Kong

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.200
to run my pharmacy.

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:41.500
I know I shouldn't be nosy

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:42.970
about certain things.

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:44.370
But I do think

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:48.960
you can follow Mr. Lu Xun's example,

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.160
who abandoned medicine for literature.

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.020
You can switch from medicine to business.

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:54.830
Business?

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.020
I'm just an ordinary pharmacist.

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:00.610
Why should I do business?

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:02.530
Perhaps you can save more people

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:03.690
in a new role.

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:08.080
You'd love to save lives,

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:10.480
while I have connections in business.

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:13.160
Mr. Ma, you're saying...

00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:15.630
That we can be partners

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:17.270
and do business openly.

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:23.350
Zhengping,

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:25.420
give some

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.500
serious thinking to my advice.

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:28.600
Today,

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:30.590
let's get drunk.

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:32.360
Let's get drunk.

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:32.890
Cheers.

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:37.350
Xian, have some tea.

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:39.500
Why the formalities?

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:42.000
Just a gesture of gratitude.

00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:43.750
If it hadn't been for your reminder,

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:44.960
I would have got in serious trouble

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.160
during the previous shipping of grain.

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:48.790
You were safe at last
because you're meticulous

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:50.020
and adherent to the rules.

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.940
No one could catch you
doing anything wrong.

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:54.440
Still, it all thanks to your warnings
beforehand.

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.890
Otherwise,
those in Sawa Agency might hold Lyun Coeng

00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:58.250
accountable for the theft of the grain

00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:59.250
from Zhongshan,

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:00.850
and I wouldn't be able
to prove my innocence.

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:01.520
So,

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:04.190
I must thank you, Xian.

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:11.100
Xian,

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:14.770
I have a question,
but I'm not sure if I should ask it.

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:16.410
Ask away.

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:18.690
When the transit permit was issued,

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:19.460
you asked me

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:21.810
what would happen if it went missing.

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:24.620
It did go missing in the end—
was it a coincidence,

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:26.550
or did you just foresee the future?

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:30.830
Hongshen,

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.790
you once said to me

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:34.870
that though you're of mixed heritage

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:37.560
the He family regard
where your great-grandmother came from,

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.140
namely Bao'an, Guangdong,
as your ancestral home.

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:41.460
In other words,

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:42.830
the He family,

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:44.870
including you, He Hongshen,

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.060
are all Chinese.

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.710
Yes.

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:54.790
I ran off the topic.

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:55.480
Sorry.

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:57.690
What were you asking just now?

00:41:57.690 --> 00:41:58.750
I've forgotten it.

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:03.980
So have I.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.000
I have such a poor memory.

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:07.370
The matter was just over,

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:09.100
and I've already put it behind.

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:10.160
Anyway,

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.910
hundreds of thousands of people
in Macau have been saved.

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:14.110
That's what matters.

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:45.460
Mr. Huang, anything wrong?

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:47.080
I think I just saw

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.830
the foreign girl
who tipped off the British army.

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:51.520
How come she's gone so fast?

00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:56.770
Wait.
