Hey, Top!

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:42.345
What's gotten into you,

00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:45.625
calling me to your place at this hour?

00:00:47.025 --> 00:00:48.225
I'm just going to put it here.

00:00:49.425 --> 00:00:50.625
It's been a while.

00:00:51.345 --> 00:00:52.345
I just want to talk to you.

00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:54.265
You're home alone?

00:00:56.905 --> 00:00:57.905
Whoa.

00:00:58.385 --> 00:00:59.785
My family's overseas.

Whoa!

00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:06.105
So, you called me over for a party?

00:01:06.745 --> 00:01:07.665
Sure!

00:01:07.705 --> 00:01:09.145
Let me get the stuff
from your dad's room.

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:10.505
This will make this night go smoothly.

00:01:10.545 --> 00:01:11.545
We can do that later.

00:01:16.825 --> 00:01:17.665
Come here.

00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:18.825
Let's have a chat.

00:01:19.465 --> 00:01:20.465
Are you okay?

00:01:21.365 --> 00:01:22.385
Anything wrong?

00:01:22.425 --> 00:01:23.425
You look a bit serious.

00:01:25.825 --> 00:01:27.385
Beam, how long have we been friends?

00:01:28.785 --> 00:01:30.025
Over ten years, I think.

00:01:30.065 --> 00:01:30.945
What about it?

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:34.745
16 years.

00:01:35.425 --> 00:01:36.425
Yeah, 16 years.

00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:37.625
D*mn it.

00:01:41.425 --> 00:01:42.625
And do you think

00:01:43.085 --> 00:01:46.505
there's anything you haven't told me?

00:01:48.065 --> 00:01:49.265
What do you mean?

00:01:50.945 --> 00:01:53.385
- Sheesh!
- What?

00:01:53.425 --> 00:01:55.425
- What's up with you?
- I've got something to show you.

00:01:57.825 --> 00:01:58.825
Let me see.

00:02:08.225 --> 00:02:10.025
- Sh*t!
- Hey.

00:02:10.545 --> 00:02:11.465
Sit tight, okay?

00:02:12.025 --> 00:02:13.105
It's about to reach the climax.

00:02:41.265 --> 00:02:42.145
Sh*t!

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:48.745
You bribed the bar owner
to delete the footage,

00:02:48.985 --> 00:02:51.305
but I f*cking recovered it.

00:02:51.345 --> 00:02:53.345
I didn't know it was your girlfriend's.

00:02:53.385 --> 00:02:54.705
You knew everything from the start,

00:02:54.745 --> 00:02:56.465
but you just kept
your f*cking mouth shut!

00:02:56.505 --> 00:02:58.585
At that time, I didn't know what to do.

00:02:58.985 --> 00:02:59.745
I didn't think it through.

00:02:59.785 --> 00:03:01.145
Of course, you f*cking did!

00:03:01.465 --> 00:03:03.505
You wanted to save yourself

00:03:03.545 --> 00:03:05.505
and let my girlfriend suffer instead!

00:03:14.625 --> 00:03:16.345
How can you do this to me?

00:03:18.385 --> 00:03:19.985
How can you do this to Bell?!

00:03:20.265 --> 00:03:21.865
How dare you get her thrown in jail?

00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:31.025
You're my friend, remember?

00:03:31.625 --> 00:03:32.625
F*cking b*stard!

00:03:47.625 --> 00:03:49.625
Wasn't it you

00:03:51.025 --> 00:03:52.025
who gave me the drugs?

00:03:57.825 --> 00:03:58.945
Go and confess, d*mn it.

00:04:00.385 --> 00:04:02.505
I think everything's gotten

00:04:03.505 --> 00:04:05.145
too out of hand already.

00:04:06.905 --> 00:04:08.105
What if I refuse?

00:04:10.865 --> 00:04:12.345
I'll submit the footage
to the authorities.

00:04:18.965 --> 00:04:19.965
So...

00:04:21.165 --> 00:04:22.505
I, your dear friend,

00:04:24.225 --> 00:04:25.505
have to take the blame, right?

00:04:30.385 --> 00:04:32.265
You got Bell arrested.

00:04:34.665 --> 00:04:37.065
I'm just doing the right thing

00:04:37.105 --> 00:04:38.105
to save her.

00:04:40.065 --> 00:04:41.785
You didn't want to save her, really.

00:04:44.865 --> 00:04:46.945
You just want to save yourself.

00:06:56.185 --> 00:06:58.065
Come on, focus on your work, people.

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:02.305
You're done early,
you'll get to clock out early.

00:07:27.745 --> 00:07:28.665
What do you want?

00:07:29.145 --> 00:07:31.025
We want to apologize to you.

00:07:32.345 --> 00:07:34.145
Now, we've cut ties with Kae.

00:07:36.345 --> 00:07:37.865
Didn't she...

00:07:37.905 --> 00:07:39.785
kick you out?

00:07:41.025 --> 00:07:43.785
She gave our cut
to Mathusorn and Karakade

00:07:43.825 --> 00:07:44.825
and

00:07:45.425 --> 00:07:47.145
took all of our underlings.

00:07:49.465 --> 00:07:51.265
My cut was already small,

00:07:51.625 --> 00:07:52.825
and she still gave it to them.

00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:01.145
As soon as you hit a wall,

00:08:02.225 --> 00:08:03.825
you came crawling back to me,

00:08:05.545 --> 00:08:06.265
huh?!

00:08:10.465 --> 00:08:12.585
Still, I always give in to you.

00:08:17.185 --> 00:08:17.905
Ow!

00:08:18.945 --> 00:08:19.785
D*mn you, girls.

00:08:19.825 --> 00:08:20.585
Gosh!

00:08:24.625 --> 00:08:25.425
Gosh...

00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:28.265
You're getting sick because of our hug?

00:08:29.745 --> 00:08:31.745
It's indigestion. It'll go away soon.

00:08:33.385 --> 00:08:35.265
What are you gonna do about Kae?

00:08:35.305 --> 00:08:36.305
You're gonna let her go?

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:40.585
She's messing with 3Ds.

00:08:41.425 --> 00:08:42.625
We won't let her go so easily.

00:08:47.105 --> 00:08:48.185
Why are you smiling?

00:08:49.665 --> 00:08:50.865
Are you even sorry?

00:08:56.825 --> 00:08:57.905
Capybara.

00:09:01.385 --> 00:09:02.785
Where has Capybara gone?

00:09:06.265 --> 00:09:07.145
Meow!

00:09:09.225 --> 00:09:10.225
Not this kitten.

00:09:11.105 --> 00:09:12.345
Capybara.

Come and enjoy your meal.

00:09:15.705 --> 00:09:17.625
Your mommy's got a ton of debt.

00:09:17.825 --> 00:09:20.225
I don't know
if we can afford your next meal.

00:09:27.465 --> 00:09:28.465
I'm sorry.

00:09:30.905 --> 00:09:32.505
Don't be.

00:09:34.585 --> 00:09:36.065
Just having the roses bloom...

00:09:36.745 --> 00:09:37.985
is enough to make me happy.

00:09:39.925 --> 00:09:42.145
You don't actually have to help me
pay off my debt, you know?

00:09:43.705 --> 00:09:44.705
I have to.

00:09:45.225 --> 00:09:47.425
We grew the roses together,

00:09:48.465 --> 00:09:50.465
so we have to help each other
pay for the fertilizer.

00:09:51.425 --> 00:09:52.825
How are we supposed to
get all of the money?

00:09:55.625 --> 00:09:56.865
There's only one way.

00:09:57.425 --> 00:09:58.425
What is it?

00:10:01.165 --> 00:10:03.325
We have to work.

00:10:04.625 --> 00:10:05.385
Right?

00:10:22.985 --> 00:10:23.785
Huh?

00:10:28.625 --> 00:10:29.625
What do you want?

00:10:34.465 --> 00:10:35.665
I'm looking for work.

00:10:36.505 --> 00:10:37.385
Work?

00:10:38.705 --> 00:10:40.225
Well, others are doing it.

00:10:40.505 --> 00:10:41.505
It's nothing weird, right?

00:10:46.225 --> 00:10:48.225
Go and grab any available seat, then.

00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:21.985
She's been working nonstop.

00:11:23.945 --> 00:11:25.225
Her pile of paper is huge!

00:11:25.505 --> 00:11:26.745
I've been working for so long,

00:11:27.065 --> 00:11:28.615
yet I haven't come even close to her!

00:11:28.639 --> 00:11:30.439
How upsetting.

00:11:41.625 --> 00:11:43.305
I'm good. Feeling a bit lightheaded.

00:11:46.785 --> 00:11:47.625
Alright.

00:11:48.345 --> 00:11:49.265
That's it for today.

00:11:49.305 --> 00:11:50.385
Continue your work tomorrow.

You're staying here or what?

Come back here tomorrow, okay?

00:12:01.905 --> 00:12:02.785
Sign it!

Hey.

00:12:12.625 --> 00:12:14.225
That's enough. We've reached the quota.

00:12:15.105 --> 00:12:16.305
There's no overtime pay?

00:12:17.265 --> 00:12:18.185
Overtime pay?

00:12:18.225 --> 00:12:19.105
We don't pay overtime!

00:12:20.585 --> 00:12:22.225
The more I work,
the more I'll get paid, no?

00:12:23.345 --> 00:12:24.265
You're messing with me?

00:12:25.465 --> 00:12:26.985
Just showing up already gets you paid.

00:12:27.025 --> 00:12:28.345
It doesn't matter how hard you work.

00:12:30.425 --> 00:12:31.625
That sounds so unfair.

00:12:31.945 --> 00:12:33.545
The harder we work,
the more we should be paid.

[KaiHuaRor]

00:12:48.985 --> 00:12:49.985
Are you alright?

00:12:52.385 --> 00:12:53.385
Good morning.

00:13:00.265 --> 00:13:01.625
How are you doing, honey?

00:13:01.665 --> 00:13:02.865
Are you exhausted from work?

00:13:03.645 --> 00:13:04.785
I'm so worn out.

00:13:04.825 --> 00:13:06.785
I was folding the paper all morning.

00:13:07.605 --> 00:13:09.625
You can actually work here, you know?

00:13:10.825 --> 00:13:12.185
I'm working here by myself.

00:13:13.425 --> 00:13:14.425
The job's easy, too.

00:13:16.205 --> 00:13:17.805
The wages are a bit low, though.

00:13:23.585 --> 00:13:24.585
Double the bet!

00:13:24.705 --> 00:13:26.285
- Hey, did you cheat?!
- Hey.

00:13:26.465 --> 00:13:27.585
Gosh, I'm so upset.

00:13:27.625 --> 00:13:28.705
- What the hell?!
- Bell.

How many times have you won?

00:13:32.265 --> 00:13:34.765
When I was little,
I played Pok Deng with my dad every day.

00:13:36.025 --> 00:13:37.025
I was pretty good at it, too.

00:13:38.065 --> 00:13:38.985
Want me to show you?

00:13:39.425 --> 00:13:40.585
Please, don't.

00:13:42.065 --> 00:13:43.185
We should work hard, you know?

00:13:45.105 --> 00:13:46.305
It's a shortcut to wealth.

00:13:47.185 --> 00:13:48.305
It's not a good one.

00:13:50.385 --> 00:13:51.545
Do you want me to

00:13:51.585 --> 00:13:53.185
quit and work with you?

00:13:53.825 --> 00:13:54.945
This way, we'd earn more.

00:13:56.705 --> 00:13:57.705
No, it's okay.

00:13:57.865 --> 00:13:58.945
You'd be too worn out.

00:14:00.265 --> 00:14:01.345
If we don't have enough money,

00:14:01.385 --> 00:14:02.505
I'll sell one of my kidneys.

Are you crazy?

I'm serious.

Why are you so slow?

Look at these two newcomers.

They're outperforming you. Come on.

00:15:27.745 --> 00:15:28.665
Don't just stare.

00:15:28.705 --> 00:15:29.705
Work harder, d*mn it!

00:15:37.345 --> 00:15:39.905
Gosh, one newcomer
is already bad enough.

00:15:40.545 --> 00:15:41.705
Now, there are two of them.

00:15:41.985 --> 00:15:43.185
They're making it worse for us.

00:15:43.305 --> 00:15:44.585
Someone should tell them

00:15:44.625 --> 00:15:47.105
that nobody earns more
just by working harder.

00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:51.465
She did so much work
on her first day, too.

00:15:52.945 --> 00:15:53.945
Quit gossiping.

00:15:53.985 --> 00:15:55.185
I told you to work!

00:15:55.905 --> 00:15:57.065
We're sorry, Dao.

00:15:57.105 --> 00:15:58.265
We're sorry.

00:15:58.905 --> 00:15:59.985
We're so sorry, Dao.

00:16:15.545 --> 00:16:18.705
[Work hard]

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.545
I've gone overboard this time.

00:16:28.385 --> 00:16:29.505
Go and sell these.

00:16:30.745 --> 00:16:31.745
They'll sure be overjoyed.

00:16:32.985 --> 00:16:34.185
Thank you so much, my friend.

00:16:35.705 --> 00:16:36.905
Don't forget it, okay?

00:16:57.685 --> 00:16:59.625
There are a lot of supplies this time.

00:17:03.945 --> 00:17:04.945
Here's a box of art toys.

00:17:04.985 --> 00:17:06.185
Give it to your kid.

00:17:06.905 --> 00:17:08.385
I've got five kids.

00:17:17.185 --> 00:17:17.985
There.

00:17:27.825 --> 00:17:28.825
Thank you.

00:17:47.185 --> 00:17:48.065
Where are you going?

00:17:49.905 --> 00:17:51.505
I'm asking where you're going.

00:17:56.385 --> 00:17:58.625
Your order hasn't arrived, Dao.

00:17:58.665 --> 00:18:00.065
You'll get yours on the next delivery.

00:18:00.265 --> 00:18:01.585
We knew it

00:18:01.825 --> 00:18:03.025
'cause we didn't order anything.

00:18:04.505 --> 00:18:06.785
Is there anything you want from me?

00:18:07.285 --> 00:18:08.285
Nothing much, really.

00:18:09.145 --> 00:18:10.785
I'm not waiting for the next delivery.

00:18:10.825 --> 00:18:12.025
I want the ones from today.

00:18:12.265 --> 00:18:13.185
But...

00:18:13.225 --> 00:18:15.265
These goodies have their owners.

00:18:15.385 --> 00:18:17.265
You can't just come and take them.

00:18:17.665 --> 00:18:18.825
I want them.

00:18:18.865 --> 00:18:20.025
So what?

00:18:23.065 --> 00:18:24.065
Deedee...

00:18:24.785 --> 00:18:27.385
Talk to your sister.

00:18:28.825 --> 00:18:31.025
Kae is gonna be mad if she finds out.

00:18:31.345 --> 00:18:32.505
So what?

00:18:32.685 --> 00:18:34.205
You're scared of her?

00:18:34.545 --> 00:18:36.345
We're going to take all of her goods.

00:18:36.745 --> 00:18:38.065
Then, we'll see
what she'll do about it.

00:18:38.545 --> 00:18:40.265
We'll beat you up if you do.

00:18:45.665 --> 00:18:46.985
These are all valuable goods.

00:18:47.425 --> 00:18:50.625
You think I'm dumb enough
to let her carry them alone

00:18:51.215 --> 00:18:53.415
so you can steal from us?

00:18:54.425 --> 00:18:56.465
I've always had my people
watching her.

00:18:57.865 --> 00:18:58.625
Hey!

00:19:00.025 --> 00:19:01.225
Back off.

00:19:01.745 --> 00:19:03.465
Deedee, stop.

00:19:06.985 --> 00:19:09.025
Having these girls at my disposal
is so convenient.

00:19:09.785 --> 00:19:10.985
I get you now.

00:19:12.305 --> 00:19:13.705
I guess...

00:19:14.745 --> 00:19:16.865
I'll let you go this time.

00:19:18.125 --> 00:19:20.725
Next time, if you dare cross me again,

00:19:21.785 --> 00:19:23.065
I won't be so kind.

00:19:27.425 --> 00:19:28.425
Dao?

00:19:32.465 --> 00:19:33.985
Dao, you're looking a bit sick.

00:19:35.305 --> 00:19:36.625
Do you have an allergy?

00:19:42.545 --> 00:19:44.185
Do you need my antihistamines?

00:19:45.905 --> 00:19:49.425
But it seems like you always
order yours from Mangpor monthly.

00:19:52.865 --> 00:19:53.865
Don't you?

00:20:01.625 --> 00:20:02.505
Let's go.

00:20:16.345 --> 00:20:17.265
We'll deal with you later!

00:20:48.745 --> 00:20:49.625
Kae!

00:20:54.185 --> 00:20:55.345
What the f*ck have you done?

00:20:58.185 --> 00:20:59.305
Well, I've done a lot of things.

00:20:59.645 --> 00:21:00.785
Which one are you referring to?

00:21:01.425 --> 00:21:02.825
What did you do to my medicine?

00:21:03.865 --> 00:21:05.425
Oh...

00:21:05.945 --> 00:21:07.105
Your birth control pills?

00:21:07.985 --> 00:21:09.865
I swapped it for my antihistamines.

00:21:10.625 --> 00:21:11.785
I thought they were the same thing.

00:21:12.905 --> 00:21:14.465
Why the f*ck did you do that?!

00:21:14.505 --> 00:21:15.505
F*cking why?!

00:21:18.905 --> 00:21:20.225
That's a good question, really.

00:21:21.385 --> 00:21:22.585
Why did I do it?

00:21:25.065 --> 00:21:26.665
When you were in power,

00:21:27.265 --> 00:21:29.265
you treated us like sh*t.

00:21:30.425 --> 00:21:32.305
You abused Wichai's power

00:21:32.345 --> 00:21:33.745
to control all of us

00:21:34.385 --> 00:21:37.685
so that we had to do your bidding.

00:21:38.905 --> 00:21:40.145
Do you know

00:21:40.185 --> 00:21:42.145
how resentful I've become?

00:21:42.665 --> 00:21:44.465
But I couldn't do
a f*cking thing about it.

00:21:47.865 --> 00:21:49.945
I have to thank your sister, Deedee,

00:21:50.905 --> 00:21:53.305
for letting me grow
somewhat in power.

00:21:54.345 --> 00:21:56.145
And I've actually done it.

00:22:00.145 --> 00:22:01.745
The problem is,

00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:05.185
as long as you and Wichai
are still around,

00:22:06.665 --> 00:22:09.465
I can't be in full control.

00:22:10.825 --> 00:22:13.025
Is there a way

00:22:13.825 --> 00:22:18.225
I can get rid of both of you
at the same time?

00:22:19.625 --> 00:22:21.185
Then I got an idea.

00:22:21.665 --> 00:22:23.905
If the head female inmate

00:22:24.185 --> 00:22:26.435
got pregnant by the warden,

00:22:27.185 --> 00:22:28.865
you two would definitely
be in deep sh*t.

00:22:28.905 --> 00:22:30.465
You b*tch. I'll f*cking kill you!

00:22:30.505 --> 00:22:31.505
I'll kill you!

00:22:32.505 --> 00:22:33.505
I'll destroy you!

00:22:40.545 --> 00:22:41.545
Dao.

00:22:42.485 --> 00:22:43.885
Calm down.

00:22:44.665 --> 00:22:46.665
You're pregnant, aren't you?

00:22:56.145 --> 00:22:57.585
I think from this point on,

00:22:57.625 --> 00:22:59.945
you'd better think about
what you're gonna do next.

00:23:01.825 --> 00:23:04.225
You only have about
7-8 months left don't you?

00:23:11.905 --> 00:23:12.785
Let me go!

00:23:12.945 --> 00:23:13.745
Hands off!

00:23:15.985 --> 00:23:17.185
- Dao...
- F*ck off!

00:23:27.985 --> 00:23:29.345
How much have we made?

00:23:30.385 --> 00:23:31.385
Um...

00:23:31.865 --> 00:23:33.265
I think
we've already made over half.

00:23:33.505 --> 00:23:34.345
Why did you ask me that?

00:23:35.705 --> 00:23:36.985
All we've done is work.

00:23:37.465 --> 00:23:38.865
We haven't had time
for sweet moments.

00:23:43.145 --> 00:23:44.865
But we share
the same cell, don't we?

00:23:46.225 --> 00:23:47.785
It's not like that!

00:23:47.965 --> 00:23:49.385
I mean...

00:23:49.425 --> 00:23:52.065
Having a chat
or doing things together.

00:23:52.525 --> 00:23:53.825
Mm.

00:23:54.445 --> 00:23:55.445
Well...

00:23:57.225 --> 00:23:59.185
Once we've got enough money,

00:24:00.545 --> 00:24:01.665
should we quit the job?

00:24:05.465 --> 00:24:07.465
Do we have to inform anybody first?

00:24:08.745 --> 00:24:09.905
I think it's Dao.

00:24:13.785 --> 00:24:14.985
Where has she gone, though?

00:24:16.065 --> 00:24:17.185
We haven't seen her in days.

00:24:19.905 --> 00:24:21.105
I don't know either.

00:24:52.985 --> 00:24:54.625
I'll deal with Kae.

00:24:57.505 --> 00:24:58.705
What's the plan?

00:24:58.745 --> 00:24:59.625
I'm up for this.

00:25:01.305 --> 00:25:02.225
Dao.

00:25:02.265 --> 00:25:03.345
Are you good?

00:25:04.345 --> 00:25:06.305
You've been sick
for a few days now.

00:25:07.985 --> 00:25:08.905
I'm fine.

00:25:09.765 --> 00:25:11.005
You're not pregnant, are you?

00:25:16.385 --> 00:25:17.785
Maybe you just ate too much.

00:25:24.545 --> 00:25:26.345
Go and tell Kae

00:25:28.745 --> 00:25:30.545
that I've agreed with Wichai

00:25:31.785 --> 00:25:34.065
to let her be in charge of everything
instead of us,

00:25:34.105 --> 00:25:36.305
in exchange for us
being her business partners.

00:25:37.905 --> 00:25:40.825
Tell her to talk to Wichai
in the office.

00:25:41.865 --> 00:25:42.705
What?

00:25:43.465 --> 00:25:45.105
Why are you giving up so easily?

00:25:46.345 --> 00:25:47.265
I'm not.

00:25:47.305 --> 00:25:48.665
I'm going to trick her.

00:25:51.065 --> 00:25:52.665
I want you to lure her out

00:25:52.705 --> 00:25:55.905
to where Duen and I will ambush her.

00:25:57.505 --> 00:25:58.385
Hold up...

00:25:58.865 --> 00:26:01.305
What if she brings
her underlings with her?

00:26:01.865 --> 00:26:02.545
Right.

00:26:03.285 --> 00:26:05.185
If you told her
to talk to Wichai in person,

00:26:05.225 --> 00:26:06.505
she wouldn't dare bring them.

00:26:06.545 --> 00:26:07.825
She's scared of him.

00:26:09.825 --> 00:26:10.705
This time...

00:26:11.265 --> 00:26:12.945
We'll deal with her once and for all.

00:26:14.785 --> 00:26:16.385
We'll make her know
that we're serious.

00:26:17.105 --> 00:26:19.385
That way,
she won't be in our hair later.

00:26:39.745 --> 00:26:40.945
I can't believe

00:26:41.465 --> 00:26:43.165
you've changed this much.

00:26:46.225 --> 00:26:48.105
When one has the money and power,

00:26:48.865 --> 00:26:50.185
life does get better.

00:26:51.565 --> 00:26:52.745
I mean,

00:26:53.345 --> 00:26:55.065
you've turned into
a sc*mmier person.

00:27:01.105 --> 00:27:02.225
What do you f*cking want?

00:27:03.745 --> 00:27:05.385
I'm here to tell you that

00:27:06.705 --> 00:27:08.145
we've paid off the debt.

00:27:08.825 --> 00:27:09.825
Go and check it yourself.

00:27:09.865 --> 00:27:11.025
I said I want the full amount.

00:27:12.665 --> 00:27:14.265
We've paid off both
the principal and interest.

00:27:15.025 --> 00:27:16.945
We even gave you 200 baht extra.

00:27:17.825 --> 00:27:18.945
Sis, let me go and check it.

00:27:19.225 --> 00:27:20.065
No need.

00:27:21.625 --> 00:27:22.825
They're honest.

00:27:30.185 --> 00:27:31.385
Don't you want to talk to me?

00:27:33.105 --> 00:27:34.505
I'm your old friend after all.

00:27:34.905 --> 00:27:36.005
I've got nothing to talk to.

00:27:37.625 --> 00:27:38.425
Let's go.

00:27:53.345 --> 00:27:55.745
So, we've both got nothing now,

00:27:56.785 --> 00:27:57.505
huh?

00:28:00.505 --> 00:28:01.785
Having you by my side

00:28:02.225 --> 00:28:03.745
just feels like
I've got everything I need.

00:28:04.805 --> 00:28:05.985
Aw.

00:28:06.025 --> 00:28:07.425
You're better at sweet talk now.

00:28:17.825 --> 00:28:20.025
Should we ask them
for a single bed?

00:28:22.585 --> 00:28:23.825
We never sleep on the upper bed.

00:28:31.145 --> 00:28:32.585
Come on, Dao...

00:28:32.625 --> 00:28:34.225
How am I going to
brush my teeth now?

00:28:36.465 --> 00:28:37.945
Do we also have to do it here?

00:28:38.225 --> 00:28:38.865
Gosh.

00:28:39.625 --> 00:28:41.625
This feels so sinful.

00:28:42.385 --> 00:28:45.185
There aren't any cameras here.

00:28:45.785 --> 00:28:47.185
This is the perfect spot.

00:28:50.105 --> 00:28:50.785
Here.

00:28:52.745 --> 00:28:54.385
Do I have to do it, too, Dao?

00:28:54.425 --> 00:28:55.145
What?

00:28:56.265 --> 00:28:57.545
Just in case she knows.

00:28:57.585 --> 00:28:58.825
Use it for self-defense.

00:29:06.545 --> 00:29:08.265
Are we really doing this?

00:29:11.345 --> 00:29:12.585
It's either them or us.

00:30:05.745 --> 00:30:07.225
Hey!

00:30:07.265 --> 00:30:09.425
Please let me have this!

00:30:09.705 --> 00:30:11.705
You can do better!

00:30:18.785 --> 00:30:20.625
I want to talk business with you.

00:30:23.745 --> 00:30:25.865
Do you think we've got anything left
to talk about?

00:30:27.925 --> 00:30:29.785
Fine. What is it?

00:30:30.785 --> 00:30:31.905
Let's hear it.

00:30:37.505 --> 00:30:38.425
Dao tells me to...

00:30:38.465 --> 00:30:39.585
Speak loudly!

00:30:39.985 --> 00:30:41.185
I can't f*cking hear you.

00:30:42.145 --> 00:30:44.945
Dao wants you to take control
of the entire business

00:30:44.985 --> 00:30:46.305
that Wichai provided her with,

00:30:46.705 --> 00:30:50.905
but you'd need to make us
your business partners.

00:30:53.185 --> 00:30:54.385
Um...

00:30:54.985 --> 00:30:56.345
Would she

00:30:57.065 --> 00:30:59.145
really sacrifice all her connections
in the prison

00:31:00.065 --> 00:31:02.145
just to be my business partner?

00:31:04.185 --> 00:31:06.825
Well, the earnings we've made here

00:31:08.745 --> 00:31:10.465
aren't doing as well as
your loan business.

00:31:11.545 --> 00:31:13.865
That's why she wants to negotiate.

00:31:15.265 --> 00:31:17.665
I guess she hasn't wanted
to do hard work lately.

00:31:18.585 --> 00:31:19.785
I can see that.

00:31:20.385 --> 00:31:22.105
She's pregnant after all.

00:31:23.465 --> 00:31:24.665
What did you just say?

00:31:25.225 --> 00:31:26.225
Pregnant?

00:31:36.825 --> 00:31:38.105
I'll talk.

00:31:42.545 --> 00:31:43.625
Let's go, girls.

00:31:46.585 --> 00:31:47.785
You're all going?

00:31:50.225 --> 00:31:51.545
What's the problem with that, huh?

00:31:53.175 --> 00:31:53.925
I...

00:31:54.545 --> 00:31:56.425
I'm worried this might upset Wichai.

00:31:57.545 --> 00:31:58.865
If I go alone

00:32:00.105 --> 00:32:02.105
and it's an ambush,

00:32:02.785 --> 00:32:03.985
what am I supposed to do?

00:32:15.375 --> 00:32:16.195
Come here.

00:32:23.665 --> 00:32:24.585
Not yet.

00:32:25.785 --> 00:32:26.985
It's best we wait here.

00:32:30.225 --> 00:32:31.465
Where's yours?

00:32:50.745 --> 00:32:51.865
Deedee.

00:32:55.585 --> 00:32:56.745
What's wrong with you?

00:32:57.705 --> 00:32:58.985
Why are you walking like that?

00:33:00.465 --> 00:33:01.545
I'm on my period.

00:33:01.585 --> 00:33:02.865
Let me do a quick check.

00:33:04.305 --> 00:33:05.305
Fine.

00:33:05.545 --> 00:33:06.865
Go and get it done.

00:33:07.345 --> 00:33:08.505
We can't have a negotiation

00:33:08.905 --> 00:33:10.465
if your pants are all messy.

00:33:10.865 --> 00:33:11.985
It'd be too disgusting.

00:33:12.825 --> 00:33:13.945
We'll wait here.

00:33:14.905 --> 00:33:15.825
Go on without me.

00:33:15.865 --> 00:33:16.985
I'll join you later.

00:33:21.045 --> 00:33:21.825
Okay.

00:33:26.065 --> 00:33:26.745
Yes, sis.

00:33:40.385 --> 00:33:41.385
Don't keep me waiting.

00:34:04.345 --> 00:34:05.625
Sis, we're screwed!

00:34:05.905 --> 00:34:06.865
They're all here!

00:34:06.905 --> 00:34:07.905
What do we do?

00:34:09.905 --> 00:34:11.905
At this rate,
there's no turning back.

00:34:33.415 --> 00:34:34.405
Be ready.

00:34:52.505 --> 00:34:53.505
Inmate Deedee.

00:34:54.785 --> 00:34:55.865
Please come with me.

00:34:57.985 --> 00:34:59.105
As for the rest...

00:34:59.345 --> 00:35:00.465
Please leave this area.

00:35:03.465 --> 00:35:04.785
I command you to leave.

00:35:10.305 --> 00:35:11.785
I guess we'll have a talk later.

00:35:15.105 --> 00:35:15.825
Let's go.

00:35:15.985 --> 00:35:16.865
Move it, girls.

00:35:23.305 --> 00:35:24.705
- Let me go.
- Please come with me.

00:35:31.665 --> 00:35:32.785
Where are you taking me to?

00:35:33.105 --> 00:35:33.825
Let me go.

00:35:33.865 --> 00:35:34.985
What the hell are you doing?

00:35:37.865 --> 00:35:38.745
Put it away.

00:35:44.065 --> 00:35:45.065
Let me go!

00:35:45.185 --> 00:35:46.065
Put me down!

00:35:46.185 --> 00:35:47.185
I told you to put me down!

00:35:47.225 --> 00:35:48.225
Let me go!

00:35:48.485 --> 00:35:49.625
Put me down, d*mn it!

00:35:49.825 --> 00:35:50.825
Put me down!

00:35:50.865 --> 00:35:51.785
Be quiet!

00:35:51.825 --> 00:35:52.945
Don't cause any trouble.

00:35:54.745 --> 00:35:56.105
You can't just keep me here!

00:35:56.145 --> 00:35:57.145
Let me out!

00:35:57.465 --> 00:35:58.385
Let me out!

00:35:58.425 --> 00:35:59.345
Let me go...

00:35:59.625 --> 00:36:00.505
I'm scared of the dark!

00:36:00.545 --> 00:36:01.785
I don't wanna be here!

00:36:21.225 --> 00:36:22.025
Hey.

00:36:23.425 --> 00:36:25.625
The new guard
put Deedee in confinement.

00:36:26.525 --> 00:36:27.905
What do you want me to do?

00:36:28.365 --> 00:36:30.505
Can you tell him to free her?

00:36:31.005 --> 00:36:32.345
I'm afraid I can't do that.

00:36:33.585 --> 00:36:34.745
Why not?

00:36:34.785 --> 00:36:36.025
You're the warden.

00:36:38.465 --> 00:36:40.465
Porches spoke
to the director himself.

00:36:41.105 --> 00:36:42.905
He also gave him the green light.

00:36:45.465 --> 00:36:46.665
What's that son of a b*tch good for?

00:36:46.705 --> 00:36:48.505
Why are you always protecting him?

00:36:49.825 --> 00:36:50.705
You let him mess around,

00:36:50.745 --> 00:36:52.465
and now almost everything
is going to sh*t.

00:36:53.625 --> 00:36:54.785
What kind of warden

00:36:54.825 --> 00:36:56.265
can't control his guards?

00:36:57.025 --> 00:36:58.225
He's my son!

00:36:59.905 --> 00:37:01.065
He is my son!

00:37:01.105 --> 00:37:02.305
Do you get it now, Dao?!

00:37:18.385 --> 00:37:20.585
And you let him work here

00:37:22.685 --> 00:37:24.465
in a room where we f*ck?!

00:37:24.505 --> 00:37:25.585
Are you f*cking nuts?

00:37:32.865 --> 00:37:34.185
Your wife asked for this, huh?

00:37:34.425 --> 00:37:35.825
So you just had to do it, right?

00:37:36.685 --> 00:37:38.165
You said you broke up with her...

00:37:39.065 --> 00:37:40.145
Was that a lie?

00:37:51.865 --> 00:37:53.345
What did you expect?

00:37:54.985 --> 00:37:57.465
You expected us
to live happily together?

00:38:00.225 --> 00:38:01.385
You're an inmate.

00:38:02.465 --> 00:38:04.265
I'm the warden.

00:38:04.825 --> 00:38:06.865
It's already wrong
right from the start.

00:38:07.705 --> 00:38:09.505
Then why did you
start the relationship with me?

00:38:09.745 --> 00:38:11.265
Why the f*ck did you give me hope?!

00:38:13.505 --> 00:38:15.265
When the f*ck did I do that?!

00:38:16.345 --> 00:38:18.545
We had a great time together,
didn't we?

00:38:19.265 --> 00:38:20.745
I've treated you well,

00:38:21.585 --> 00:38:23.545
but if you ask more than this,

00:38:23.785 --> 00:38:25.185
I can't give it to you.

00:38:25.585 --> 00:38:26.785
Get it, Dao?

00:38:28.905 --> 00:38:29.905
This place

00:38:30.585 --> 00:38:31.865
isn't the real world.

00:38:32.545 --> 00:38:35.545
My real world is f*cking out there!

00:38:51.545 --> 00:38:52.865
You got me pregnant.

00:38:53.545 --> 00:38:54.745
Is reality hitting you now?

00:39:13.665 --> 00:39:15.265
Why did you let it happen,

00:39:15.505 --> 00:39:16.265
huh?!

00:39:16.945 --> 00:39:18.345
Why didn't you use contraception?!

00:39:18.385 --> 00:39:19.625
You also had sex with me.

00:39:19.945 --> 00:39:21.425
So why didn't you use protection?

00:39:22.105 --> 00:39:22.865
You...

00:39:23.565 --> 00:39:24.905
Go and get an abortion.

00:39:25.025 --> 00:39:25.985
Get rid of the newborn.

00:39:26.025 --> 00:39:27.185
I refuse!

00:39:27.865 --> 00:39:29.425
I've already left my son out there.

00:39:29.465 --> 00:39:31.025
I'm not letting this one slip away.

00:39:37.945 --> 00:39:39.145
You refuse?

00:39:43.305 --> 00:39:44.705
I will not let you

00:39:45.865 --> 00:39:47.545
ruin my life.

00:39:48.905 --> 00:39:50.505
Get an abortion right now.

00:39:51.865 --> 00:39:53.545
Get an abortion immediately.

00:40:17.505 --> 00:40:18.505
I...

00:40:19.265 --> 00:40:20.265
I'm sorry.

00:40:20.545 --> 00:40:21.545
I didn't mean it.

00:40:22.105 --> 00:40:22.905
Dao!

00:40:31.425 --> 00:40:32.425
Can I ask you a question?

00:40:32.845 --> 00:40:34.425
Why did you settle on growing the roses?

00:40:36.385 --> 00:40:38.225
When I first ended up here,

00:40:38.905 --> 00:40:40.345
I was out of my mind.

00:40:41.225 --> 00:40:43.905
Pa'Porn suggested
I do some gardening,

00:40:45.065 --> 00:40:46.545
so I'd have something to do

00:40:47.105 --> 00:40:48.505
and could pull myself together.

00:40:50.145 --> 00:40:51.745
Then I asked her

00:40:52.485 --> 00:40:53.785
which plant was the hardest to grow.

00:40:55.045 --> 00:40:56.745
She said she didn't know,

00:40:58.745 --> 00:40:59.985
but her favorite plant was

00:41:01.705 --> 00:41:02.705
roses.

00:41:04.065 --> 00:41:05.225
Since then,

00:41:06.105 --> 00:41:08.425
I've been trying my best
to make them bloom...

00:41:09.785 --> 00:41:11.425
for her to see.

00:41:17.265 --> 00:41:18.345
But it was too late.

00:41:23.665 --> 00:41:25.385
I'm sure she can see them
from up there.

00:41:28.025 --> 00:41:29.025
Inmate Bell.

00:41:29.345 --> 00:41:30.265
A visitor would like to see you.

00:41:32.905 --> 00:41:33.905
Hurry. Get up.

00:42:20.625 --> 00:42:21.825
What are you doing here, Beam?

00:42:24.785 --> 00:42:25.905
How are you doing, Bell?

00:42:28.145 --> 00:42:29.945
On that day, I did it because...

00:42:31.185 --> 00:42:32.505
I didn't think it through.

00:42:32.545 --> 00:42:34.025
I'm really sorry.

00:42:35.385 --> 00:42:36.385
What did you do?

00:42:39.505 --> 00:42:41.145
The drugs at the bar...

00:42:42.625 --> 00:42:43.905
They were Top's.

00:42:46.905 --> 00:42:48.145
Yes, they were his.

[Roses]

00:43:38.385 --> 00:43:39.385
What's wrong?

00:43:40.985 --> 00:43:41.985
Earlier...

00:43:42.465 --> 00:43:44.345
The person who put the drugs
in my handbag

00:43:45.505 --> 00:43:47.285
visited me and told me

00:43:47.325 --> 00:43:48.825
he was going to turn himself in.

00:43:53.025 --> 00:43:54.625
I'm about to be free now.

00:44:03.145 --> 00:44:04.305
I'm so happy for you.

[Claire & Bell]

00:44:46.145 --> 00:44:47.545
Screaming this much...

00:44:47.865 --> 00:44:49.065
You're gonna
have no voice tomorrow.

00:44:56.025 --> 00:44:57.465
Could you let me out

00:44:57.665 --> 00:44:58.865
at least for a little while?

00:45:00.185 --> 00:45:01.065
How about

00:45:01.505 --> 00:45:03.425
I'll talk to you for a while,

00:45:03.585 --> 00:45:04.745
so you won't be scared.

00:45:04.905 --> 00:45:05.905
Agreed?

00:45:06.985 --> 00:45:07.825
Sure.

00:45:07.865 --> 00:45:09.065
Don't go anywhere, okay?

00:45:10.905 --> 00:45:12.545
Hey! Why did you close the panel?!

00:45:13.705 --> 00:45:15.385
You said you'd stay!

00:45:16.505 --> 00:45:18.505
I don't wanna be alone.

00:45:20.065 --> 00:45:21.305
I'm scared.

00:45:29.305 --> 00:45:30.305
I'm still here.

00:46:04.425 --> 00:46:05.825
Since you're going to be free,

00:46:05.865 --> 00:46:07.465
should we go out
and do something fun?

00:46:10.265 --> 00:46:11.785
Mm. Sure.

00:47:02.825 --> 00:47:03.825
Give it a try, okay?

00:47:04.725 --> 00:47:05.725
Are you sure?

00:47:06.045 --> 00:47:06.865
Mm.

00:47:28.545 --> 00:47:29.345
Hey!

00:47:30.265 --> 00:47:31.425
What happened?

00:47:32.225 --> 00:47:33.745
What the hell happened?

00:47:36.545 --> 00:47:37.785
Are you there?

00:47:42.905 --> 00:47:43.705
The power went out.

00:47:43.745 --> 00:47:44.745
I'll go investigate.

00:47:45.005 --> 00:47:46.005
No!

00:47:46.545 --> 00:47:47.505
I don't wanna be alone.

00:47:47.545 --> 00:47:48.545
I'm scared.

00:47:53.625 --> 00:47:54.625
No need to investigate.

00:47:55.705 --> 00:47:56.905
Power outages are common here.

00:47:57.265 --> 00:47:58.425
The power should be back soon.

00:47:59.345 --> 00:48:00.265
Okay.

00:48:09.705 --> 00:48:10.785
Are you still there?

00:48:12.265 --> 00:48:13.945
Mm. I'm still here.

00:48:57.265 --> 00:48:58.185
The power's back.

00:48:58.225 --> 00:48:59.105
Should we leave?

00:48:59.665 --> 00:49:00.665
It's fine.

00:49:00.785 --> 00:49:02.655
The computer
that monitors the cameras is old.

00:49:02.695 --> 00:49:04.145
It'd take hours to reboot.

00:49:04.185 --> 00:49:04.905
Come on!

00:49:09.385 --> 00:49:10.665
What flavor do you want?

00:49:11.385 --> 00:49:12.385
No, I'll pick it for you.

00:49:12.425 --> 00:49:13.105
Okay.

00:49:15.225 --> 00:49:17.025
You're not sassy.

00:49:18.425 --> 00:49:20.825
Yet, you're also not that prim.

00:49:21.125 --> 00:49:23.385
Sometimes,
you show your fiery side.

00:49:24.705 --> 00:49:25.905
And you like to share, too.

00:49:26.585 --> 00:49:28.345
Alright, I'll go with this one.

00:49:30.025 --> 00:49:30.745
Here.

00:49:31.985 --> 00:49:33.465
What does this
have to do with sharing?

00:49:34.665 --> 00:49:35.785
You have to share it with me.

00:49:36.025 --> 00:49:37.025
Gosh!

00:50:16.225 --> 00:50:17.625
There are so many jobs out there,

00:50:18.145 --> 00:50:19.665
but why a guard?

00:50:22.385 --> 00:50:23.785
Isn't it worse

00:50:24.205 --> 00:50:25.305
being an inmate?

00:50:27.065 --> 00:50:28.665
Yeah, you have a point.

00:50:32.625 --> 00:50:34.305
I can't get along with others that well.

00:50:35.945 --> 00:50:37.665
They say that I'm too blunt.

00:50:39.385 --> 00:50:40.585
You're not blunt.

00:50:40.905 --> 00:50:42.625
You're just clueless.

00:50:45.145 --> 00:50:46.745
Are you taking a jab at me?

00:50:47.705 --> 00:50:48.985
I'm not.

00:50:52.025 --> 00:50:53.625
Isn't 'clueless' an insult?

00:50:58.505 --> 00:50:59.385
Like...

00:51:00.065 --> 00:51:02.265
Gosh. How do I explain this?

00:51:03.745 --> 00:51:05.265
You're like a clueless person.

00:51:05.785 --> 00:51:07.585
You're lost and confused,

00:51:08.245 --> 00:51:10.245
doing things you think are good

00:51:11.305 --> 00:51:13.585
without considering
how others might feel.

00:51:14.585 --> 00:51:15.585
Get it?

00:51:19.265 --> 00:51:20.985
You've never been in a relationship?

00:51:24.145 --> 00:51:25.145
I haven't.

00:51:26.225 --> 00:51:27.225
I knew it.

00:51:27.625 --> 00:51:30.105
If my predictions are this good,
I could win the lottery.

00:51:32.585 --> 00:51:33.785
You seem like

00:51:35.025 --> 00:51:37.025
you've dated a lot.

00:51:39.225 --> 00:51:40.905
When it comes to men,

00:51:41.965 --> 00:51:43.425
I've dated a couple.

00:51:43.925 --> 00:51:45.105
For girls...

00:51:45.505 --> 00:51:46.985
I've also dated a couple of them.

00:51:48.345 --> 00:51:50.345
But as for dating a guard...

00:51:52.265 --> 00:51:53.585
I've never dated one.

00:51:58.705 --> 00:52:00.105
It's impossible, I'm afraid.

00:52:00.905 --> 00:52:01.905
It's against the rules.

00:52:04.185 --> 00:52:05.185
See?

00:52:05.225 --> 00:52:06.625
You really are clueless.

00:52:08.505 --> 00:52:10.505
What exactly does 'clueless'
mean to you?

00:52:13.145 --> 00:52:14.425
Here's an example.

00:52:15.625 --> 00:52:18.865
When a girl watches a horror movie
with her partner

00:52:19.865 --> 00:52:21.065
and says,

00:52:21.625 --> 00:52:23.105
"It's so scary."

00:52:24.065 --> 00:52:26.065
It doesn't mean that she's scared.

00:52:26.625 --> 00:52:28.025
She just wants a hug.

00:52:28.665 --> 00:52:31.265
But her partner can't read the room,

00:52:31.705 --> 00:52:33.625
so they take her out of the theater.

00:52:33.745 --> 00:52:35.745
It's something like that.
You feel me?

00:52:41.425 --> 00:52:42.545
Uh...

00:52:44.025 --> 00:52:45.825
You said you're scared of the dark...

00:52:46.845 --> 00:52:48.445
Are you actually scared of it

00:52:49.225 --> 00:52:50.625
or just want me to stay with you?

00:52:57.825 --> 00:52:59.425
I'm actually scared, okay?

00:53:07.625 --> 00:53:08.545
But...

00:53:10.345 --> 00:53:11.945
I also want you to stay close to me.

00:53:32.785 --> 00:53:34.585
See? You like sharing.

00:53:40.345 --> 00:53:41.345
So good.

00:53:50.065 --> 00:53:51.265
I'd actually like to have it,

00:53:52.105 --> 00:53:53.265
but I have a shellfish allergy.

00:53:54.305 --> 00:53:55.505
Aww...

00:53:55.545 --> 00:53:57.145
You're missing out, you know?

00:54:15.585 --> 00:54:16.785
I'm stuffed!

00:54:18.665 --> 00:54:19.665
Whoa...

00:54:19.785 --> 00:54:21.385
You stole my cup, too!

00:54:30.465 --> 00:54:32.745
It's been a long time
since I got to stargaze like this.

00:54:35.785 --> 00:54:37.065
Me too.

00:54:38.265 --> 00:54:39.545
Staying here...

00:54:39.745 --> 00:54:41.185
If I didn't break out
of the cell at night,

00:54:41.225 --> 00:54:42.745
I wouldn't get to
see anything like this.

00:54:47.665 --> 00:54:49.545
I've never stargazed
when I was out there.

00:54:51.105 --> 00:54:52.105
It feels like...

00:54:52.605 --> 00:54:54.745
When I could see the stars
every night,

00:54:55.985 --> 00:54:57.425
I started taking them for granted

00:54:58.665 --> 00:55:00.465
and stopped appreciating them.

00:55:04.865 --> 00:55:06.065
Soon...

00:55:07.185 --> 00:55:09.185
You'll get to see the stars
in the world out there.

00:55:19.545 --> 00:55:21.345
It's different from here, though.

00:55:26.745 --> 00:55:28.345
They look the same
under any night sky.

00:55:35.545 --> 00:55:36.745
The stars are the same,

00:55:39.425 --> 00:55:41.025
but the experience is different.

00:56:01.505 --> 00:56:02.505
You know...

00:56:05.025 --> 00:56:06.745
I've heard that

00:56:08.625 --> 00:56:10.345
the stars that we're seeing...

00:56:11.245 --> 00:56:13.505
Before the light reaches our planet,

00:56:14.145 --> 00:56:16.465
it takes millions of years.

00:56:19.565 --> 00:56:20.865
Sometimes,

00:56:21.785 --> 00:56:23.465
the stars we're seeing...

00:56:25.865 --> 00:56:28.665
They might not exist anymore.

00:56:33.705 --> 00:56:35.185
This means that...

00:56:36.185 --> 00:56:38.585
If aliens are looking
at Earth right now,

00:56:39.725 --> 00:56:41.545
by the time
they could see us lying here,

00:56:41.785 --> 00:56:43.085
it'd take millions of years for them?

00:56:46.065 --> 00:56:47.665
Let's make cute poses

00:56:48.265 --> 00:56:50.385
for the aliens millions
of light-years away,

00:56:50.785 --> 00:56:51.785
okay?

00:56:53.465 --> 00:56:54.665
Yay!

00:57:00.265 --> 00:57:01.385
Let's do a heart pose.

00:57:03.385 --> 00:57:04.185
This one.

00:58:20.465 --> 00:58:21.265
Should we head back?

00:58:22.105 --> 00:58:23.425
No, I'm not leaving.

00:58:23.705 --> 00:58:24.585
Come on.

00:58:25.465 --> 00:58:27.065
- We'll get soaked.
- I'm staying here.

00:58:28.265 --> 00:58:29.345
This is the last night.

00:58:30.865 --> 00:58:31.945
Let's get soaked.

00:58:39.385 --> 00:58:40.265
Natty.

00:58:41.745 --> 00:58:42.585
We're here.

00:58:44.225 --> 00:58:45.145
We've arrived.

00:59:07.305 --> 00:59:08.505
No one should be here.

00:59:12.065 --> 00:59:13.065
Thanks.

00:59:15.305 --> 00:59:16.425
Are you sure you're okay?

00:59:17.385 --> 00:59:18.185
Mm.

00:59:51.305 --> 00:59:51.865
Natty!

00:59:51.905 --> 00:59:52.545
Sh*t!

00:59:55.625 --> 00:59:56.905
Are you really sure you're fine?

00:59:58.865 --> 00:59:59.665
Mm.

01:00:48.365 --> 01:00:49.665
I've learned all of the truth.

01:00:52.425 --> 01:00:54.025
The news reporters came here...

01:00:55.985 --> 01:00:57.185
Was it because of the incident?

01:01:17.785 --> 01:01:18.885
Please help me unlock my phone.

01:01:18.985 --> 01:01:20.485
I forgot the password.

01:01:21.385 --> 01:01:22.265
A phone this old...

01:01:22.305 --> 01:01:23.685
I can tell this is not yours.

01:01:24.065 --> 01:01:24.945
Whose is this?

01:01:26.485 --> 01:01:27.865
It's fine
if you don't want to tell me.

01:01:28.225 --> 01:01:30.105
I'm not doing
something illegal, right?

01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:31.705
You're not.

01:01:33.025 --> 01:01:34.305
It was my brother's.

01:01:35.345 --> 01:01:37.265
It's a bit upsetting, really.

01:01:37.305 --> 01:01:38.745
But it's okay.

01:01:39.065 --> 01:01:40.705
When I first ended up here,

01:01:40.745 --> 01:01:42.145
I wasn't really myself.

01:01:42.945 --> 01:01:45.185
Over time,

01:01:45.465 --> 01:01:48.265
I realized that I could order things

01:01:48.865 --> 01:01:50.025
and do my hair.

01:01:50.225 --> 01:01:51.865
That's when I started
feeling more confident.

01:01:52.345 --> 01:01:55.945
♫Please don't leave me alone♫

01:01:56.745 --> 01:02:00.345
♫Please don't lock me up by myself♫

01:02:00.985 --> 01:02:08.785
♫Please don't let me suffer
and drown in my thoughts♫

01:02:09.465 --> 01:02:13.065
♫I, too, can shed a tear♫

01:02:13.665 --> 01:02:17.465
♫I'm as frail as others can be♫

01:02:17.865 --> 01:02:26.065
♫Despite that, all I can do
is keep everything in my mind♫

01:02:32.025 --> 01:02:32.825
It's done.

01:02:34.825 --> 01:02:42.425
♫Everything has remained
as beautiful as we've dreamed♫

01:02:46.105 --> 01:02:47.385
Tell me the truth, dear.

01:02:49.545 --> 01:02:50.785
Regardless...

01:02:52.785 --> 01:02:54.185
You and Claire

01:02:56.505 --> 01:02:58.065
are both my daughters.

01:03:00.625 --> 01:03:06.985
♫I'd like to ask you something
if you really have to leave♫

01:03:07.025 --> 01:03:09.105
I was the one who did it.

01:03:11.265 --> 01:03:13.465
I killed that teacher.

01:03:33.465 --> 01:03:34.585
When I was little,

01:03:34.625 --> 01:03:37.945
Dao told me that
I had to take care of myself.

01:03:37.985 --> 01:03:39.985
At the end of the day,
Duen had to take care of me.

01:03:41.785 --> 01:03:42.785
Are you still there?

01:03:43.545 --> 01:03:44.425
Have you been listening?

01:03:57.865 --> 01:03:58.865
Come here!

01:03:59.905 --> 01:04:01.025
No! No!

01:04:03.745 --> 01:04:11.345
♫If, from now on, it's simply a dream,♫

01:04:12.225 --> 01:04:20.225
♫I hope there's a day
that our paths will cross♫

01:04:20.865 --> 01:04:26.305
♫So please do not forget about me♫
