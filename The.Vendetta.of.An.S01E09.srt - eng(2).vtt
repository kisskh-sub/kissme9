Mr. Long,

00:01:46.065 --> 00:01:49.785
I've never had a serious illness
or chronic condition.

00:01:49.865 --> 00:01:53.105
Why do I have
to come for my pulse check every month?

00:01:53.185 --> 00:01:55.785
You were born with white hair.

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:58.505
Only at this age
has it fully turned black.

00:01:58.585 --> 00:01:59.865
Ancient texts say

00:02:00.465 --> 00:02:02.425
children born white-haired
face half a life of hardship.

00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:04.985
No one can command the workings of fate.

00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:08.864
Your father and I both hope
you grow up safe.

00:02:18.585 --> 00:02:20.145
So what if half my life is hardship?

00:02:20.945 --> 00:02:22.705
What matters is
the rest brims with sweetness.

00:02:24.425 --> 00:02:26.025
True.

00:02:26.105 --> 00:02:29.265
So young, yet already so enlightened.

00:02:38.465 --> 00:02:41.225
Thank you, Mr. Long. I'll be going now.

00:02:47.305 --> 00:02:49.945
Half a life of hardship,
half a life of sweetness.

00:02:56.385 --> 00:03:00.425
The worry is you might have
only the bitter half.

00:03:12.945 --> 00:03:13.825
I have to go.

00:03:16.345 --> 00:03:19.345
-Where are you going?
-Gu Yu was taken by Huben.

00:03:19.945 --> 00:03:24.105
Barring surprises, they'll hold Gu Yu
in Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:28.945
Therefore, I must infiltrate
Hidden Soldier Alley and rescue Gu Yu.

00:03:29.025 --> 00:03:30.465
-You must be joking.
-You're injured

00:03:30.545 --> 00:03:32.065
and still want to risk your life?
Are you mad?

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:33.785
He's right.
You haven't even recovered yet.

00:03:33.865 --> 00:03:36.625
Going into Hidden Soldier Alley now
is as good as a death sentence.

00:03:36.705 --> 00:03:38.505
He's right. And consider me too.

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:39.705
You just secured a safe place for me.

00:03:39.785 --> 00:03:41.905
What if Huben comes after me again
after you leave?

00:03:41.985 --> 00:03:43.745
What can he do?
He's all brawn and no brain.

00:03:43.825 --> 00:03:45.545
-He can't handle them.
-I'll handle you right now.

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:54.065
But on the other hand,

00:03:54.145 --> 00:03:57.385
compared to you,
I'm better suited to fighting and killing.

00:03:57.465 --> 00:04:00.225
I must be the one
to enter the enemy's lair.

00:04:00.305 --> 00:04:01.185
No.

00:04:03.145 --> 00:04:04.265
I must go.

00:04:07.785 --> 00:04:12.305
If anyone knows Huben the best, it's me.

00:04:25.545 --> 00:04:27.665
Why are you staring at me?
Get back to work.

00:04:28.265 --> 00:04:29.265
I…

00:04:54.785 --> 00:04:55.825
STEAMED BUNS

00:05:29.305 --> 00:05:30.185
Come in.

00:05:47.225 --> 00:05:49.105
You're heading into Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:05:49.705 --> 00:05:52.545
Can I help with anything?

00:05:55.265 --> 00:05:59.985
Or is there something I can do for you?

00:06:12.425 --> 00:06:15.825
Actually, I do require some preparations.

00:06:17.025 --> 00:06:20.505
First, to enter Hidden Soldier Alley,

00:06:21.185 --> 00:06:23.545
I'll need Huben's custom gold coins.

00:06:24.465 --> 00:06:26.065
Qingyi has one.

00:06:26.825 --> 00:06:28.105
Go get it.

00:06:28.185 --> 00:06:30.505
If he refuses,

00:06:31.265 --> 00:06:34.625
you're to order
the death of every Huben member

00:06:34.705 --> 00:06:37.065
who has seen my face

00:06:39.385 --> 00:06:40.945
on the night of the raid.

00:06:44.665 --> 00:06:45.585
Well…

00:06:46.585 --> 00:06:49.905
What if he agrees?

00:06:49.985 --> 00:06:51.745
He won't.

00:07:56.625 --> 00:07:57.785
Move it!

00:08:37.385 --> 00:08:39.264
I'm not forcing you to kill.

00:08:39.945 --> 00:08:43.784
I just want you to understand
that this is a ruthless world.

00:08:45.185 --> 00:08:46.225
Some blood…

00:08:48.025 --> 00:08:49.105
must be spilled.

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:54.705
Maybe you'll face moments like this
in the future.

00:08:56.145 --> 00:08:59.465
When that time comes,
you'll know what to do.

00:09:04.025 --> 00:09:05.105
The second thing.

00:09:05.625 --> 00:09:08.505
I need a new identity.

00:09:09.225 --> 00:09:12.705
Xiaoqing's already handled that.

00:09:31.065 --> 00:09:32.665
IMPERIAL PHYSICIAN'S HALL

00:09:36.025 --> 00:09:39.065
That's a massive and showy sign.

00:09:39.145 --> 00:09:40.865
Can we even trust that physician?

00:09:51.865 --> 00:09:52.825
Got it.

00:10:02.385 --> 00:10:03.345
What's all the--

00:10:03.425 --> 00:10:06.065
BLESSINGS ABOUND

00:10:06.665 --> 00:10:08.145
Come in. Get inside.

00:10:10.825 --> 00:10:11.985
The door…

00:10:27.265 --> 00:10:29.705
The members of Huben
have been acting discreetly.

00:10:29.785 --> 00:10:31.905
Few come and go in Chang'an.

00:10:31.985 --> 00:10:33.585
Our people have watched for some time.

00:10:33.665 --> 00:10:35.785
Only this man here fits your criteria.

00:10:35.865 --> 00:10:40.145
His name is Wang Xing.
His age and build are similar to yours.

00:10:40.225 --> 00:10:43.665
He knows no martial arts.
His moves are as clumsy as yours.

00:10:43.745 --> 00:10:45.065
He has no close friends.

00:10:45.665 --> 00:10:47.185
But he's married.

00:10:47.265 --> 00:10:49.185
His wife resides in Chang'an.

00:10:51.505 --> 00:10:52.545
Did you get everything out of him?

00:10:52.625 --> 00:10:55.145
Of course.
You can trust me to get the job done.

00:10:55.945 --> 00:10:57.465
Not enough yet. Question him again.

00:10:59.145 --> 00:11:01.225
Bring his wife here.

00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:03.985
If his answers don't match,

00:11:04.065 --> 00:11:07.465
break a finger and give it to him.

00:11:07.545 --> 00:11:09.865
That's the only way to secure
reliable answers.

00:11:09.945 --> 00:11:10.985
You heard him.

00:11:11.065 --> 00:11:12.345
Weigh your words carefully.

00:11:12.425 --> 00:11:14.305
What if anything goes wrong?

00:11:14.385 --> 00:11:15.705
You might have ten fingers,

00:11:15.785 --> 00:11:18.505
but that won't save your wife
from breaking.

00:11:22.425 --> 00:11:24.265
You're animals.

00:11:24.345 --> 00:11:26.385
Even if you ask me 100 times,

00:11:26.465 --> 00:11:29.385
I'll still answer the same.

00:11:29.465 --> 00:11:31.545
Come at me all you want.

00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:35.425
But if you so much
as lay a finger on my wife…

00:11:37.745 --> 00:11:39.145
I'm talking to you!

00:11:39.225 --> 00:11:40.265
I swear I'll…

00:11:55.425 --> 00:11:57.665
So, when do we bring his wife here?

00:12:09.905 --> 00:12:11.625
IMPERIAL PHYSICIAN'S HALL

00:12:11.705 --> 00:12:15.145
All these passes were seized
from Wang Xing.

00:12:15.225 --> 00:12:16.545
He's a skilled forger.

00:12:16.625 --> 00:12:18.945
Even I nearly missed the flaws.

00:12:19.025 --> 00:12:20.105
He's an expert.

00:12:20.185 --> 00:12:22.225
No wonder Huben transferred him here.

00:12:22.305 --> 00:12:24.065
Hidden Soldier Alley

00:12:24.865 --> 00:12:29.425
always stations experts
to forge papers and identities.

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:35.185
Since the new emperor
issued his warrant against Huben,

00:12:35.265 --> 00:12:36.745
any Huben men in the capital

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:40.785
need forged travel passes
for even the slightest movement.

00:12:41.385 --> 00:12:44.625
Something must have happened
to the previous forger.

00:12:44.705 --> 00:12:47.825
That's why they need
an outsider to fill in.

00:12:51.545 --> 00:12:52.945
Where's Wang Xing's gold coin?

00:12:57.625 --> 00:12:59.505
I almost forgot about that.

00:13:02.025 --> 00:13:04.385
You didn't forget.
You wanted it for yourself.

00:13:13.825 --> 00:13:14.665
Remember.

00:13:15.305 --> 00:13:19.705
These coins will bring death
if used anywhere else.

00:13:20.465 --> 00:13:22.945
They're only for coming
and going in Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:13:23.025 --> 00:13:24.425
Huai'an.

00:13:24.505 --> 00:13:27.665
You're injured, and you insist on
taking this mission on alone.

00:13:28.385 --> 00:13:29.625
I'm worried.

00:13:30.985 --> 00:13:32.665
Don't worry.

00:13:32.745 --> 00:13:36.825
I bought you
a flatbread stall outside the alley.

00:13:37.585 --> 00:13:39.545
If something happens, I'll contact you.

00:13:47.785 --> 00:13:50.625
But not you. The stall
is too close to Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:53.705
You can't go there. You'll work
at the physician's hall in the meantime.

00:13:55.465 --> 00:13:56.985
-That's not necessary.
-No.

00:13:57.065 --> 00:14:01.105
I… I feel safer if I'm with you.

00:14:01.185 --> 00:14:03.545
Last time I delivered a letter,
I caused trouble for you.

00:14:03.625 --> 00:14:05.905
I need to vet all my people.

00:14:05.985 --> 00:14:08.025
Now, I only have
a few trusted ones who can be used.

00:14:08.105 --> 00:14:11.385
I can't take care of him too.
And that Wang Xing as well.

00:14:11.465 --> 00:14:13.305
Get him out of here as soon as possible.

00:14:13.385 --> 00:14:14.745
The physician's hall
may not be safe either.

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:19.865
Then, why don't I
watch over that Wang Xing?

00:14:19.945 --> 00:14:20.865
You?

00:14:20.945 --> 00:14:22.665
Yes. You just need to tie him up securely.

00:14:22.745 --> 00:14:24.745
I'll watch him and bring his meals.

00:14:24.825 --> 00:14:25.945
That's simple enough.

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:30.065
But where will we hold him?

00:14:30.145 --> 00:14:31.465
Well…

00:14:33.065 --> 00:14:35.745
The place where they locked me up before.

00:14:36.345 --> 00:14:39.505
I'll just do as you guys did
and put him there.

00:14:39.585 --> 00:14:41.665
All right. It's settled, then.

00:14:42.505 --> 00:14:45.025
If you slip up and Wang Xing runs back

00:14:45.625 --> 00:14:47.305
to Hidden Soldier Alley,

00:14:47.385 --> 00:14:48.985
the whole plan will fall apart.

00:14:49.065 --> 00:14:50.465
And I'll lose my life.

00:14:51.505 --> 00:14:52.625
Don't worry.

00:14:52.705 --> 00:14:55.625
Your life is in my hands. Safe and sound.

00:14:58.585 --> 00:14:59.505
Master.

00:15:01.105 --> 00:15:05.065
You just escaped death,
and now you're going to risk it again?

00:15:06.305 --> 00:15:07.265
Have you thought this through?

00:15:20.385 --> 00:15:23.145
The Huben Army was built
by my father's own hands.

00:15:23.745 --> 00:15:27.145
What they can do,
I've learned by ear and eye.

00:15:27.225 --> 00:15:30.465
What they can't, I've taught myself much.

00:15:30.545 --> 00:15:32.105
I know what I'm doing, Mr. Long.

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:36.665
I've sealed your wounds with fish maw

00:15:36.745 --> 00:15:38.585
and covered them with human skin.

00:15:38.665 --> 00:15:40.865
You look no different from anyone else.

00:15:40.945 --> 00:15:45.065
No one will notice
unless they get up close.

00:15:52.145 --> 00:15:54.385
You were born with white hair.

00:15:55.385 --> 00:15:59.465
As you aged,

00:15:59.545 --> 00:16:02.865
the white turned black.

00:16:03.385 --> 00:16:07.865
Both your father and I share one wish.

00:16:08.905 --> 00:16:12.265
We only hope you live safely

00:16:13.065 --> 00:16:15.345
to see your hair turn gray once more.

00:16:20.585 --> 00:16:21.625
My boy,

00:16:24.065 --> 00:16:25.345
come back alive.

00:16:31.625 --> 00:16:35.345
IMPERIAL PHYSICIAN'S HALL

00:16:35.425 --> 00:16:38.145
BLESSINGS ABOUND, MISFORTUNE FADES

00:16:51.385 --> 00:16:52.905
Don't look at me like that.

00:16:52.985 --> 00:16:55.545
When everything's settled,
I'll dye my hair black again.

00:16:58.505 --> 00:16:59.625
Let's go.

00:17:08.224 --> 00:17:11.985
Is this the Hidden Soldier Alley
you mentioned?

00:17:12.065 --> 00:17:13.464
No.

00:17:13.545 --> 00:17:16.065
Did you bring
the clean clothes I asked for?

00:17:16.145 --> 00:17:18.105
Yes. They're in the carriage.

00:17:35.385 --> 00:17:39.105
Huai'an, what exactly are you looking at?

00:17:40.145 --> 00:17:45.145
I'm wondering how badly I'd be hurt
if I tumbled down this mountain.

00:17:45.785 --> 00:17:47.025
Are you joking?

00:17:47.105 --> 00:17:48.505
If you fall, you won't survive…

00:17:49.265 --> 00:17:50.305
Huai'an!

00:17:50.385 --> 00:17:51.225
Xie Huai'an!

00:18:02.585 --> 00:18:04.385
Huai'an. Huai'an. Are you all right?

00:18:07.145 --> 00:18:09.585
Have you lost your mind?
Did you actually want to die?

00:18:15.385 --> 00:18:18.665
Xie Huai'an, why did you do that?
Have you lost your senses?

00:18:18.745 --> 00:18:21.385
If you die, what'll happen to me?
Who'll protect me?

00:18:22.905 --> 00:18:26.545
That's why I was trying
to find the right spot.

00:18:26.625 --> 00:18:30.505
These injuries will be useful
inside Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:18:30.585 --> 00:18:33.265
Come on. Help me up.

00:18:39.345 --> 00:18:40.585
Are you all right?

00:18:49.105 --> 00:18:50.505
What's that in your hand?

00:18:51.105 --> 00:18:52.505
They call this Bitter-After.

00:18:52.585 --> 00:18:54.665
It grows in the north
and is extremely bitter.

00:18:54.745 --> 00:18:58.145
I observed Wang Xing.
He has a habit of chewing on this.

00:19:03.065 --> 00:19:04.145
The taste is certainly bitter.

00:19:05.105 --> 00:19:06.305
I don't believe you.

00:19:06.385 --> 00:19:08.185
It can't be that bitter. Let me try it.

00:19:17.425 --> 00:19:18.705
This is incredibly bitter.

00:19:18.785 --> 00:19:20.865
Why would anyone like to chew this stuff?

00:19:21.425 --> 00:19:23.545
Bitterness refreshes and relieves fatigue.

00:19:23.625 --> 00:19:27.185
The people in the north chew it
to stave off the cold.

00:19:28.105 --> 00:19:30.905
It's not that bad.
Why do they call it Bitter-After?

00:19:31.545 --> 00:19:33.825
People in the old days
chose their words for a reason.

00:19:34.745 --> 00:19:36.785
Once you chew it, the stalk's gone

00:19:36.865 --> 00:19:39.465
and all that's left is the bitter taste.

00:19:40.105 --> 00:19:41.585
That's inauspicious.

00:19:42.185 --> 00:19:43.345
All right.

00:19:43.425 --> 00:19:45.625
Beyond here lies
the territory of Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:19:45.705 --> 00:19:47.225
I'll travel the rest of the path alone.

00:19:53.585 --> 00:19:58.185
Can you two not look so gloomy for once?

00:20:01.625 --> 00:20:04.585
Fine. What wishes do you both have?

00:20:05.385 --> 00:20:08.345
I won't die before I grant them.

00:20:09.385 --> 00:20:10.945
What wishes can I have?

00:20:11.025 --> 00:20:12.825
I just hope you get justice soon,

00:20:12.905 --> 00:20:16.145
reunite with Bai Wan, and enjoy calm days.

00:20:17.385 --> 00:20:18.265
Don't strain yourself.

00:20:19.145 --> 00:20:20.025
Same here.

00:20:20.105 --> 00:20:22.185
I don't expect
to be emperor when I return.

00:20:22.265 --> 00:20:24.305
I entrust my wishes to you.

00:20:26.265 --> 00:20:30.185
I hope you take revenge
and wipe out all of Huben,

00:20:31.425 --> 00:20:33.185
then live an ordinary, peaceful life.

00:20:37.705 --> 00:20:38.945
All right.

00:20:39.745 --> 00:20:42.585
I'll take your blessing. I'll be back.

00:21:34.425 --> 00:21:35.305
Halt.

00:21:39.785 --> 00:21:41.225
Wait for the contact.

00:22:08.705 --> 00:22:10.025
Make way.

00:22:21.105 --> 00:22:21.985
You're chewing the wrong end.

00:22:23.465 --> 00:22:25.345
The bottom part is the most bitter.

00:22:25.425 --> 00:22:26.985
What's that to you?

00:23:23.545 --> 00:23:25.145
You're busy this morning.

00:23:26.425 --> 00:23:27.985
It's becoming warmer.

00:23:28.065 --> 00:23:31.625
If I don't clean up soon,
these alleys will stink before long.

00:23:31.705 --> 00:23:34.105
There's no hurry.
Take your breakfast first.

00:23:35.465 --> 00:23:39.585
Di Lu, are you waiting for someone today?

00:23:39.665 --> 00:23:41.825
It's a newcomer.
I'm just about to fetch him.

00:23:47.585 --> 00:23:49.265
Why? Something wrong?

00:23:49.905 --> 00:23:51.905
Isn't there a general
locked up in the alley?

00:23:52.825 --> 00:23:56.985
Mr. Wang Pu warned us to stay alert.

00:23:57.585 --> 00:24:00.265
That general is a man of rank.
Someone might come to rescue him.

00:24:00.865 --> 00:24:04.145
Do check this newcomer carefully.

00:24:04.225 --> 00:24:06.265
How do I check him?
You're smarter than I am.

00:24:06.345 --> 00:24:08.145
I'll do whatever you tell me to do.

00:24:29.305 --> 00:24:32.385
He's been standing here long enough.
Hurry and take him away.

00:24:35.345 --> 00:24:36.425
Wang Xing?

00:24:38.465 --> 00:24:39.785
Come with me.

00:25:38.505 --> 00:25:41.065
Everyone, stop a moment.

00:25:41.145 --> 00:25:42.545
This is Wang Xing.

00:25:43.665 --> 00:25:46.745
Xing, what do you think of the paper?

00:25:54.265 --> 00:25:57.465
It's too thick, and the color is wrong.

00:26:11.145 --> 00:26:12.905
The pulp needs to be finer.

00:26:12.985 --> 00:26:14.705
Don't soak it too long.

00:26:14.785 --> 00:26:16.785
Or else, the paper will go too soft.

00:26:17.945 --> 00:26:20.425
Wang Xing. Our new fellow.

00:26:21.025 --> 00:26:23.425
He'll be in charge of
all travel permits here.

00:26:23.505 --> 00:26:25.265
Xing, work can wait.

00:26:25.345 --> 00:26:26.425
Come with me.

00:26:33.065 --> 00:26:36.785
The last man who did this job
was known as Ren.

00:26:36.865 --> 00:26:38.225
He died of illness last month.

00:26:38.305 --> 00:26:40.625
He lived here and worked here.

00:26:40.705 --> 00:26:41.745
Do you mind staying here?

00:26:42.785 --> 00:26:44.465
No. I'm fine with it.

00:26:45.545 --> 00:26:48.505
Good. Then this will be your station.

00:26:49.025 --> 00:26:51.265
Everyone outside
will follow your instructions.

00:26:52.385 --> 00:26:54.745
But some procedures can't be skipped.

00:26:54.825 --> 00:26:57.025
Show me your permit from the Capital.

00:26:57.105 --> 00:26:57.985
All right.

00:27:07.865 --> 00:27:08.785
TRAVEL PASS

00:27:17.625 --> 00:27:18.985
Check his travel pass.

00:27:19.065 --> 00:27:21.665
See when he set off and from where.

00:27:21.745 --> 00:27:24.785
Every prefecture and sub-prefecture
he passed has left its seal.

00:27:25.385 --> 00:27:27.145
Go through the seals one by one.

00:27:27.225 --> 00:27:29.745
If he arrived more or less on time,

00:27:29.825 --> 00:27:31.665
there should be no issue.

00:27:31.745 --> 00:27:35.025
But if the timing is far off, take heed.

00:27:41.545 --> 00:27:43.185
All right. I'll get to it.

00:27:49.545 --> 00:27:50.905
I just don't understand.

00:27:50.985 --> 00:27:54.865
You're so smart,
but you ended up collecting trash.

00:27:54.945 --> 00:27:56.545
What was Wang Pu thinking?

00:27:57.185 --> 00:27:59.745
You ask me? Who am I supposed to ask?

00:28:01.665 --> 00:28:02.905
THE EIGHTH DAY OF THE TWELFTH MONTH,
FOURTH YEAR OF WENCHENG

00:28:02.985 --> 00:28:03.825
CUI LUNIAN, INSPECTOR OF CHANG'AN

00:28:09.665 --> 00:28:11.025
Guards.

00:28:13.025 --> 00:28:16.865
You should've arrived three days ago.
The weather's been clear.

00:28:16.945 --> 00:28:18.785
Why are you late? Explain yourself.

00:28:20.425 --> 00:28:21.585
Answer the question.

00:28:21.665 --> 00:28:22.505
Speak.

00:28:38.265 --> 00:28:40.065
Where did you get this wound?

00:28:41.905 --> 00:28:45.145
I met a man on the road.

00:28:45.225 --> 00:28:47.505
He said he knew me
and forced me to forge a pass.

00:28:48.105 --> 00:28:50.545
I refused, and we fought.

00:28:51.145 --> 00:28:54.745
In the end, I stabbed him
a few times when he let his guard down

00:28:54.825 --> 00:28:55.665
and killed him.

00:28:56.945 --> 00:28:58.625
I fainted after that.

00:28:59.905 --> 00:29:03.985
That delayed my trip.

00:29:04.065 --> 00:29:07.465
Why didn't you report it?

00:29:08.065 --> 00:29:09.345
I didn't dare.

00:29:09.425 --> 00:29:10.505
Who did you kill?

00:29:14.025 --> 00:29:15.065
Liu Ziyan.

00:29:16.065 --> 00:29:18.705
You killed Liu Ziyan?

00:29:20.345 --> 00:29:23.785
He was the Huben Army's top killer.
You killed him?

00:29:26.665 --> 00:29:29.905
Di, I'm telling the truth.

00:29:30.425 --> 00:29:32.425
When I met him,

00:29:32.505 --> 00:29:36.265
he was badly wounded and nearly done for.

00:29:36.865 --> 00:29:38.505
How many times did you stab him?

00:29:38.585 --> 00:29:40.105
Where did you stab him?

00:29:40.985 --> 00:29:44.705
The first stab was aimed at his chest,

00:29:46.985 --> 00:29:49.065
but he grabbed my dagger.

00:29:49.705 --> 00:29:53.465
I pulled it out
and stabbed a few more times.

00:29:54.585 --> 00:29:56.185
I was afraid he'd survive.

00:29:56.985 --> 00:30:00.185
So maybe ten stabs.

00:30:00.945 --> 00:30:02.265
Where's the body?

00:30:03.105 --> 00:30:06.625
In the forest 30 li south of the city.

00:30:08.745 --> 00:30:10.345
I panicked

00:30:11.825 --> 00:30:14.905
and dumped the body before running.

00:30:16.945 --> 00:30:17.825
Watch him.

00:30:17.905 --> 00:30:19.065
I'll be back.

00:30:19.665 --> 00:30:20.585
Yes, sir.

00:30:42.585 --> 00:30:43.905
What?

00:30:43.985 --> 00:30:46.705
You hang around
that garbage collector all day

00:30:46.785 --> 00:30:48.185
and don't mind his stink,

00:30:48.265 --> 00:30:51.385
but when you're here, you're picky now?

00:30:51.465 --> 00:30:53.185
They smell completely different.

00:30:55.345 --> 00:30:57.145
How was it? Have you checked?

00:30:57.225 --> 00:30:58.585
How many wounds?

00:30:58.665 --> 00:31:01.185
I have. Eleven stab wounds.

00:31:01.265 --> 00:31:03.385
Done by two different groups.

00:31:03.465 --> 00:31:04.305
Here, look.

00:31:04.385 --> 00:31:06.545
These stabs have clean edges.

00:31:06.625 --> 00:31:08.505
The blade went in and out fast.

00:31:08.585 --> 00:31:09.705
Skilled hands.

00:31:09.785 --> 00:31:12.265
They should be from our people.

00:31:12.345 --> 00:31:14.785
As for these wounds, they're serious,

00:31:14.865 --> 00:31:17.345
but they avoided all the vital spots.

00:31:17.425 --> 00:31:19.865
The real fatal wounds are nine.

00:31:19.945 --> 00:31:23.585
Two to the chest,
the other seven to the abdomen.

00:31:23.665 --> 00:31:26.225
Judging by the cuts,
the stabs were forceful,

00:31:26.305 --> 00:31:27.545
but the depth varies.

00:31:27.625 --> 00:31:28.985
Their edges are rolled back.

00:31:29.065 --> 00:31:32.305
That means the blade
didn't go in or out cleanly.

00:31:34.545 --> 00:31:36.905
Whoever stabbed him meant to kill,

00:31:36.985 --> 00:31:39.825
but wasn't used to handling a weapon.

00:31:39.905 --> 00:31:43.745
As for the wound on the arm,
shallow inside and deep outside.

00:31:43.825 --> 00:31:46.025
Likely caused when he grabbed the blade

00:31:46.105 --> 00:31:48.105
as the attacker tried to pull it back.

00:31:49.465 --> 00:31:53.465
Could it have been staged after death?

00:31:54.345 --> 00:31:56.145
A dead man can't grab anything.

00:31:56.225 --> 00:32:00.145
Someone would've had to
press his hand onto the blade.

00:32:00.225 --> 00:32:03.065
But if so, the force wouldn't be even.

00:32:03.145 --> 00:32:06.465
Therefore, you wouldn't
get such a clean cut.

00:32:20.345 --> 00:32:21.505
Carry on.

00:32:21.585 --> 00:32:23.105
Keep writing. I'm just looking.

00:32:24.985 --> 00:32:28.985
BY GUO ZI'AN

00:32:29.065 --> 00:32:30.985
Your handwriting looks good.

00:32:31.065 --> 00:32:32.185
Impressive.

00:32:32.265 --> 00:32:34.705
You're way better than Ren.

00:32:36.345 --> 00:32:37.265
Di.

00:32:37.905 --> 00:32:39.345
-You…
-Sit.

00:32:39.425 --> 00:32:40.505
Don't be nervous.

00:32:41.105 --> 00:32:44.385
I came here to apologize.

00:32:44.985 --> 00:32:47.185
I was too rash before.

00:32:47.265 --> 00:32:50.345
I'd like to buy you a drink
and dinner tonight

00:32:50.425 --> 00:32:51.585
to calm your nerves.

00:32:53.585 --> 00:32:54.625
What do you think?

00:32:54.705 --> 00:32:56.985
-I told you I'm fine.
-Yes.

00:32:57.065 --> 00:32:58.425
More than fine.

00:32:58.985 --> 00:33:00.105
You even killed Liu Ziyan.

00:33:00.745 --> 00:33:03.745
That was something many wanted
but couldn't do.

00:33:03.825 --> 00:33:05.665
Xing, you've got both brains and brawn.

00:33:05.745 --> 00:33:06.865
You have a bright future.

00:33:07.985 --> 00:33:10.265
Whether I have a future isn't the point.

00:33:10.345 --> 00:33:14.465
What matters is I didn't lose my life.

00:33:15.345 --> 00:33:17.025
What kind of talk is that?

00:33:17.625 --> 00:33:18.745
All right then.

00:33:18.825 --> 00:33:20.425
See you at the mutton-soup stall tonight.

00:33:20.505 --> 00:33:22.825
I'll buy you a good drink.

00:33:22.905 --> 00:33:24.385
I think I'll pass.

00:33:24.465 --> 00:33:25.665
It's settled.

00:33:25.745 --> 00:33:27.865
I'll introduce you to a friend.

00:33:28.745 --> 00:33:30.505
I've prepared a gift for you.

00:33:31.145 --> 00:33:32.305
You'll like it.

00:33:33.225 --> 00:33:35.425
All right. See you tonight.

00:33:35.505 --> 00:33:37.705
I'll hurry and finish this work.

00:33:38.345 --> 00:33:39.265
Go on with your tasks.

00:34:10.145 --> 00:34:11.705
I told you.

00:34:12.545 --> 00:34:15.505
You're different from the rest of them.

00:34:28.985 --> 00:34:31.784
How am I supposed to eat it
when you put it on the ground?

00:34:32.744 --> 00:34:35.385
How about this, lad? Put it on my leg.

00:34:41.585 --> 00:34:43.145
Leave the rest to me.

00:34:43.225 --> 00:34:44.585
On your leg?

00:34:45.705 --> 00:34:49.225
After I leave,
you'll find a way to drop the bowl,

00:34:49.945 --> 00:34:53.065
break it, take a shard,

00:34:53.145 --> 00:34:55.985
cut the rope, and escape.

00:34:57.545 --> 00:34:59.305
I pity you,

00:35:00.505 --> 00:35:01.905
but I'm no fool.

00:35:04.905 --> 00:35:08.865
Lad, I can't reach the bowl.

00:35:09.665 --> 00:35:10.905
Think of something yourself.

00:35:12.225 --> 00:35:16.385
You can lean your whole body over,

00:35:16.465 --> 00:35:20.505
then press your face
to the ground, like a dog.

00:35:21.545 --> 00:35:22.745
I've done it before.

00:35:25.105 --> 00:35:26.425
You can do the same.

00:35:51.985 --> 00:35:52.985
Wang Xing.

00:35:54.825 --> 00:35:57.945
There are two people
in Hidden Soldier Alley you must befriend.

00:35:58.545 --> 00:36:01.825
Do you mean General Fengshan?

00:36:02.425 --> 00:36:04.745
I've never even met him.

00:36:05.585 --> 00:36:08.385
The first is Li Sangeng.

00:36:08.465 --> 00:36:10.825
The calmest man in Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:36:11.665 --> 00:36:14.265
I noticed your travel pass
was overdue by three days

00:36:14.345 --> 00:36:16.425
because he reminded me.

00:36:16.505 --> 00:36:18.985
If you didn't say it,
he'd never know it was my idea.

00:36:19.665 --> 00:36:21.745
What? You hold a dagger to his neck,

00:36:21.825 --> 00:36:23.425
and try to blame it on me?

00:36:24.145 --> 00:36:26.385
That's all in the past now.

00:36:27.185 --> 00:36:29.665
Exactly. It's all in the past.
No need to bring up old matters.

00:36:31.585 --> 00:36:34.665
The second person is me. Di Lu.

00:36:35.265 --> 00:36:37.385
The warmest man in Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:36:37.465 --> 00:36:39.705
Everyone here is my friend.

00:36:40.305 --> 00:36:42.865
If you ever need anything,
just give me a shout.

00:36:43.905 --> 00:36:45.665
Sure. Thank you, Di.

00:36:46.705 --> 00:36:48.345
Don't be so courteous.

00:36:48.425 --> 00:36:50.665
The more you thank me,
the more long-winded it sounds.

00:36:52.865 --> 00:36:54.025
Wang,

00:36:54.105 --> 00:36:57.665
care to tell us
what kind of person you are?

00:36:59.705 --> 00:37:01.745
Just get him drunk, and you'll find out.

00:37:01.825 --> 00:37:04.745
No. I'm not a good drinker.

00:37:05.665 --> 00:37:08.065
Just like Di said,

00:37:08.625 --> 00:37:11.185
I'm probably the luckiest man
in Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:37:11.825 --> 00:37:15.905
After all, I faced Liu Ziyan
and lived to tell the tale.

00:37:16.785 --> 00:37:17.985
Liu Ziyan?

00:37:19.305 --> 00:37:22.465
Speaking of him,
I must pour a cup for you.

00:37:23.705 --> 00:37:24.785
Here, Wang Xing.

00:37:27.465 --> 00:37:30.185
Who would've thought
that after Liu Ziyan was gravely injured,

00:37:30.265 --> 00:37:33.505
he happened to run into you,
happened to know you,

00:37:34.385 --> 00:37:35.625
and forced you to forge a pass?

00:37:40.945 --> 00:37:42.505
Sangeng, the cup is full.

00:37:45.505 --> 00:37:47.105
What a coincidence.

00:37:47.785 --> 00:37:51.065
I wouldn't believe it
unless I saw it with my own eyes.

00:37:55.745 --> 00:37:58.825
Sangeng, I know you're cautious,

00:37:58.905 --> 00:38:00.905
but I've looked into it.

00:38:00.985 --> 00:38:03.025
Stop being so suspicious.

00:38:03.105 --> 00:38:04.625
Come on. Sit.

00:38:05.705 --> 00:38:08.105
He's like that.

00:38:08.185 --> 00:38:11.185
He sees enemies even in a pile of garbage.
Don't blame him.

00:38:11.985 --> 00:38:13.785
You two have a toast,
and let this matter rest.

00:38:14.385 --> 00:38:16.905
It's all in the past. Come on.

00:38:16.985 --> 00:38:19.905
Sangeng, if you need
a travel pass, come to me.

00:38:20.665 --> 00:38:22.985
If there's garbage, I'll take it.

00:38:24.825 --> 00:38:28.585
Xing, don't blame me for that day.

00:38:29.625 --> 00:38:30.905
I was just scared.

00:38:31.505 --> 00:38:33.945
The Huben Army
is like rats in the street now.

00:38:34.025 --> 00:38:36.225
I have to keep my eyes open.

00:38:37.265 --> 00:38:40.145
That's enough.
You're drunk. Don't talk nonsense.

00:38:41.665 --> 00:38:43.145
You don't understand.

00:38:44.225 --> 00:38:49.185
The Huben Army was glorious once,
back when General Liu was still alive.

00:38:49.825 --> 00:38:51.425
Not anymore.

00:38:51.505 --> 00:38:54.825
General Fengshan wants to push for reform.
That's a great undertaking.

00:38:54.905 --> 00:38:56.505
I can't help with anything.

00:38:57.225 --> 00:39:00.745
I'm just afraid
that one day this alley will be raided,

00:39:01.705 --> 00:39:05.305
and every Huben member
won't be able to escape.

00:39:05.905 --> 00:39:10.425
I only hope
they can live just one more day.

00:39:12.105 --> 00:39:13.265
Come. Drink.

00:39:43.065 --> 00:39:45.305
Huainan is good

00:39:45.385 --> 00:39:47.585
A safe haven

00:39:47.665 --> 00:39:52.105
The mountains and rivers
Stretch on like our affection

00:39:52.185 --> 00:39:57.105
A devoted soul sings here

00:39:57.185 --> 00:40:02.105
I brave the snow to see you off

00:40:02.185 --> 00:40:06.505
I await your return
Though my temples may turn to frost

00:40:07.105 --> 00:40:10.865
My devotion endures
As long as water flows

00:40:12.425 --> 00:40:15.345
Am I the one drunk,
or are both of you drunk?

00:40:15.425 --> 00:40:17.105
My place is over this side.

00:40:17.185 --> 00:40:19.105
-This way.
-Let's go.

00:40:19.185 --> 00:40:20.225
Di,

00:40:21.945 --> 00:40:25.305
why are you suddenly singing this tune?

00:40:25.385 --> 00:40:28.865
It doesn't sound like
a tune from Chang'an.

00:40:29.705 --> 00:40:32.505
I used to know someone

00:40:33.105 --> 00:40:36.865
who lived in the place
from this song, Huainan.

00:40:38.105 --> 00:40:41.305
I used to deliver messages for him.

00:40:41.385 --> 00:40:44.665
I had to go
to this remote village every time.

00:40:44.745 --> 00:40:46.065
It was exhausting.

00:40:47.305 --> 00:40:51.145
Then, word came
from above that he'd betrayed us.

00:40:51.745 --> 00:40:54.065
I was given the task to kill him.

00:40:54.825 --> 00:40:58.585
But when I got there,
there wasn't even a trace of him.

00:41:02.225 --> 00:41:05.785
Only those who've died once
can be truly free.

00:41:06.825 --> 00:41:08.145
To be honest,

00:41:09.505 --> 00:41:13.905
before he turned against us,
I actually liked him.

00:41:16.265 --> 00:41:19.105
Di, why did you try to kill him?

00:41:26.985 --> 00:41:27.905
Xing,

00:41:29.785 --> 00:41:35.985
liking someone
has nothing to do with killing them.

00:41:36.665 --> 00:41:41.545
In the end, the only person
you can afford to like is yourself.

00:41:42.145 --> 00:41:45.385
Keeping yourself alive
matters more than anything.

00:41:45.985 --> 00:41:48.025
If I didn't take the job,

00:41:48.865 --> 00:41:50.905
I'd be the one dead.

00:41:56.425 --> 00:41:58.305
I haven't had enough.

00:41:58.385 --> 00:42:00.385
Come to my place and let's drink more.

00:42:00.465 --> 00:42:01.585
Let's drink more.

00:42:03.145 --> 00:42:04.385
This is it.

00:42:06.065 --> 00:42:08.025
Sangeng, bring the liquor.

00:42:08.105 --> 00:42:09.465
-Over there.
-That's enough.

00:42:09.545 --> 00:42:11.585
You're plastered.

00:42:11.665 --> 00:42:13.185
-Come. Careful.
-Liquor.

00:42:20.865 --> 00:42:21.985
I should get going.

00:42:22.785 --> 00:42:24.345
Don't go.

00:42:24.425 --> 00:42:25.665
Let's drink some more.

00:42:25.745 --> 00:42:28.185
It's rare for us to be this happy.

00:42:28.265 --> 00:42:30.105
You're an interesting man.

00:42:30.185 --> 00:42:32.065
Let's drink. Come on.

00:42:32.145 --> 00:42:33.145
Maybe not today.

00:42:33.225 --> 00:42:34.545
Your head will hurt tomorrow.

00:42:34.625 --> 00:42:37.905
-Drink some water.
-I don't want water. I want liquor.

00:42:43.545 --> 00:42:48.265
Xing, I prepared a gift for you.

00:42:48.345 --> 00:42:50.185
Drink a little more with me.

00:42:50.265 --> 00:42:52.665
If not, I'll give it to someone else.

00:42:53.465 --> 00:42:56.345
Sangeng, you too. Drink with us.

00:42:56.945 --> 00:42:59.425
Let me tell you. I…

00:43:24.945 --> 00:43:25.985
Xing,

00:43:27.105 --> 00:43:30.025
when did you get that wound?

00:43:44.065 --> 00:43:47.185
Liu Ziyan stabbed someone recently.

00:43:47.865 --> 00:43:51.985
It was a man
the Huben Army had been ordered to kill.

00:43:52.065 --> 00:43:56.825
I heard the blade
was driven in from the neck.

00:43:57.665 --> 00:44:00.505
It was the right side of the neck.

00:44:19.985 --> 00:44:22.225
You almost had me there.

00:45:29.625 --> 00:45:32.825
Good thing you're here tonight,
Han Ziling.
