00:00:57.621 --> 00:00:58.439
Ms. Wi!

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.539
Ms. Wi!

00:01:00.457 --> 00:01:01.375
Hello.

00:01:02.918 --> 00:01:04.503
Hello.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.255
What brings you here?

00:01:08.507 --> 00:01:10.301
Oh, I had some business to handle.

00:01:14.138 --> 00:01:17.141
If you're done eating,
would you like to have tea with me?

00:01:18.017 --> 00:01:19.059
I…

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.440
Shall we?

00:01:28.652 --> 00:01:29.695
I'll join.

00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:35.868
Me too.

00:01:36.493 --> 00:01:38.078
I'll join too.

00:02:15.074 --> 00:02:16.659
Let's sit over here.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.375
Here you go.

00:02:44.645 --> 00:02:46.647
The weather is so nice today.

00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:53.445
-What would you like to drink?
-I'll have an iced Americano.

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:55.572
I'll have a hot Americano.

00:02:55.656 --> 00:02:56.532
And you, Mr. Lee?

00:02:56.615 --> 00:02:58.158
He'll have peppermint tea.

00:02:58.826 --> 00:03:00.577
You don't drink coffee
in the afternoon, right?

00:03:02.121 --> 00:03:03.664
Yes, I'll have a peppermint tea.

00:03:03.747 --> 00:03:04.915
Okay.

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:05.916
I'll go and order.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.126
-No, I'll do it.
-I will.

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.712
She'd feel uncomfortable
if her boss tagged along.

00:03:10.796 --> 00:03:12.840
-Go, now.
-Right.

00:03:12.923 --> 00:03:14.299
I'll go instead.

00:03:14.383 --> 00:03:15.300
Wait.

00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:17.970
I'd feel uncomfortable with an actor too.

00:03:19.596 --> 00:03:20.431
I'll go by myself.

00:03:36.113 --> 00:03:38.741
I gave you the chance on a silver platter.
What more can I do for you?

00:03:39.324 --> 00:03:41.910
But she said going with an actor
would be just as uncomfortable.

00:03:46.498 --> 00:03:47.499
Go now.

00:03:48.083 --> 00:03:49.168
Okay.

00:03:51.378 --> 00:03:53.380
-Be careful.
-Thank you so much.

00:03:56.967 --> 00:03:58.218
Here's your peppermint tea, Mr. Lee.

00:04:00.137 --> 00:04:01.305
Me first?

00:04:01.388 --> 00:04:02.389
Thank you.

00:04:08.604 --> 00:04:09.438
Thank you.

00:04:36.673 --> 00:04:38.050
The weather sure is nice.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.512
You've said that so many times.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.732
These flowers are called anemones.

00:04:53.816 --> 00:04:56.693
I heard they symbolize hopeless love.

00:04:59.154 --> 00:05:00.280
And they smell…

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:03.992
enchantingly sweet.

00:05:08.288 --> 00:05:09.248
So sweet.

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.130
How do you know such things?

00:05:18.298 --> 00:05:19.967
Because Kang Pil-gu likes flowers.

00:05:20.634 --> 00:05:23.470
You really must be a fan
to know that about him.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.681
Chief.

00:05:25.764 --> 00:05:27.933
So please take good care of Ms. Wi.

00:05:28.016 --> 00:05:29.101
Of course.

00:05:29.184 --> 00:05:31.979
I'll take good care of Ms. Wi.

00:05:33.063 --> 00:05:35.649
Didn't you win
the Korean Journalist of the Year award?

00:05:36.859 --> 00:05:40.279
I'm sure you'll be fine
without anyone's help.

00:05:40.362 --> 00:05:43.157
-Right?
-Yes, of course.

00:05:49.788 --> 00:05:50.622
Onion!

00:05:59.882 --> 00:06:01.341
Chief, do you use Onion too?

00:06:01.425 --> 00:06:04.094
Of course. It's a must if you have kids.

00:06:04.178 --> 00:06:08.348
You need it to buy and sell
barely used book sets or toys.

00:06:08.432 --> 00:06:10.684
What is this "Onion"?

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.439
I've used Onion before.

00:06:15.522 --> 00:06:17.649
Ms. Wi, have you used it before?

00:06:17.733 --> 00:06:19.067
I use it pretty often.

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:21.695
What did you buy most recently?

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:24.781
Well, I got a TV for free

00:06:24.865 --> 00:06:27.075
-and bought a few necessities.
-I see.

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:29.286
So what exactly is Onion?

00:06:31.705 --> 00:06:33.498
It's a secondhand selling app.

00:06:33.582 --> 00:06:34.833
Like an online flea market.

00:06:34.917 --> 00:06:35.959
I see.

00:06:37.586 --> 00:06:40.505
You wouldn't know
since you were born with a silver spoon.

00:06:42.174 --> 00:06:43.675
There are all sorts of apps out there.

00:06:44.384 --> 00:06:48.222
I hear people meet each other
through dating apps too.

00:06:48.305 --> 00:06:51.642
Some meet on apps, go on dates,
and even get married.

00:06:51.725 --> 00:06:53.143
Think of it as having

00:06:53.227 --> 00:06:56.230
a pen pal but in modern times.

00:06:56.313 --> 00:06:57.439
Some of them are jerks

00:06:57.522 --> 00:06:59.816
who hide behind their screens
and toy with your emotions.

00:07:00.317 --> 00:07:02.194
Tons of people do that
even after meeting in person.

00:07:02.277 --> 00:07:03.570
Imagine how much worse it is online.

00:07:04.988 --> 00:07:07.991
You shouldn't even think about
meeting people anonymously.

00:07:08.075 --> 00:07:09.159
You're right.

00:07:09.243 --> 00:07:10.118
I agree.

00:07:10.202 --> 00:07:13.372
I disagree. Weird people exist everywhere.

00:07:13.455 --> 00:07:17.167
It's a leap to assume
people like that exist only on apps.

00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:21.004
Don't you think some of those people

00:07:21.088 --> 00:07:24.383
have reasons they're unable to share?

00:07:24.967 --> 00:07:25.926
Right?

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.427
Right.

00:07:27.511 --> 00:07:31.390
I assume married people
who sign up and pretend to be single

00:07:31.932 --> 00:07:33.600
wouldn't be able to share their stories.

00:07:33.684 --> 00:07:35.686
No, even on those apps,

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.563
it's possible for people

00:07:39.106 --> 00:07:40.565
to really like someone.

00:07:42.067 --> 00:07:43.026
Don't you agree?

00:07:44.027 --> 00:07:46.321
-Move already.
-No, you go.

00:07:46.405 --> 00:07:47.531
Why do I have to go?

00:07:47.614 --> 00:07:48.824
Hey, it's Kang Pil-gu.

00:07:48.907 --> 00:07:50.784
-It's Kang Pil-gu!
-Let's get a photo.

00:07:51.743 --> 00:07:53.161
-Sorry, sir.
-Can we get a photo?

00:07:53.245 --> 00:07:54.997
-Sure, come here.
-I'm a big fan.

00:07:55.747 --> 00:07:56.707
I love your show.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:58.792
-Can I get an autograph too?
-Okay.

00:07:58.875 --> 00:08:00.669
We need a record
of this historical moment.

00:08:02.587 --> 00:08:03.797
One, two, three.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.756
What a great photo.

00:08:08.719 --> 00:08:09.553
Ms. Wi,

00:08:09.636 --> 00:08:11.555
if you're going back to the office,
why don't you ride with me?

00:08:11.638 --> 00:08:14.224
-I…
-Don't you have business in Gangnam?

00:08:16.184 --> 00:08:17.227
Yes.

00:08:17.811 --> 00:08:19.563
I'm going back to the office,
so I'll take your ride.

00:08:26.987 --> 00:08:30.115
Well, I'm going to Gangnam,

00:08:30.198 --> 00:08:31.533
so I'll take you there.

00:08:31.616 --> 00:08:32.784
No, that's okay.

00:08:32.868 --> 00:08:34.077
-It's okay.
-No, thank you.

00:08:40.792 --> 00:08:41.626
No, I'm fine.

00:08:49.384 --> 00:08:50.761
EPISODE 11

00:08:56.683 --> 00:08:57.642
Why are you driving yourself?

00:08:58.643 --> 00:08:59.978
I didn't think you'd want to

00:09:00.896 --> 00:09:02.230
get behind the wheel again.

00:09:02.314 --> 00:09:04.316
I can't quit driving
just because I was in an accident.

00:09:06.693 --> 00:09:07.944
Yes, you can.

00:09:08.528 --> 00:09:09.946
I'll drive for you.

00:09:15.369 --> 00:09:16.828
Lim Hyeon-jun and Wi Jeong-sin

00:09:17.454 --> 00:09:18.580
look quite good together, right?

00:09:24.544 --> 00:09:26.463
Are you saying the person Ms. Wi likes

00:09:27.381 --> 00:09:28.882
is Lim Hyeon-jun?

00:09:29.716 --> 00:09:31.718
I didn't look into it that far,

00:09:32.344 --> 00:09:33.178
but I can ask her.

00:09:33.261 --> 00:09:34.429
Forget it.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.932
Don't bother asking her.

00:09:45.982 --> 00:09:49.569
Why does Mr. Lee keep coming on to you?

00:09:49.653 --> 00:09:50.862
Come on to me?

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.990
Why would you
disrespect his feelings like that?

00:09:55.992 --> 00:09:57.744
Are you taking his side?

00:09:57.828 --> 00:09:59.246
I'm not taking his side.

00:09:59.329 --> 00:10:01.540
You could've just said,
"I think he likes you."

00:10:01.623 --> 00:10:03.250
Did he say he liked you?

00:10:03.792 --> 00:10:05.752
Did he confess his feelings or something?

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.754
Don't get carried away.

00:10:08.922 --> 00:10:11.133
So he did. I can tell that he did.

00:10:11.216 --> 00:10:12.759
So did you return his feelings?

00:10:12.843 --> 00:10:14.010
What's the matter with you?

00:10:14.511 --> 00:10:15.971
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun, do you like me?

00:10:19.683 --> 00:10:21.560
I like someone else.

00:10:22.102 --> 00:10:23.687
And I'm still not over him.

00:10:24.521 --> 00:10:25.730
There's another guy?

00:10:25.814 --> 00:10:26.982
What do you mean "another"?

00:10:27.065 --> 00:10:30.777
Wow, you sure are a complicated woman.

00:10:31.361 --> 00:10:32.487
So complicated.

00:10:32.571 --> 00:10:33.572
What are you talking about?

00:10:51.131 --> 00:10:52.215
So where are you going?

00:10:52.966 --> 00:10:54.426
Why did you get out?

00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:55.343
What?

00:10:55.427 --> 00:10:57.679
People are recognizing you. Get back in.

00:10:57.762 --> 00:11:00.724
If they recognize me, then so be it.
Who cares?

00:11:00.807 --> 00:11:02.476
Are you worried a rumor might break out?

00:11:03.393 --> 00:11:04.686
I never said that.

00:11:06.062 --> 00:11:07.606
If a rumor spreads, then be it.

00:11:07.689 --> 00:11:09.107
Can't I even date at my age?

00:11:09.191 --> 00:11:11.109
But we're not dating!

00:11:13.028 --> 00:11:15.197
Anyway, who are you meeting today?

00:11:15.864 --> 00:11:17.199
An actor? Or a singer?

00:11:18.575 --> 00:11:21.036
If it's an actor, I can help you out.

00:11:21.119 --> 00:11:21.995
It's not an actor.

00:11:22.787 --> 00:11:24.831
Anyway, thank you for the ride. Goodbye.

00:11:24.915 --> 00:11:25.749
Wait.

00:11:26.333 --> 00:11:27.542
Ms. Wi…

00:11:29.211 --> 00:11:30.670
Jeez.

00:11:33.882 --> 00:11:35.800
-I'm a huge fan!
-Me too!

00:11:35.884 --> 00:11:37.594
This is amazing!

00:11:39.262 --> 00:11:40.639
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

00:11:40.722 --> 00:11:43.558
-We love you!
-We love you!

00:11:43.642 --> 00:11:46.520
-Love you!
-Thank you!

00:11:46.603 --> 00:11:49.397
I'll get a 15 cm Italian BMT

00:11:49.481 --> 00:11:51.233
-with the recommended combo.
-Sure.

00:11:52.317 --> 00:11:55.237
By the way, is the owner here?

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.072
She stepped out for a minute.

00:11:57.155 --> 00:11:58.865
I see. Thank you.

00:12:07.999 --> 00:12:09.543
I already ate, but I can still eat this.

00:12:11.253 --> 00:12:12.128
This is good.

00:12:24.474 --> 00:12:25.392
Hello.

00:12:33.525 --> 00:12:34.401
This sandwich is good.

00:12:34.484 --> 00:12:37.237
That's good to hear.
So what brings you here?

00:12:39.239 --> 00:12:40.991
I came to ask you something.

00:12:41.616 --> 00:12:45.537
I recall Mr. Woo Young-suk's parents
had passed away,

00:12:46.329 --> 00:12:48.540
but he did have a living older brother.

00:12:48.623 --> 00:12:50.542
-Yes, that's right.
-Do you still keep in touch?

00:12:50.625 --> 00:12:51.918
No, hardly.

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.546
We only speak when it's nearing
my husband's memorial day.

00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:57.424
But he really supported us
whenever things were looking tough.

00:12:58.174 --> 00:13:00.677
It sounds like the brother's well-off.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.762
We started out
in similar financial situations,

00:13:02.846 --> 00:13:05.265
but his restaurant business took off,
and he's doing well now.

00:13:05.849 --> 00:13:07.100
I haven't been there myself, though.

00:13:08.393 --> 00:13:12.689
Do you happen to know
where his restaurant is?

00:13:15.942 --> 00:13:17.861
He owns a place like this in Gangnam?

00:13:21.406 --> 00:13:22.324
Hello.

00:13:25.452 --> 00:13:27.495
I have a quick question.

00:13:27.579 --> 00:13:31.666
About that Cheongdam restaurant building
near the intersection.

00:13:32.417 --> 00:13:33.335
How much is it worth?

00:13:33.418 --> 00:13:35.211
-The building with the clock?
-Yes.

00:13:35.295 --> 00:13:38.089
It's worth about 40 billion won,
at the very least.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.216
Did you say 40 billion won?

00:13:40.759 --> 00:13:41.593
Yes.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:43.754

REVIEW REQUESTED CERTIFICATE

00:13:55.231 --> 00:13:56.149
What?

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.902
MORTGAGE REGISTRATION

00:13:58.985 --> 00:14:00.695
MORTGAGE LISTED AS ITEM 3 RELEASED

00:14:00.779 --> 00:14:02.864
He bought the building entirely in cash,

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:04.908
without taking out any loans.

00:14:18.338 --> 00:14:19.172
LEE DAE-HO, THE ENTERTAINMENT GIANT

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:26.429
You probably didn't know
since you were new to the political desk,

00:14:26.513 --> 00:14:28.556
but there was a rumor at the time

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.434
that Assemblyman Ha received land
from Lee Dae-ho under a borrowed name.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.654
So Lee Dae-ho bought land
under a borrowed name for Assemblyman Ha,

00:14:42.737 --> 00:14:44.698
but Ha Gee-wan doesn't have any assets
under his own name.

00:14:44.781 --> 00:14:46.991
His aide at the time died,

00:14:47.075 --> 00:14:49.369
and the aide's older brother
suddenly became filthy rich.

00:14:52.038 --> 00:14:53.081
What's going on?

00:15:05.802 --> 00:15:07.137
-Mr. Lim?
-Huh?

00:15:07.721 --> 00:15:08.847
Oh, Director Bak.

00:15:12.934 --> 00:15:13.852
Where are you coming from?

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:16.312
Open the door.

00:15:17.981 --> 00:15:19.983
What brings you to my studio at this hour?

00:15:20.066 --> 00:15:21.151
Nothing much.

00:15:21.735 --> 00:15:24.320
I was in the neighborhood,
so I just stopped by.

00:15:24.404 --> 00:15:25.613
Would you like some tea?

00:15:25.697 --> 00:15:27.323
No, I'm okay.

00:15:28.575 --> 00:15:32.120
You see, I was wondering…

00:15:32.203 --> 00:15:35.498
if you could revise the part
about Kang Pil-gu becoming corrupt

00:15:35.582 --> 00:15:38.334
just a tiny bit?

00:15:39.502 --> 00:15:41.087
Have you read episodes nine and ten?

00:15:41.171 --> 00:15:42.881
Right, episodes nine and ten.

00:15:42.964 --> 00:15:45.008
Those were fun.
You did a great job writing.

00:15:45.633 --> 00:15:47.427
-Good work, so--
-That's good to hear.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.429
Two more episodes to go,
and then it'll be over.

00:15:49.512 --> 00:15:51.264
Well, before it ends…

00:15:51.347 --> 00:15:52.223
Oh, right.

00:15:52.307 --> 00:15:53.808
You know the date's been set for
our production press conference, right?

00:15:53.892 --> 00:15:57.187
Oh, the date's been set
for the production press conference?

00:16:01.274 --> 00:16:02.525
The production press conference?

00:16:02.609 --> 00:16:03.485
Yes.

00:16:04.444 --> 00:16:05.779
Wait, are you going?

00:16:05.862 --> 00:16:06.696
What?

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:08.239
I'm the director,
so of course I'll be going.

00:16:08.323 --> 00:16:10.074
Come on, think about it!

00:16:10.158 --> 00:16:11.826
Every entertainment reporter
will be there!

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.829
We can't tell them not to come!
What are we going to do?

00:16:14.913 --> 00:16:15.789
Of course, the reporters will…

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:18.124
Ms. Wi Jeong-sin!

00:16:18.208 --> 00:16:20.585
That's right! Man, what do we do?

00:16:21.503 --> 00:16:23.087
-Then…
-Melomaster!

00:16:24.547 --> 00:16:25.673
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:16:26.633 --> 00:16:28.134
Oh, right.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.179
-Yes.
-I have a question, Melomaster.

00:16:33.097 --> 00:16:36.142
Who's the real Melomaster?

00:16:40.772 --> 00:16:41.940
No!

00:16:42.023 --> 00:16:45.068
Mr. Lim, what should we do?
We need to come up with a plan.

00:16:45.151 --> 00:16:46.820
Of course, we need a plan!

00:16:46.903 --> 00:16:48.071
Hurry and think of something.

00:16:50.532 --> 00:16:51.366
I've got an idea!

00:16:51.449 --> 00:16:54.786
How about we hold
the production press conference

00:16:54.869 --> 00:16:56.287
online instead?

00:16:56.371 --> 00:16:57.580
Hey, that's a good idea.

00:16:57.664 --> 00:16:59.457
Right, as if people
won't still see my face.

00:16:59.541 --> 00:17:03.002
Reporters will be watching
and writing articles in real time.

00:17:03.086 --> 00:17:04.546
That won't work then.

00:17:05.547 --> 00:17:06.589
How about this?

00:17:06.673 --> 00:17:08.424
You can disguise yourself
as an old man like last time.

00:17:08.508 --> 00:17:09.759
Great idea!

00:17:09.843 --> 00:17:11.177
I can't do that, Mr. Hwang.

00:17:11.261 --> 00:17:13.513
That's not something
anyone should do twice!

00:17:13.596 --> 00:17:15.723
Then what are we supposed to do?

00:17:15.807 --> 00:17:17.475
Byeong-gi, you're a writer.

00:17:17.559 --> 00:17:20.436
I'm sure you can come up
with a brilliant idea.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.272
Just think of something!

00:17:22.355 --> 00:17:24.232
It's hard enough writing scripts.

00:17:24.315 --> 00:17:27.193
Why should I have to worry about this
on top of everything else?

00:17:27.277 --> 00:17:29.821
How did I get caught up in this mess?

00:17:29.904 --> 00:17:31.948
Byeong-gi, you can do this.

00:17:32.031 --> 00:17:34.117
Just squeeze something out.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.660
How about a twin concept?

00:17:36.661 --> 00:17:37.662
What?

00:17:38.246 --> 00:17:41.708
I told her my name was Bak Jun-gi
that night at the N Seoul Tower.

00:17:41.791 --> 00:17:43.626
Bak Byeong-gi and Bak Jun-gi.

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.045
If I get caught,
I'll tell her that he's my twin brother.

00:17:46.129 --> 00:17:47.463
That sounds like a plan, right?

00:17:47.547 --> 00:17:49.632
Hey, Director Bak!

00:17:50.174 --> 00:17:51.426
You're a damn genius!

00:17:51.509 --> 00:17:52.677
-Right?
-Yes!

00:17:54.262 --> 00:17:55.805
This is it!

00:17:55.889 --> 00:17:56.890
Hey!

00:17:57.599 --> 00:18:00.727
If you do that,
you two will end up on the news.

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:02.395
How will you deal with the aftermath?

00:18:02.478 --> 00:18:03.771
She's a reporter.

00:18:03.855 --> 00:18:06.024
If you mess with her, she'll destroy you!

00:18:07.275 --> 00:18:08.902
He's got a point there.

00:18:08.985 --> 00:18:11.529
Yes, he does.
I think I lost my mind for a second.

00:18:12.739 --> 00:18:14.449
It won't work, Mr. Lim.

00:18:14.532 --> 00:18:16.993
Then what are we supposed to do?

00:18:20.997 --> 00:18:22.790
Director Bak.

00:18:22.874 --> 00:18:24.667
What is it?

00:18:24.751 --> 00:18:26.836
At first glance,

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:31.007
fame might appear to be a good thing,

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.384
but once your face becomes known,

00:18:33.468 --> 00:18:35.511
your private life is over.

00:18:35.595 --> 00:18:37.513
You know what I mean, Director Bak.

00:18:37.597 --> 00:18:40.558
I can't enjoy a meal in peace
when I'm out.

00:18:40.642 --> 00:18:43.436
What does that have to do
with the production press release?

00:18:44.103 --> 00:18:45.730
I'm just saying

00:18:45.813 --> 00:18:49.192
that it's best to be rich
and not be famous.

00:18:49.275 --> 00:18:52.028
Stop beating around the bush
and just say it.

00:18:52.111 --> 00:18:54.072
You don't want him
to attend the press conference.

00:18:54.155 --> 00:18:56.574
No, that's not it.

00:18:56.658 --> 00:19:00.161
I'm just saying
that instead of being somewhat famous,

00:19:01.162 --> 00:19:03.081
keeping a mysterious image

00:19:04.624 --> 00:19:09.337
and remaining a veiled, genius director

00:19:10.922 --> 00:19:14.133
may be an option for you.

00:19:14.217 --> 00:19:16.010
Mr. Lim, you're so selfish.

00:19:16.094 --> 00:19:18.429
Are you trying to block my career
because of your love life?

00:19:18.513 --> 00:19:21.265
I don't want to be forced
to stay an unveiled director.

00:19:22.475 --> 00:19:24.811
Who said anything
about blocking your career?

00:19:24.894 --> 00:19:26.896
You got it all wrong.

00:19:28.356 --> 00:19:29.399
Wait.

00:19:31.317 --> 00:19:34.112
What if we don't hold
a production press conference at all?

00:19:34.904 --> 00:19:36.030
Huh?

00:19:36.114 --> 00:19:37.573
I pray that we don't.

00:19:38.741 --> 00:19:42.036
Why do we have to do it
in the first place?

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.706
There's nothing wrong with not doing it.

00:20:11.399 --> 00:20:15.111
These flowers are called anemones.

00:20:15.194 --> 00:20:18.698
I heard they symbolize hopeless love.

00:20:20.742 --> 00:20:23.369
And they smell enchantingly sweet.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.166
Why am I here?

00:20:32.086 --> 00:20:33.004
What?

00:20:33.796 --> 00:20:35.631
What the heck was that dream?

00:20:35.715 --> 00:20:37.467
What was that about?

00:20:37.967 --> 00:20:38.926
That was so weird.

00:20:42.013 --> 00:20:43.806
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun, do you like me?

00:20:45.933 --> 00:20:48.311
I'll take good care of Ms. Wi.

00:20:48.394 --> 00:20:50.104
Are you worried a rumor might break out?

00:20:51.439 --> 00:20:52.982
If a rumor spreads, then be it.

00:20:53.066 --> 00:20:55.026
Can't I even date at my age?

00:20:55.109 --> 00:20:57.945
And they smell enchantingly sweet.

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:05.995
I'm late.

00:21:06.704 --> 00:21:09.499
Gosh, this is a pretty hearty lunch.

00:21:09.582 --> 00:21:11.793
There's chicken, rice, and salad.

00:21:11.876 --> 00:21:12.877
It's pretty well-rounded.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.003
This is good.

00:21:14.087 --> 00:21:17.048
Yes, I'll be a bit more careful.

00:21:17.131 --> 00:21:18.466
All right, goodbye.

00:21:21.344 --> 00:21:22.720
How much longer
do I have to put up with this?

00:21:22.804 --> 00:21:24.013
What is it?

00:21:24.097 --> 00:21:25.890
I wrote about the markup
on idol photo cards,

00:21:25.973 --> 00:21:27.683
and got told off
for ruining the idol singer's image.

00:21:27.767 --> 00:21:30.937
It's their gimmick
that ruined their public image, not me.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.563
At least the PR team says it nicely.

00:21:32.647 --> 00:21:34.649
I recently wrote an article about a drama

00:21:34.732 --> 00:21:36.776
and got tons of hateful messages
from the actors' fans,

00:21:36.859 --> 00:21:38.361
filled with nasty swear words.

00:21:38.444 --> 00:21:40.488
Getting cursed at is part of being
an entertainment reporter.

00:21:40.571 --> 00:21:42.281
Getting cursed at is one thing.

00:21:42.365 --> 00:21:45.159
But when I write about
a celebrity scandal or suicide,

00:21:45.743 --> 00:21:48.996
I'm shocked at how I write it up
like it's not a big deal.

00:21:49.872 --> 00:21:52.125
Well, if it's that difficult for you,

00:21:52.208 --> 00:21:54.335
you could move
to a different department or media outlet.

00:21:55.419 --> 00:21:56.671
Why stay here?

00:21:56.754 --> 00:21:59.590
I loved watching movies and dramas
since I was a kid.

00:21:59.674 --> 00:22:02.468
Enjoying good media content as a viewer

00:22:02.552 --> 00:22:06.430
isn't the same
as stepping into that world as a reporter.

00:22:06.514 --> 00:22:08.933
And it may seem like
we only write gossip pieces,

00:22:09.016 --> 00:22:10.935
but there are celebrities
who reach out to thank us.

00:22:11.686 --> 00:22:13.938
Gratitude like that
is what keeps us going.

00:22:14.522 --> 00:22:16.649
I could ask you the same question.

00:22:16.732 --> 00:22:18.317
I thought you'd leave at the first chance.

00:22:20.486 --> 00:22:21.320
Well, I…

00:22:25.783 --> 00:22:26.909
I'm not sure.

00:22:26.993 --> 00:22:28.244
What did you say?

00:22:28.327 --> 00:22:29.495
What I'm saying is,

00:22:30.163 --> 00:22:32.999
instead of sending Ms. Wi
to the Kang Pil-gu press conference,

00:22:33.082 --> 00:22:35.877
would you mind sending
a different reporter?

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.629
You called me all this way
just to ask me that?

00:22:39.839 --> 00:22:42.341
Circumstances came up, you see.

00:22:42.425 --> 00:22:43.676
When you ask a favor,

00:22:44.177 --> 00:22:46.512
you should explain
the circumstances first.

00:22:46.596 --> 00:22:48.389
Why are you so uptight?

00:22:48.472 --> 00:22:49.640
Consider how serious things must be

00:22:49.724 --> 00:22:52.476
for me, Lim Hyeon-jun,
to ask you this favor in person.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.270
There's no need to get emotional.

00:22:54.854 --> 00:22:55.938
Just explain it

00:22:56.564 --> 00:22:58.357
so that it makes sense to me.

00:23:04.363 --> 00:23:06.532
Well, something happened.

00:23:06.616 --> 00:23:08.492
It's too complicated…

00:23:09.535 --> 00:23:10.953
It's too complicated to explain.

00:23:12.872 --> 00:23:14.582
The truth is…

00:23:14.665 --> 00:23:16.417
This seems good enough to submit.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:17.877
Nice. Thank you.

00:23:22.924 --> 00:23:25.593
I hear you're doing an amazing job
here at the entertainment desk.

00:23:25.676 --> 00:23:26.802
Word has gotten around.

00:23:28.221 --> 00:23:30.973
I'm pretty exceptional, after all.

00:23:31.057 --> 00:23:33.851
So what brings you here all of a sudden?

00:23:33.935 --> 00:23:37.480
You're not here to ask me
to return to the political desk,

00:23:38.064 --> 00:23:39.065
are you?

00:23:39.148 --> 00:23:40.233
Actually, you're right.

00:23:40.942 --> 00:23:42.944
Really?
I'm returning to the political desk?

00:23:43.027 --> 00:23:44.111
Yes.

00:23:44.195 --> 00:23:45.029
But first,

00:23:45.988 --> 00:23:49.116
you need to destroy
all the videos you have,

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.159
as if they never existed.

00:23:51.244 --> 00:23:52.453
You did what?

00:23:52.536 --> 00:23:53.663
-Onion.
-Onion!

00:23:55.081 --> 00:23:56.165
-Onion.
-Onion!

00:23:57.333 --> 00:23:59.126
Oh, that Onion.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:00.044
Yes.

00:24:00.586 --> 00:24:03.881
So the secondhand selling app
you said you've used before…

00:24:03.965 --> 00:24:05.925
Yes, that's right.

00:24:06.008 --> 00:24:09.136
I sold a rice cooker to Ms. Wi.

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:12.932
Then the reason why Ms. Wi
looked strangely excited that day--

00:24:13.015 --> 00:24:15.309
Yes. She came out to meet me,

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:17.019
but I'm not the one she met.

00:24:17.103 --> 00:24:18.688
I had someone else go in my place.

00:24:27.947 --> 00:24:30.658
I can't believe you did that on Onion.

00:24:36.122 --> 00:24:36.956
Oh, gosh.

00:24:39.375 --> 00:24:40.376
Seriously?

00:24:48.175 --> 00:24:50.428
Mr. Lim, it's a shame
to hear about your predicament,

00:24:50.511 --> 00:24:51.554
but there's no way around it.

00:24:51.637 --> 00:24:54.598
Regardless of whether
Ms. Wi attends the press conference,

00:24:54.682 --> 00:24:56.267
she'll see the photos taken there.

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:57.935
Then what am I supposed to do?

00:24:58.019 --> 00:25:00.563
You and I agreed to team up,

00:25:00.646 --> 00:25:03.649
so you should suggest a solution
in a crisis like this.

00:25:03.733 --> 00:25:06.110
Imagine if Ms. Wi finds out I lied to her.

00:25:06.193 --> 00:25:08.279
Knowing her personality,
she won't stand for it.

00:25:08.362 --> 00:25:09.905
She'll swear never to see me again.

00:25:12.408 --> 00:25:15.161
If you get caught
trying to cover up this situation,

00:25:15.244 --> 00:25:16.370
it'll make things worse.

00:25:18.205 --> 00:25:19.415
Just tell her the truth.

00:25:21.208 --> 00:25:23.669
Why are you saying things
that don't help at all?

00:25:23.753 --> 00:25:25.046
That's not a solution!

00:25:28.424 --> 00:25:29.383
I want to

00:25:30.509 --> 00:25:32.261
stay at Sports Eunseong a bit longer.

00:25:32.845 --> 00:25:34.680
You're turning down
the investigative journalism team?

00:25:35.264 --> 00:25:36.682
But why?

00:25:37.183 --> 00:25:39.226
Don't tell me
you're still pursuing that case.

00:25:40.561 --> 00:25:42.104
No, it's not that.

00:25:43.773 --> 00:25:47.610
The entertainment desk has grown on me,
and it's been rewarding.

00:25:47.693 --> 00:25:49.236
Rewarding? Listen, you punk.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.031
They make you write up
30 to 40 articles a day here.

00:25:53.574 --> 00:25:55.743
Well, sometimes I get a dose of reality.

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:00.498
But even if it's an article
that'll be forgotten overnight,

00:26:02.083 --> 00:26:03.542
there are readers out there

00:26:04.919 --> 00:26:06.545
who still want it and enjoy it.

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:10.091
More than that, I feel more at peace
than I did at the political desk.

00:26:10.883 --> 00:26:12.134
So I'll stick around a little longer.

00:26:12.843 --> 00:26:14.303
I appreciate the offer you made.

00:26:15.221 --> 00:26:16.180
I'm sorry, Chief.

00:26:28.651 --> 00:26:30.903
-Yes?
-Hello, sir. It's me.

00:26:31.404 --> 00:26:34.073
I don't think we can get Ms. Wi to return.

00:26:34.156 --> 00:26:35.950
Why? Did she refuse the offer?

00:26:36.867 --> 00:26:37.785
Yes, sir.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:40.830
My apologies, sir.

00:26:40.913 --> 00:26:42.748
I trust you'll take care of that reporter.

00:26:42.832 --> 00:26:44.667
Stop her from causing more trouble.

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.627
Yes, sir. Goodbye.

00:26:49.797 --> 00:26:51.382
I'm going to lose my mind.

00:26:52.049 --> 00:26:54.260
What if I end up
taking the hit from all this?

00:26:54.343 --> 00:26:56.053
Wi Jeong-sin, that punk!

00:26:59.557 --> 00:27:02.184
These clothes aren't really my style.

00:27:03.936 --> 00:27:05.312
Let's check out that place.

00:27:05.396 --> 00:27:06.605
-That one?
-Yeah.

00:27:19.368 --> 00:27:20.369
PRICE: 1,860,000 WON

00:27:21.495 --> 00:27:22.329
One million eight hundred…

00:27:23.789 --> 00:27:25.875
Jeong-sin, it's way too expensive here.

00:27:25.958 --> 00:27:26.959
Let's go somewhere else.

00:27:27.042 --> 00:27:29.295
Hey, don't be a chicken
and just choose one.

00:27:29.962 --> 00:27:32.214
Look at the price of this
before telling me not to chicken out.

00:27:32.298 --> 00:27:35.509
Choose one while I'm offering.
This is a rare opportunity.

00:27:38.387 --> 00:27:39.388
Then can I get this?

00:27:40.514 --> 00:27:41.682
-This one?
-Yes.

00:27:42.725 --> 00:27:43.601
Let's take a look.

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:47.396
-It looks nice.
-And it's the perfect size.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.522
I knew you wanted it.

00:27:54.195 --> 00:27:55.613
Do you offer a 12-month payment plan?

00:27:55.696 --> 00:27:56.864
Yes.

00:27:58.741 --> 00:27:59.700
Thanks for this.

00:28:02.745 --> 00:28:04.788
You probably spent
about a month's paycheck.

00:28:04.872 --> 00:28:05.915
Are you sure this is okay?

00:28:05.998 --> 00:28:07.708
Of course. That's why I got it for you.

00:28:08.834 --> 00:28:11.378
You always nag me whenever I spend money.

00:28:11.462 --> 00:28:12.505
Why splurge today?

00:28:13.172 --> 00:28:15.883
It's not like I didn't want to get you

00:28:15.966 --> 00:28:18.135
nice clothes and shoes
at a place like this.

00:28:18.219 --> 00:28:21.180
We have no parents or relatives
who would give us money.

00:28:21.263 --> 00:28:23.265
I don't want to ask anyone for help,

00:28:24.141 --> 00:28:25.976
so I just have to cut back a bit.

00:28:27.478 --> 00:28:28.479
Be good to me, you brat!

00:28:29.563 --> 00:28:30.397
Yes, ma'am.

00:28:32.566 --> 00:28:33.484
Here, have a drink.

00:28:39.281 --> 00:28:40.366
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:28:45.621 --> 00:28:47.331
It seems like only yesterday
that you were a kid.

00:28:47.873 --> 00:28:50.626
Now look at us, drinking together.
How touching.

00:28:50.709 --> 00:28:52.670
Jeez, stop being so dramatic.

00:28:53.212 --> 00:28:56.549
Hey, do you remember
how I was a high school senior

00:28:56.632 --> 00:28:58.133
when you started elementary school?

00:28:58.217 --> 00:28:59.802
You'll never imagine
how hectic it was for me.

00:28:59.885 --> 00:29:04.390
Yet I still got into Hankuk University.
Aren't you proud of your big sister?

00:29:04.473 --> 00:29:06.976
Wow, you never fail
to turn things into a brag about yourself.

00:29:08.143 --> 00:29:09.103
Oh, right.

00:29:09.186 --> 00:29:10.938
-The press conference is tomorrow, right?
-Yeah.

00:29:11.814 --> 00:29:12.982
Are you attending?

00:29:13.065 --> 00:29:14.358
No, I'm not part of that.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.820
I wonder when I'll get to attend.

00:29:17.903 --> 00:29:19.989
Learn from me and work hard.

00:29:20.072 --> 00:29:21.407
Your day will come then.

00:29:21.907 --> 00:29:22.741
Sure.

00:29:23.325 --> 00:29:26.579
By the way, is it over with that guy
you were flirting with?

00:29:27.204 --> 00:29:28.163
What are you talking about?

00:29:28.247 --> 00:29:32.376
Remember the bro at work
who handed you the gimbap?

00:29:32.876 --> 00:29:34.086
Why do you call every guy "bro"?

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:37.047
He's the president of our company!

00:29:37.131 --> 00:29:38.132
The president?

00:29:38.966 --> 00:29:40.968
That young, handsome guy is the president?

00:29:41.051 --> 00:29:42.052
Holy cow.

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:45.389
You must be lucky with guys.

00:29:45.472 --> 00:29:47.891
Jeong-sin, make things work this time.

00:29:47.975 --> 00:29:49.393
That bro is definitely into you.

00:29:49.476 --> 00:29:50.477
I'm positive.

00:29:51.478 --> 00:29:53.439
It's not like that. Just eat!

00:29:55.649 --> 00:29:57.234
Why do you always hit me?

00:29:59.695 --> 00:30:01.947
Doesn't that mean I have a chance?

00:30:02.031 --> 00:30:05.701
Forget about that guy already
and come to me.

00:30:06.452 --> 00:30:08.203
I'm right here in front of you.

00:30:08.287 --> 00:30:09.538
I've always been here for you.

00:30:11.457 --> 00:30:13.167
And I'm still waiting for you.

00:30:43.781 --> 00:30:45.532
Seeing that you asked me out for tea,

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:48.202
I'm getting a bad feeling.

00:30:52.122 --> 00:30:54.291
I wanted to return
the umbrella you lent me.

00:31:05.844 --> 00:31:07.346
I used this as an excuse to see you,

00:31:08.138 --> 00:31:09.848
but I actually need to tell you something.

00:31:12.601 --> 00:31:14.561
Mr. Lee, I can't return your feelings.

00:31:23.195 --> 00:31:25.823
I expected as much on my way here.

00:31:27.658 --> 00:31:28.492
I'm sorry.

00:31:31.245 --> 00:31:33.747
I think you should take a moment…

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.084
to think about how you really feel.

00:31:39.169 --> 00:31:41.213
Was it really me you liked?

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.257
Or was it someone

00:31:44.675 --> 00:31:46.051
I reminded you of?

00:32:14.747 --> 00:32:18.667
I think you should take a moment
to think about how you really feel.

00:32:19.251 --> 00:32:21.086
Was it really me you liked?

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:23.088
Or was it someone

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:25.966
I reminded you of?

00:32:27.968 --> 00:32:29.344
I always felt like

00:32:29.428 --> 00:32:32.556
you were looking for someone else in me.

00:32:34.767 --> 00:32:36.894
At the end of your gaze,

00:32:37.811 --> 00:32:40.022
it was always the chief.

00:32:41.273 --> 00:32:42.107
As if…

00:32:44.234 --> 00:32:45.068
she were a child

00:32:46.737 --> 00:32:48.030
you left behind and couldn't forget.

00:33:20.187 --> 00:33:22.773
Mr. Lim, it's a shame
to hear about your predicament,

00:33:22.856 --> 00:33:23.941
but there's no way around it.

00:33:24.024 --> 00:33:26.735
Regardless of whether
Ms. Wi attends the press conference,

00:33:26.819 --> 00:33:28.737
she'll see the photos taken there.

00:33:35.035 --> 00:33:35.067
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 5

00:33:35.067 --> 00:33:36.703
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 5

00:33:37.371 --> 00:33:38.622
PRODUCTION PRESS CONFERENCE

00:33:38.705 --> 00:33:44.044
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 5

00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:51.635
FACING THE ABYSS AT JUSTICE'S EDGE…
WILL IT BE CORRUPTION OR COVER-UP?

00:34:04.773 --> 00:34:07.234
WE WILL FOREVER SUPPORT
ACTOR LIM HYEON-JUN

00:34:34.595 --> 00:34:36.346
Bro!

00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:38.640
She's here. Ms. Wi is here!

00:34:38.724 --> 00:34:40.767
We're in so much trouble!

00:34:40.851 --> 00:34:43.896
I told her so many times
not to send Ms. Wi!

00:34:43.979 --> 00:34:45.939
Now isn't the time for this.
You can't give up.

00:34:46.982 --> 00:34:48.400
Bro, you can't have another panic attack.

00:34:48.483 --> 00:34:50.068
Seriously, why isn't
another panic attack coming?

00:34:50.152 --> 00:34:51.486
That came out wrong.

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:53.947
Seriously, why isn't Byeong-gi coming?

00:34:54.031 --> 00:34:55.324
What are we going to do?

00:34:55.407 --> 00:34:56.700
Hello.

00:34:56.783 --> 00:34:58.785
-Hey, Director Bak!
-Byeong-gi!

00:34:58.869 --> 00:35:00.621
Ms. Wi is here!

00:35:00.704 --> 00:35:01.788
What should we do?

00:35:01.872 --> 00:35:04.791
I'm dressed totally differently
from when I met Ms. Wi that day.

00:35:04.875 --> 00:35:05.918
Will that be enough?

00:35:06.001 --> 00:35:06.835
Yes!

00:35:06.919 --> 00:35:08.462
She didn't suspect anything
when I met her,

00:35:08.545 --> 00:35:09.838
which means she's not observant.

00:35:10.714 --> 00:35:12.799
-But…
-As if she'll fall for this.

00:35:12.883 --> 00:35:14.468
Director Bak, what's wrong?

00:35:14.551 --> 00:35:15.636
I'm okay.

00:35:16.178 --> 00:35:17.930
Mr. Lim, we have to get going now.

00:35:18.013 --> 00:35:19.598
I'm about to lose it.

00:35:19.681 --> 00:35:20.891
What are we going to do?

00:35:20.974 --> 00:35:23.060
What else can we do? Let's go.

00:35:23.143 --> 00:35:25.854
-Seriously, I can't deal with this!
-Oh, man.

00:35:31.735 --> 00:35:33.111
Hey, this is a great idea!

00:35:33.195 --> 00:35:34.029
Gosh.

00:35:35.447 --> 00:35:37.240
-Byeong-gi?
-Director Bak!

00:35:37.824 --> 00:35:38.909
He's breaking out in a cold sweat.

00:35:38.992 --> 00:35:41.286
Hey, what's wrong?

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:42.663
-Where does it hurt?
-I can't…

00:35:42.746 --> 00:35:44.581
All right, it's time for the photocall.

00:35:44.665 --> 00:35:46.541
"They say you can't fix people."

00:35:46.625 --> 00:35:48.168
"But I do."

00:35:48.251 --> 00:35:51.588
No one delivers this line
better than the actor himself.

00:35:51.672 --> 00:35:54.466
First up is the star
of Good Detective Kang Pil-gu,

00:35:54.549 --> 00:35:56.259
actor Lim Hyeon-jun!

00:35:56.343 --> 00:35:57.469
Please come to the stage.

00:36:00.222 --> 00:36:01.056
Hello.

00:36:02.265 --> 00:36:04.893
-Please look over here!
-Over here!

00:36:04.977 --> 00:36:06.770
Thank you for coming.

00:36:07.688 --> 00:36:09.481
Wow, cameras are flashing everywhere.

00:36:09.564 --> 00:36:11.483
Mr. Lim, you look amazing today.

00:36:11.566 --> 00:36:13.819
Keep looking amazing,
and please look straight ahead.

00:36:16.196 --> 00:36:17.572
Now look to the left and right.

00:36:17.656 --> 00:36:21.034
Mr. Lim, can you lift up your hand more
and make a heart for us?

00:36:21.702 --> 00:36:22.536
Sure.

00:36:22.619 --> 00:36:23.620
Very nice.

00:36:23.704 --> 00:36:26.498
-Great!
-Look here, please!

00:36:26.581 --> 00:36:28.125
We'll see lots of great shots from today.

00:36:28.208 --> 00:36:30.502
-Over here, please!
-Please look over here!

00:36:30.585 --> 00:36:32.629
-Look this way!
-Now a heart with your right hand, please.

00:36:33.255 --> 00:36:35.215
-Please look here!
-Over here too!

00:36:35.298 --> 00:36:36.216
Very nice!

00:36:37.342 --> 00:36:40.262
Wow, he's the best at fan service.

00:36:40.345 --> 00:36:41.805
That was great. Thank you.

00:36:41.888 --> 00:36:43.974
Now, could you wait to the side
for a moment?

00:36:44.057 --> 00:36:46.476
We'll continue the photocall
with the beautiful Ms. Gwon Se-na,

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.645
who has joined the cast for season five.

00:36:48.729 --> 00:36:50.230
Ms. Gwon Se-na, please come out.

00:36:53.775 --> 00:36:55.027
Please look over here!

00:36:55.986 --> 00:36:57.362
You look beautiful!

00:36:59.031 --> 00:37:01.658
Look at all these camera flashes!

00:37:02.242 --> 00:37:03.410
Please make a heart with your hands!

00:37:03.493 --> 00:37:05.871
-Make a heart, please!
-Look over here!

00:37:06.455 --> 00:37:07.789
Let's try some different poses, please.

00:37:07.873 --> 00:37:09.291
She has the most charming smile.

00:37:09.875 --> 00:37:11.585
Please direct your gaze at the cameras.

00:37:12.335 --> 00:37:14.796
She's making all sorts of hearts for us.

00:37:15.422 --> 00:37:16.840
This is it for individual photos.

00:37:16.923 --> 00:37:19.843
Next, we'll move on
to the joint photocall.

00:37:19.926 --> 00:37:20.927
Okay.

00:37:21.928 --> 00:37:24.681
Make sure you get a good shot. Zoom in.

00:37:24.765 --> 00:37:27.059
-Stand closer together, please!
-Closer together!

00:37:28.101 --> 00:37:31.104
You're standing a little too far apart.
Please move closer together.

00:37:31.188 --> 00:37:32.689
-Shall we?
-Yes, please.

00:37:35.901 --> 00:37:36.777
Look here, please!

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:42.032
How about making a heart with your hands?

00:37:43.658 --> 00:37:45.660
Here's a heart.

00:37:45.744 --> 00:37:47.412
A heart!

00:37:48.163 --> 00:37:49.539
A heart.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.418
I think we'd like to see more fun hearts.

00:37:53.502 --> 00:37:55.045
It's a heart!

00:37:55.629 --> 00:37:57.130
A heart!

00:37:57.964 --> 00:37:59.007
-A heart!
-A heart.

00:38:00.217 --> 00:38:01.426
Here's a heart.

00:38:04.554 --> 00:38:06.515
"LIM HYEON-JUN,
A WARM SMILE BEHIND THE COLD EYES"

00:38:06.598 --> 00:38:07.933
I've never seen a heart like that.

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.435
-Over here, please!
-To the right!

00:38:10.519 --> 00:38:12.771
"LIM HYEON-JUN REJECTS GWON SE-NA'S HEART
HEARTS ARE DIY"

00:38:12.854 --> 00:38:14.773
Thank you so much!

00:38:15.607 --> 00:38:18.401
Let me begin by asking the reporters
for their understanding.

00:38:18.485 --> 00:38:21.113
Director Bak Byeong-gi,
who was scheduled to attend today,

00:38:21.196 --> 00:38:24.282
was unfortunately unable to join us
due to health reasons.

00:38:24.366 --> 00:38:25.867
We appreciate your understanding.

00:38:26.409 --> 00:38:29.121
-He got severe indigestion.
-I see.

00:38:29.204 --> 00:38:30.997
Let's change the subject

00:38:31.081 --> 00:38:33.333
-and continue by interviewing the actors.
-Yes.

00:38:34.167 --> 00:38:35.627
I see a lot of reporters are here today.

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:38.046
Please raise your hand
if you have a question,

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:40.173
and the actors will answer it.

00:38:41.508 --> 00:38:43.301
Please pass the mic
to the one in the sky blue shirt.

00:38:44.052 --> 00:38:47.514
Ms. Gwon Se-na,
what can we look forward to

00:38:47.597 --> 00:38:49.766
in season five
of Good Detective Kang Pil-gu?

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:51.893
Well, unlike Pil-gu,

00:38:51.977 --> 00:38:55.147
I-su relies on solid evidence
when conducting investigations,

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:56.773
so they're always at odds.

00:38:57.357 --> 00:39:00.652
I think their teamwork and chemistry
when solving cases together

00:39:00.735 --> 00:39:02.070
is something to look forward to.

00:39:02.154 --> 00:39:04.489
We look forward to seeing that chemistry.

00:39:04.573 --> 00:39:06.199
What sets season five apart

00:39:06.283 --> 00:39:08.994
from the previous seasons of Kang Pil-gu?

00:39:10.954 --> 00:39:11.913
In this season,

00:39:11.997 --> 00:39:15.083
you'll witness Pil-gu's downfall
as a corrupt detective

00:39:15.167 --> 00:39:18.295
and the tormented human side
of Kang Pil-gu.

00:39:18.378 --> 00:39:22.048
Make sure to tune into the drama
to check out these parts.

00:39:22.132 --> 00:39:23.925
I have a question for Mr. Lim.

00:39:24.009 --> 00:39:25.510
I heard you opened

00:39:25.594 --> 00:39:29.014
the Kang Pil-gu 5 set
exclusively for Sports Eunseong.

00:39:29.598 --> 00:39:31.683
-Is this true?
-Is that true?

00:39:31.766 --> 00:39:34.311
Seriously? Why only Sports Eunseong?

00:39:34.394 --> 00:39:35.228
That's so unfair.

00:39:35.312 --> 00:39:36.354
We're reporters too.

00:39:37.689 --> 00:39:39.191
No, of course not.

00:39:39.983 --> 00:39:42.485
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

00:39:42.569 --> 00:39:46.740
What happened was
that we had planned to give

00:39:47.324 --> 00:39:52.787
each media outlet
individual access to our set.

00:39:52.871 --> 00:39:54.372
Right.

00:39:54.456 --> 00:39:57.542
-That's right.
-So we decided to draw straws.

00:39:58.877 --> 00:40:02.547
And Sports Eunseong
happened to be picked first.

00:40:02.631 --> 00:40:04.507
Man, Sports Eunseong is so lucky.

00:40:04.591 --> 00:40:07.177
We plan to invite every reporter on set

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:09.596
before we finish shooting the drama,

00:40:09.679 --> 00:40:12.265
so we'd appreciate it
if you could wait a bit longer.

00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:14.434
So they were going to invite everyone.

00:40:14.893 --> 00:40:15.936
Yes.

00:40:16.019 --> 00:40:18.939
Yes, please be patient.
Meanwhile, we'll take more questions.

00:40:19.606 --> 00:40:20.607
The reporter in the back?

00:40:21.191 --> 00:40:23.818
I have a question
for both Mr. Lim and Ms. Gwon.

00:40:23.902 --> 00:40:27.322
Is there a romantic storyline
between you two in season five?

00:40:27.405 --> 00:40:28.740
-No, there isn't--
-Keep an eye out for it!

00:40:33.078 --> 00:40:35.288
I'm assuming
there's nothing in the beginning,

00:40:35.372 --> 00:40:36.790
but it develops later on?

00:40:38.041 --> 00:40:39.459
-No--
-Many viewers

00:40:39.542 --> 00:40:42.212
have been curious
about Kang Pil-gu's romantic side.

00:40:42.295 --> 00:40:46.967
The writer is working on a script
that will meet everyone's expectations,

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:48.385
so you can look forward to it.

00:40:50.011 --> 00:40:53.765
Do we finally get to see Kang Pil-gu
in a relationship, then?

00:40:55.267 --> 00:40:56.518
Well…

00:40:58.395 --> 00:41:02.065
Yes, Reporter Wi Jeong-sin
from Sports Eunseong!

00:41:02.983 --> 00:41:04.067
-Me?
-Yes.

00:41:04.567 --> 00:41:07.112
You held your hand up like this.

00:41:09.114 --> 00:41:10.156
What's your question?

00:41:15.495 --> 00:41:16.454
Well,

00:41:17.205 --> 00:41:19.249
I'm less interested in
Kang Pil-gu's romantic storyline.

00:41:19.332 --> 00:41:22.877
Rather, I'd like to hear how you portrayed
both the righteous Kang Pil-gu

00:41:22.961 --> 00:41:26.131
and the corrupt detective Kang Pil-gu,
a character who is both good and evil.

00:41:26.214 --> 00:41:28.675
I would like to ask about
the effort it took to play that duality.

00:41:29.384 --> 00:41:30.218
Thank you.

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.013
As I said before,

00:41:34.681 --> 00:41:37.225
you'll be able to witness

00:41:37.309 --> 00:41:39.561
the tormented human side of Kang Pil-gu.

00:41:58.038 --> 00:41:59.080
Hello?

00:41:59.164 --> 00:42:00.623
Hello, Ms. Wi Jeong-sin.

00:42:03.418 --> 00:42:04.753
Hello, Mr. Kim Dong-jun.

00:42:04.836 --> 00:42:06.379
How are you doing?

00:42:06.463 --> 00:42:07.839
I'm calling to give you an exclusive.

00:42:08.715 --> 00:42:09.758
An exclusive?

00:42:09.841 --> 00:42:11.718
I'm working on a new project.

00:42:11.801 --> 00:42:15.180
I said you'd be the first person
I'd contact, remember?

00:42:16.931 --> 00:42:19.309
So, this is you keeping your promise?

00:42:19.392 --> 00:42:20.518
Thank you so much.

00:42:20.602 --> 00:42:22.103
I look forward to the exclusive interview.

00:42:22.187 --> 00:42:24.773
Of course. I'm an expert at interviewing.

00:42:26.941 --> 00:42:28.193
Right.

00:42:28.276 --> 00:42:31.654
My manager will get in touch with you
about the time and location.

00:42:31.738 --> 00:42:33.907
Thank you. I'll be waiting, then.

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.824
Goodbye.

00:42:42.415 --> 00:42:44.709
So we can't avoid the surge
in production costs,

00:42:44.793 --> 00:42:47.545
but a transparent revenue structure
could resolve this.

00:42:48.505 --> 00:42:49.506
Sounds good.

00:42:51.216 --> 00:42:52.967
Chief, the next agenda is…

00:42:53.051 --> 00:42:54.052
Just a moment.

00:42:57.889 --> 00:42:58.807
Yes, hello.

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:03.061
Excuse me?

00:43:05.146 --> 00:43:06.481
How badly is he hurt?

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.734
Which hospital?

00:43:10.485 --> 00:43:11.611
Yes.

00:43:41.015 --> 00:43:42.350
Damn it.

00:43:45.145 --> 00:43:46.438
Let's take my car.

00:43:48.022 --> 00:43:49.399
You can't drive in this state.

00:44:06.124 --> 00:44:07.041
What's your kid's name?

00:44:07.792 --> 00:44:08.668
Jae-ha.

00:44:10.378 --> 00:44:11.379
Yun Jae-ha.

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:17.594
I think you should take a moment
to think about how you really feel.

00:44:18.136 --> 00:44:20.054
At the end of your gaze,

00:44:21.055 --> 00:44:23.391
it was always the chief.

00:44:41.034 --> 00:44:41.868
Yes?

00:44:43.453 --> 00:44:46.247
Goodness, Director Bak.

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:50.335
You must've been under a lot of stress.

00:44:50.835 --> 00:44:53.379
What did the doctor say?

00:44:55.006 --> 00:44:56.966
It's just stomach cramps and exhaustion.

00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:59.010
I'm getting IV fluids
and taking the day off.

00:44:59.093 --> 00:45:02.180
-Oh, man.
-How'd the production press conference go?

00:45:02.263 --> 00:45:04.682
Yes, thanks to you…
No, that's not what I mean.

00:45:05.517 --> 00:45:07.143
It went well enough.

00:45:07.227 --> 00:45:09.729
-I guess it was thanks to me.
-Come on.

00:45:09.812 --> 00:45:12.148
Thanks to my timely collapse,

00:45:12.232 --> 00:45:13.942
you escaped a crisis.

00:45:14.025 --> 00:45:17.862
Come on, don't say that.
You're making me feel bad.

00:45:19.072 --> 00:45:19.906
Mr. Lim.

00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:22.200
Yes? What is it?

00:45:22.283 --> 00:45:24.369
I can't keep hiding like this.

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:30.875
Yeah, I know.

00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:34.379
Today, we got lucky…

00:45:36.172 --> 00:45:38.424
I don't know
if "lucky" is even the right word.

00:45:38.508 --> 00:45:41.427
In any case,
we got through today because I collapsed.

00:45:41.511 --> 00:45:43.930
But there's no guarantee
we won't get caught later.

00:45:44.013 --> 00:45:45.848
My face could get on
the behind-the-scenes footage.

00:45:45.932 --> 00:45:47.517
I agree with you.

00:45:49.435 --> 00:45:52.063
I wasn't sure if I should tell you this,

00:45:52.146 --> 00:45:54.357
but I think it's best that you know.

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:55.817
What is it?

00:45:57.735 --> 00:45:58.945
The truth is, Ms. Wi…

00:46:00.738 --> 00:46:01.739
Yes?

00:46:01.823 --> 00:46:04.200
I don't think she likes the real you.

00:46:04.284 --> 00:46:05.118
What?

00:46:06.786 --> 00:46:10.206
To tell you the truth,
she told me something the night I met her.

00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:11.958
The one I fell for

00:46:12.041 --> 00:46:14.294
was Detective Kang Pil-gu,
driven by justice,

00:46:15.003 --> 00:46:16.921
not the actor Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:46:22.135 --> 00:46:24.721
Not Lim Hyeon-jun, but Kang Pil-gu.

00:46:24.804 --> 00:46:27.849
She said she only likes Kang Pil-gu,

00:46:28.558 --> 00:46:29.976
the character I created.

00:46:31.394 --> 00:46:32.395
No…

00:46:34.731 --> 00:46:36.399
No, that's not possible.

00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:42.322
You've been under a lot of stress
because people see you and Kang Pil-gu

00:46:42.405 --> 00:46:44.073
as the same person.

00:46:44.824 --> 00:46:47.702
I think Ms. Wi was confused
for a moment too.

00:46:47.785 --> 00:46:49.954
She liked Kang Pil-gu as a fan,

00:46:50.038 --> 00:46:53.124
but she liked Melomaster
in a romantic way.

00:46:54.042 --> 00:46:55.752
That's what I think.

00:47:03.259 --> 00:47:04.093
Then what about me?

00:47:07.347 --> 00:47:08.681
She only liked Kang Pil-gu…

00:47:10.892 --> 00:47:12.852
and Melomaster from Onion?

00:47:14.604 --> 00:47:16.689
She never had feelings for Lim Hyeon-jun?

00:47:17.273 --> 00:47:19.692
It may be hard to accept,

00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:22.236
but that's how it seems.

00:48:06.572 --> 00:48:08.908
Do you like Lim Hyeon-jun?

00:48:08.991 --> 00:48:10.118
Yes, I do.

00:48:10.993 --> 00:48:12.412
It's the first time in my life.

00:48:12.495 --> 00:48:13.746
I've never liked someone…

00:48:15.581 --> 00:48:17.375
so unconditionally.

00:48:17.959 --> 00:48:19.585
He was really cool, of course.

00:48:20.169 --> 00:48:21.379
He's manly,

00:48:21.879 --> 00:48:23.381
yet still has that boyish charm.

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:26.676
You can be old and still be cool.

00:48:27.218 --> 00:48:29.929
Everyone has their own kind of charm
that suits their age.

00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:33.182
I think Ms. Wi was confused
for a moment too.

00:48:33.683 --> 00:48:36.060
She liked Kang Pil-gu as a fan,

00:48:36.144 --> 00:48:40.148
but she liked Melomaster
in a romantic way.

00:48:40.648 --> 00:48:42.400
That's what I think.

00:48:46.112 --> 00:48:47.280
That's not true!

00:48:47.363 --> 00:48:49.240
Wi Jeong-sin definitely liked the real me!

00:48:49.323 --> 00:48:50.491
Without a doubt.

00:48:50.575 --> 00:48:52.910
It's ridiculous to cater to every tantrum

00:48:52.994 --> 00:48:54.454
of a middle-aged man acting like a diva!

00:48:54.537 --> 00:48:57.415
The second you think you're special,
that's when trouble starts.

00:48:57.498 --> 00:49:01.586
I can destroy you
with nothing more than my writing.

00:49:01.669 --> 00:49:02.837
I don't want…

00:49:03.921 --> 00:49:04.881
your apology.

00:49:05.715 --> 00:49:07.175
Was I wrong?

00:49:13.347 --> 00:49:14.807
I like someone else.

00:49:15.808 --> 00:49:17.477
And I'm still not over him.

00:49:21.272 --> 00:49:22.273
I don't know.

00:49:22.356 --> 00:49:23.691
-Hey, Su-ji.
-Yes?

00:49:23.775 --> 00:49:25.777
What is it that women want?

00:49:28.946 --> 00:49:30.239
It's so complicated.

00:49:30.323 --> 00:49:32.658
Sure. I'll play the song you requested.

00:49:32.742 --> 00:49:34.076
What are you saying?

00:49:40.249 --> 00:49:41.793
"NASTY MAN"

00:49:57.475 --> 00:50:00.102
YOU MADE ME CRY LIKE SAD MUSIC
AND LEFT ME FOR A FARAWAY PLACE

00:50:05.358 --> 00:50:07.401
The lyrics are just spot on.

00:50:08.986 --> 00:50:12.448
IS IT REGRET
THAT LEFT BRUISES ON MY HEART?

00:50:12.532 --> 00:50:15.868
YOU ONLY GAVE ME PAIN AND LEFT ME

00:50:15.952 --> 00:50:20.373
I GAVE YOU MY HEART, MY LOVE, MY ALL

00:50:20.456 --> 00:50:23.668
BUT NOW YOU'RE LEAVING, LIKE A STRANGER

00:50:24.335 --> 00:50:27.588
Take the pain of goodbye with you

00:50:27.672 --> 00:50:30.550
Oh

00:50:30.633 --> 00:50:33.219

Right, the fire extinguisher.

Yes, the fire extinguisher.

00:51:45.207 --> 00:51:47.293

This looks good.

Is the rice cooker still available?

00:53:09.959 --> 00:53:10.918
Onion!

00:53:14.547 --> 00:53:15.840
Yes, it is.

00:53:18.259 --> 00:53:19.802
Does the rice cooker…

00:53:19.885 --> 00:53:22.346
Does the rice cooker work well?

00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:24.265
Yes, it works fine.

00:53:24.348 --> 00:53:25.474
If you don't mind me asking,

00:53:26.726 --> 00:53:28.728
if it works fine,

00:53:28.811 --> 00:53:30.563
why are you selling it?

00:53:30.646 --> 00:53:31.647
Why does it matter?

00:53:32.773 --> 00:53:34.900
What kind of question is that?

00:53:39.363 --> 00:53:42.366
We're a family of two,
so the rice cooker is too big for us.

00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:43.826
It's not a good fit for our home.

00:53:45.745 --> 00:53:46.787
"It's not a good fit"?

00:53:47.413 --> 00:53:49.248
It's not a good fit for your home?

00:53:50.666 --> 00:53:53.919
Still, isn't it better to have

00:53:54.003 --> 00:53:55.671
a nice, big one?

00:53:57.048 --> 00:53:59.759
Seriously? Then why don't you buy it?

00:54:09.602 --> 00:54:10.686
Okay.

00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:13.064
For a quick and easy deal,
I'll give you a 10,000 won discount.

00:54:13.147 --> 00:54:14.231
Thank you.

00:54:15.816 --> 00:54:18.486
Could I pick it up tomorrow evening?

00:54:18.569 --> 00:54:20.279
Yes, that's fine.

00:54:20.362 --> 00:54:21.781
Are you okay with a doorstep pickup?

00:54:21.864 --> 00:54:23.741
No, I'm not.

00:54:24.909 --> 00:54:26.786
I want to buy it in person.

00:54:28.746 --> 00:54:30.122
Man, what a hassle.

00:54:34.543 --> 00:54:36.962
Could you let me know
a time and place that works for you?

00:54:45.387 --> 00:54:48.307
I think Ms. Wi was confused
for a moment too.

00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:50.726
She liked Kang Pil-gu as a fan,

00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:54.647
but she liked Melomaster
in a romantic way.

00:54:54.730 --> 00:54:56.398
-That's what I think.
-Mr. Lim.

00:54:57.066 --> 00:54:58.567
-Yeah?
-We need to get ready.

00:54:58.651 --> 00:54:59.610
Right.

00:55:14.917 --> 00:55:15.751
Okay.

00:55:17.253 --> 00:55:18.337
-Hey, Su-ji.
-Yes?

00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:19.380
I'm heading out.

00:55:19.463 --> 00:55:20.798
Be safe.

00:55:21.924 --> 00:55:23.759
What's my horoscope for today?

00:55:23.843 --> 00:55:27.179
Your horoscope says
you should have a smooth day overall.

00:55:27.263 --> 00:55:30.099
However, unexpected events may arise,

00:55:30.182 --> 00:55:32.560
so it would be best to handle them calmly.

00:55:32.643 --> 00:55:35.187
Right, calmly.

00:55:37.523 --> 00:55:39.608
I can't keep hiding like this.

00:55:39.692 --> 00:55:41.277
Just tell her the truth.

00:55:41.902 --> 00:55:43.154
-Hey, Su-ji.
-Yes?

00:55:44.196 --> 00:55:46.657
Can you give me
some words of encouragement?

00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:48.242
No one can predict the outcome,

00:55:48.325 --> 00:55:51.537
but you won't leave any regrets
as long as you try your best.

00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:54.123
Jeez, more pointless remarks.

00:55:55.624 --> 00:55:57.042
Still, I feel encouraged.

00:55:57.126 --> 00:55:58.335
Thank you for the compliment.

00:55:59.503 --> 00:56:01.463
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun, do you like me?

00:56:07.636 --> 00:56:08.971
Goodbye, bro.

00:56:12.391 --> 00:56:15.060
We didn't even use it much,
so why are you selling it?

00:56:15.144 --> 00:56:16.270
It's too big.

00:56:16.353 --> 00:56:18.522
We don't need such a big rice cooker.

00:56:18.606 --> 00:56:20.357
It's not like we cook at home a lot.

00:56:20.441 --> 00:56:22.234
Then why'd you even buy it?

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:25.154
Well, I guess I wasn't thinking straight!

00:56:27.907 --> 00:56:28.908
Hey.

00:56:28.991 --> 00:56:31.243
Can you wear the sneakers
your ex-girlfriend bought for you?

00:56:31.327 --> 00:56:33.704
Yeah, of course.
The sneakers aren't to blame.

00:56:33.787 --> 00:56:34.622
But how?

00:56:34.705 --> 00:56:37.333
You'd be reminded of her
every time you wear them.

00:56:37.416 --> 00:56:38.417
It's human nature to forget.

00:56:39.001 --> 00:56:41.420
It's hard at first,
but it fades away after a while.

00:56:41.503 --> 00:56:43.255
Bad feelings are temporary,

00:56:43.339 --> 00:56:44.840
but objects last forever.

00:56:47.551 --> 00:56:49.637
You're only smart in situations like this.

00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:51.305
-Out of my way!
-Sure.

00:56:52.765 --> 00:56:54.683
It's raining. Want me to go instead?

00:56:54.767 --> 00:56:55.684
Forget it.

00:57:00.481 --> 00:57:02.566
What's taking them so long?
It's still raining.

00:57:03.943 --> 00:57:07.321
SEONGIL STATION

00:57:16.622 --> 00:57:19.250
I'm here. Are you running late?

00:57:22.544 --> 00:57:23.796
-Soulishere?
-What?

00:57:44.608 --> 00:57:45.651
What's happening?

00:57:45.734 --> 00:57:47.194
-For Onion, right?
-What?

00:57:47.778 --> 00:57:49.196
You came to sell the rice cooker.

00:57:52.032 --> 00:57:53.909
Wait, how did you know?

00:57:53.993 --> 00:57:56.578
-Why are you selling it anyway?
-What?

00:57:56.662 --> 00:57:57.621
Are you getting rid of it

00:57:57.705 --> 00:57:59.999
because things didn't work out
with Melomaster?

00:58:05.671 --> 00:58:07.798
You have no idea what's going on, do you?

00:58:08.674 --> 00:58:09.842
It was me,

00:58:10.676 --> 00:58:11.719
Melomaster.

00:58:13.554 --> 00:58:15.556
I was Melomaster,

00:58:15.639 --> 00:58:16.724
and Melomaster

00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:18.976
was me.

00:58:23.188 --> 00:58:24.606
You asked me if I liked you.

00:58:28.444 --> 00:58:29.278
Yes.

00:58:31.989 --> 00:58:33.449
I like you.

00:59:19.536 --> 00:59:21.663
SPECIAL THANKS TO OH YEON-SEO
FOR HER APPEARANCE

00:59:24.166 --> 00:59:26.001
How could something like this happen?

00:59:26.085 --> 00:59:27.753
How can this all be a coincidence?

00:59:27.836 --> 00:59:29.380
Take your time to think about it.

00:59:29.463 --> 00:59:31.465
I can wait as long as you need.

00:59:31.548 --> 00:59:34.927
I've never felt like
such an idiot in my life.

00:59:35.010 --> 00:59:38.097
From now on, I'll message you
instead of using the Onion app.

00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:39.014
Sweet dreams.

00:59:40.057 --> 00:59:41.183
I like you.

00:59:41.266 --> 00:59:43.060
I'm so pissed that I got fooled,

00:59:43.143 --> 00:59:44.395
but I can't stop thinking about him!

00:59:44.478 --> 00:59:45.312
REPORTER WI JEONG-SIN

00:59:47.356 --> 00:59:48.440
Hello?

00:59:48.524 --> 00:59:49.441
I want to see you.

00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.984
What?

00:59:55.864 --> 00:59:57.866
