00:00:13.242 --> 00:00:18.200
Ever since my parents passed, you’re the
only one who’s cared about me this much.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.248
Would you be my boyfriend?

00:00:24.552 --> 00:00:25.844
It was an accident.

00:00:25.844 --> 00:00:27.468
But I was able to help you last time.

00:00:27.773 --> 00:00:29.564
I hate that you’re blaming yourself.

00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:31.404
Make me a promise.

00:00:31.404 --> 00:00:34.427
From here on out, we live a normal life.

00:00:35.843 --> 00:00:39.529
If something happens to me one day,
I’ll believe you did your best.

00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:41.462
So you’re telling me
you can change the future?

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:43.128
I’m not changing anything.

00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:44.081
I…

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:45.342
I just helped him.

00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:46.743
About Uncle Jet…

00:00:48.442 --> 00:00:50.110
When are you planning to tell Jinn?

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:55.314
I’ll find a time to
talk to Jinn as soon as possible.

00:00:55.314 --> 00:00:57.536
From what I’ve seen in the movies…

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.848
when you decide to change something,

00:01:01.632 --> 00:01:06.058
it affects the future. Right?

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.601
Mom always told me not to drive too fast.

00:01:19.886 --> 00:01:21.237
But I never listened.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.499
I killed her.

00:01:24.457 --> 00:01:26.321
It should’ve been me who died.

00:01:27.084 --> 00:01:30.952
Jinn, no one wanted this to happen.

00:01:30.952 --> 00:01:32.131
It was an accident.

00:01:32.784 --> 00:01:35.271
It isn’t anyone’s fault, sweetheart.

00:01:36.208 --> 00:01:37.466
I feel bad for him.

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.756
Graduation is just a few days away.

00:01:41.736 --> 00:01:43.426
Auntie Jan should’ve been here with him.

00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:45.403
All I can do is take care of him.

00:01:49.324 --> 00:01:50.897
He’s my friend after all.

00:03:30.785 --> 00:03:33.424
Jinn, my mom says it’s time to eat.

00:03:37.693 --> 00:03:39.769
Jinn, do you hear me?

00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:47.891
Jinn!

00:03:57.846 --> 00:03:58.535
Jinn.

00:04:01.933 --> 00:04:02.634
Jinn.

00:04:03.985 --> 00:04:05.536
If you don’t answer, I’m coming in.

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:18.017
Jinn, where did you go?

00:04:24.377 --> 00:04:27.417
(Don’t look for me.
I’ll live my life somewhere.)

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:30.482
(One day, I’ll come back. — Jinn)

00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:36.866
J.

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:37.995
J.

00:04:41.437 --> 00:04:42.300
Jinn, don’t go.

00:04:53.141 --> 00:04:53.672
J.

00:04:56.896 --> 00:04:57.876
Did you have a bad dream, son?

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.717
Huh?

00:05:14.157 --> 00:05:15.107
Yes, Mom.

00:05:16.131 --> 00:05:17.647
But I don’t remember it now.

00:05:20.762 --> 00:05:21.805
Does anything hurt, sweetheart?

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:24.671
Not anymore.

00:05:25.412 --> 00:05:27.567
I’ll be able to run tomorrow.

00:05:29.854 --> 00:05:32.713
I requested the surveillance footage
from the scene,

00:05:32.887 --> 00:05:34.490
so we’ll know what really happened.

00:05:36.233 --> 00:05:37.547
Thank you so much, Auntie Jan.

00:05:39.616 --> 00:05:41.400
Dad went to file a report at the police station.

00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:43.013
He’ll be back later.

00:05:43.231 --> 00:05:44.827
Let me stay with you tonight.

00:05:46.875 --> 00:05:48.068
It’s okay, Mom.

00:05:48.961 --> 00:05:49.838
I’m all good here.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.633
If you sleep on that hard sofa,

00:05:52.851 --> 00:05:55.159
you’ll be the next patient
waiting for slipped-disc treatment.

00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:57.792
I’m not that old.

00:05:58.424 --> 00:06:01.035
Don’t hit him so hard. He’s injured.

00:06:04.128 --> 00:06:05.312
I’m reall fine.

00:06:05.748 --> 00:06:07.760
You can go home and let Dad comfort you.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.652
Hey, don’t tease your mom.

00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:16.022
When you were little, she’d keep applying
medicine again and again for just an ant bite.

00:06:16.022 --> 00:06:17.968
But this time you got hit by a car.

00:06:18.295 --> 00:06:19.433
How could she not cry?

00:06:22.221 --> 00:06:27.933
If it were me,
I’d definitely react the same way.

00:06:49.138 --> 00:06:50.182
Please.

00:06:54.974 --> 00:06:57.317
Mom, Auntie Jen, you can go home.

00:06:57.317 --> 00:06:59.012
Our friends are coming to visit J,

00:06:59.142 --> 00:07:00.831
so I’ll stay a bit longer.

00:07:01.484 --> 00:07:03.096
Then take good care of him for me, dear.

00:07:03.488 --> 00:07:04.418
Sure, Auntie Jen.

00:07:04.658 --> 00:07:06.116
Don’t worry.

00:07:06.312 --> 00:07:08.330
The doctor said J isn’t seriously injured,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.219
so please don’t stress.

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:14.636
And tomorrow, once he’s discharged,
I’ll drive extra safe and slow to take J home.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.137
I don’t think Auntie Jen
is stressed about anything…

00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:22.609
except the part
where you said “extra safe and slow.”

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:25.830
Come on, Mom. I’m trying to be cool here.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.600
I do want both of you to drive carefully.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.769
J is in there because of a reckless driver.

00:07:32.769 --> 00:07:35.589
So, let’s not be the cause of
anyone else’s injury, okay?

00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:37.256
Of course, Auntie Jen.

00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:41.667
I promise I’ll drive so slowly
even a turtle could pass me.

00:07:41.885 --> 00:07:43.651
- Okay.
- Is that sarcasm?

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:45.333
Come on.

00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:46.252
Let me walk you out.

00:07:46.252 --> 00:07:47.788
Let’s go, you two gorgeous ladies.

00:07:47.788 --> 00:07:49.454
This way, please.

00:07:49.781 --> 00:07:51.136
The elevator is on your left.

00:07:51.136 --> 00:07:52.670
Go straight first and then turn left.

00:07:57.201 --> 00:07:59.096
Good, you’re here.
Can you get me some water?

00:08:29.532 --> 00:08:32.151
I really can’t remember the dream.

00:08:33.262 --> 00:08:34.443
I’m not doubting that.

00:08:36.098 --> 00:08:37.221
What do you mean?

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:40.238
You skipped class today.

00:08:41.349 --> 00:08:43.165
What were you doing at my mom’s boutique?

00:08:46.476 --> 00:08:47.556
About Uncle Jet…

00:08:48.536 --> 00:08:50.027
When are you planning to tell Jinn?

00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:52.730
How did you find out, dear?

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:53.967
When did you learn about this?

00:08:54.882 --> 00:08:55.535
Well?

00:08:56.254 --> 00:08:57.936
Why did you go to my mom’s boutique?

00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:01.548
I…

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.032
I just…

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.009
How’re you holding up?

00:09:18.684 --> 00:09:20.535
I thought I’d be one friend short today.

00:09:20.709 --> 00:09:22.409
In your f*cking dreams, dude.

00:09:27.507 --> 00:09:29.745
That’s totally an old-people get-well gift.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.897
See? I told you.

00:09:32.158 --> 00:09:35.365
We should’ve saved this basket for
our professor when he grades our work.

00:09:37.347 --> 00:09:38.529
What do you want to eat then?

00:09:39.073 --> 00:09:40.693
Or drink instead?

00:09:42.152 --> 00:09:44.439
You guys can’t get any worse.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:46.905
We’re kidding.

00:09:46.905 --> 00:09:48.401
Food has been ordered for us all.

00:09:48.837 --> 00:09:49.843
Is it even edible?

00:09:49.843 --> 00:09:50.685
Hey, dude.

00:09:50.837 --> 00:09:53.041
It is. I ordered it.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:54.299
Fine then.

00:09:58.917 --> 00:09:59.847
Food’s here.

00:10:00.849 --> 00:10:01.634
Jinn.

00:10:02.244 --> 00:10:03.478
Can you come get it with me?

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:04.635
Yeah, sure.

00:10:05.092 --> 00:10:08.709
Hey, you two can’t leave me alone with Van.

00:10:09.123 --> 00:10:11.071
My wounds will just get more infected.

00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:13.013
Come on, they won’t burst open.

00:10:13.013 --> 00:10:14.191
You don’t even have surgical wounds.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.216
Why?

00:10:16.761 --> 00:10:19.938
What’s wrong with being alone with me?

00:10:19.938 --> 00:10:20.631
Nothing.

00:10:20.827 --> 00:10:21.536
Be nice to him.

00:10:27.243 --> 00:10:28.543
What are you doing, Van?

00:10:29.806 --> 00:10:31.086
Don’t.

00:10:31.478 --> 00:10:32.441
Let me see your wound.

00:10:32.441 --> 00:10:33.772
No. Van, don’t!

00:10:34.534 --> 00:10:36.558
- Let me see.
- No.

00:10:39.912 --> 00:10:40.637
Come on.

00:10:42.358 --> 00:10:42.992
Jinn.

00:10:44.582 --> 00:10:45.799
What did the doctor say?

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:48.658
He’ll be fine.

00:10:48.985 --> 00:10:51.354
His head did hit the floor, though.

00:10:52.138 --> 00:10:54.233
But he had an X-ray. Nothing seems wrong.

00:10:55.671 --> 00:10:59.366
Your fates are really intertwined.

00:11:00.847 --> 00:11:01.582
Just a coincidence, I guess.

00:11:02.976 --> 00:11:03.642
Hey.

00:11:04.557 --> 00:11:06.018
J told me everything.

00:11:07.238 --> 00:11:08.239
This is unbelievable.

00:11:12.334 --> 00:11:15.273
J told you about his superpower?

00:11:15.447 --> 00:11:17.441
You guys call it that?

00:11:20.578 --> 00:11:22.735
Yeah. He was the one who named it.

00:11:22.953 --> 00:11:25.928
Didn’t he see it before he got hit by that car?

00:11:26.538 --> 00:11:27.689
Like when he helped you?

00:11:30.346 --> 00:11:31.185
I don’t know.

00:11:31.904 --> 00:11:34.318
Honestly, I haven’t had
the chance to talk to him yet.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.968
It’s his superpower,
and he can’t even use it to help himself.

00:11:41.758 --> 00:11:43.134
- Farm.
- Hm?

00:11:45.007 --> 00:11:47.257
Do you think J ended up like this

00:11:48.411 --> 00:11:50.063
because he helped me?

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:51.595
You’re overthinking it, Jinn.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:55.093
Look at where we are right now.

00:11:55.681 --> 00:11:56.851
Should we underthink it?

00:11:57.504 --> 00:12:00.052
It might be just a coincidence or an accident.

00:12:00.488 --> 00:12:01.859
No, I’m…

00:12:03.057 --> 00:12:05.687
I’m afraid he’s trading his life for mine.

00:12:07.168 --> 00:12:08.511
You’re reading too much into it, Jinn.

00:12:09.469 --> 00:12:10.588
This is real life.

00:12:11.089 --> 00:12:12.712
Stuff like that doesn’t happen.

00:12:14.934 --> 00:12:18.471
But in real life right now, J can see the future.

00:12:20.954 --> 00:12:21.888
I don’t know, man.

00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:28.418
I’m glad they finally left.

00:12:28.592 --> 00:12:30.097
They always exhaust me.

00:12:34.083 --> 00:12:35.529
Get some rest.

00:12:36.575 --> 00:12:39.291
If everything goes well, you can be
discharged late tomorrow morning.

00:12:43.822 --> 00:12:46.457
Are you still worried?

00:12:48.007 --> 00:12:48.769
No.

00:12:52.777 --> 00:12:55.016
I went to Auntie Jan’s shop
to pick up some things.

00:12:55.561 --> 00:12:57.134
When I left, a car hit me.

00:12:57.548 --> 00:12:59.099
Then I woke up here.

00:13:07.857 --> 00:13:08.539
What now?

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:14.997
Actually, no.

00:13:16.065 --> 00:13:16.935
It just grazed me.

00:13:19.592 --> 00:13:23.064
Hit or grazed, you almost died.

00:13:25.243 --> 00:13:27.452
If I died, I wouldn’t be hugging you right now.

00:13:27.931 --> 00:13:28.609
Hm?

00:13:30.417 --> 00:13:32.651
How did the accident happen anyway?

00:13:38.841 --> 00:13:39.537
J.

00:13:41.497 --> 00:13:42.343
J.

00:13:44.434 --> 00:13:45.153
J.

00:13:46.504 --> 00:13:47.186
What’s wrong?

00:13:49.908 --> 00:13:50.746
Nothing.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.092
I just want to hug you tight.

00:13:54.007 --> 00:13:54.824
Is it too tight?

00:13:56.523 --> 00:13:57.262
Yes.

00:13:58.177 --> 00:14:00.604
It feels like getting wrapped by a snake.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.725
Well, because I love you.

00:14:12.738 --> 00:14:13.533
What are you doing?

00:14:14.557 --> 00:14:16.615
It’s not every day
we get to wear matching outfits.

00:14:16.942 --> 00:14:17.621
What?

00:14:17.904 --> 00:14:19.050
Matching outfits?

00:14:20.117 --> 00:14:20.820
How?

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:22.351
Our bandages.

00:14:27.797 --> 00:14:28.496
Done.

00:14:29.542 --> 00:14:30.727
This is so heart-fluttering.

00:14:33.579 --> 00:14:34.514
Right?

00:14:34.906 --> 00:14:35.987
I was being sarcastic, dipshit.

00:14:38.977 --> 00:14:39.955
Let me see the photo.

00:14:49.618 --> 00:14:52.099
You took my notebook
and forbade me from looking.

00:14:52.099 --> 00:14:53.061
You didn’t look, did you?

00:14:53.061 --> 00:14:55.050
Why? Is there a secret?

00:14:56.836 --> 00:14:58.537
That means in two years,

00:14:58.537 --> 00:15:02.015
Auntie Jan will die
and you will disappear, Jinn?

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:21.652
What are you doing?

00:15:22.565 --> 00:15:23.226
What?

00:15:23.226 --> 00:15:25.081
Hey, I’m sorry.

00:15:29.421 --> 00:15:30.961
Are you stressed? Why are you smoking?

00:15:32.136 --> 00:15:32.855
No reason.

00:15:33.694 --> 00:15:35.046
Just felt like it.

00:15:36.444 --> 00:15:37.682
I didn’t know you were a heavy smoker.

00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:39.933
Not that heavy.

00:15:40.678 --> 00:15:42.330
I just came out here
to have a phone call with my dad.

00:15:42.591 --> 00:15:44.935
I saw a pack lying around, so…

00:15:46.482 --> 00:15:47.123
What did you talk about?

00:15:50.123 --> 00:15:51.014
Why do you want to know?

00:15:51.573 --> 00:15:54.028
You never tell your friends about your family.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:55.976
All we know is you’re loaded.

00:15:56.125 --> 00:15:57.521
And that’s it.

00:15:57.633 --> 00:15:58.734
That is it.

00:15:59.312 --> 00:16:00.859
I don’t know what else to say.

00:16:01.623 --> 00:16:03.112
I’ve never seen you go home.

00:16:05.497 --> 00:16:06.682
I’m not welcome there.

00:16:08.098 --> 00:16:11.960
Your life totally fits
the spoiled rich boy stereotype.

00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:13.100
How?

00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:16.283
Rich, but you don’t get along with your family.

00:16:16.786 --> 00:16:19.726
You’re mysterious; you never post anything.

00:16:20.006 --> 00:16:22.012
You’re like a rare white elephant.

00:16:24.099 --> 00:16:25.198
I’ll post something now then.

00:16:30.617 --> 00:16:31.589
What are you doing?

00:16:32.297 --> 00:16:33.757
Posting it on my Stories. Why?

00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:36.966
Nothing.

00:16:37.395 --> 00:16:39.085
I just…

00:16:40.632 --> 00:16:41.350
I…

00:16:41.797 --> 00:16:42.527
I don’t want—

00:16:42.527 --> 00:16:43.730
What happened to your arm?

00:16:57.606 --> 00:16:59.773
But you told your mom
you could sleep alone.

00:16:59.922 --> 00:17:01.312
I changed my mind.

00:17:01.424 --> 00:17:03.893
I don’t have clothes. I didn’t bring anything.

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:06.747
Come on. Don’t be cruel.

00:17:08.499 --> 00:17:11.226
Then I’ll go home for a shower and clothes.

00:17:11.338 --> 00:17:12.588
I’ll be back in an hour.

00:17:14.097 --> 00:17:14.795
Okay?

00:17:18.392 --> 00:17:19.654
You’re the best.

00:17:20.437 --> 00:17:21.847
So you’ll stop all the nuisance.

00:17:23.841 --> 00:17:24.708
I’m going.

00:17:24.708 --> 00:17:26.322
Mm. Come back quick.

00:17:28.111 --> 00:17:28.894
Jinn, wait.

00:17:34.056 --> 00:17:35.304
Can you grab one thing for me?

00:17:41.729 --> 00:17:44.414
I didn’t know you were
allergic to cigarette smoke.

00:17:45.793 --> 00:17:48.206
Well, you never asked.

00:17:51.747 --> 00:17:54.386
It’s just a rash. It’ll go away soon.

00:17:54.852 --> 00:17:56.543
So what do you do when you go to bars?

00:17:57.307 --> 00:17:58.400
I take pills beforehand.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:58.956
What?

00:17:59.329 --> 00:18:00.891
Pills before drinking?

00:18:01.171 --> 00:18:01.671
What?

00:18:02.342 --> 00:18:03.056
I’m not supposed to?

00:18:03.205 --> 00:18:05.343
It’s common knowledge.

00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:07.865
Come on. Go easy on me.

00:18:07.865 --> 00:18:09.049
Don’t be so harsh.

00:18:09.198 --> 00:18:10.592
You know I’m dumb.

00:18:12.661 --> 00:18:13.944
Rub it for me.

00:18:17.876 --> 00:18:19.165
Yeah, I applied it for you,

00:18:19.165 --> 00:18:20.437
and now I have to rub it too.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.708
Where else does it itch?

00:18:23.584 --> 00:18:25.926
A little on my back.

00:18:34.136 --> 00:18:35.566
Is there anything else I should know?

00:18:36.871 --> 00:18:37.516
What?

00:18:38.206 --> 00:18:41.282
Is there anything else
about you that I don’t know?

00:18:45.055 --> 00:18:47.665
You don’t have to be so serious.

00:18:48.466 --> 00:18:50.298
I have an allergy. I take pills. That’s it.

00:18:53.615 --> 00:18:55.302
But you are my boyfriend now.

00:18:56.551 --> 00:19:00.225
If dating me doesn’t make your life better,
then why bother?

00:19:02.014 --> 00:19:04.384
Hey, that sounds a bit much.

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:10.237
Fine. Okay.

00:19:11.001 --> 00:19:12.358
From now on, whatever it is, I’ll tell you.

00:19:12.936 --> 00:19:14.106
I just can’t think of anything right now.

00:19:15.373 --> 00:19:18.921
Once I do, I’ll make you a list. Okay?

00:19:21.325 --> 00:19:23.121
I want this to be good.

00:19:23.978 --> 00:19:28.749
Because I know how scary bad love can be.

00:19:33.259 --> 00:19:34.528
Okay, sir.

00:20:01.838 --> 00:20:02.614
Did you peek?

00:20:04.403 --> 00:20:05.644
You took my notebook

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:07.350
and forbade me from looking.

00:20:07.779 --> 00:20:08.983
Are you crazy?

00:20:09.207 --> 00:20:10.468
You didn’t look, did you?

00:20:11.307 --> 00:20:12.829
No, I didn’t.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.168
Why? Is there a secret?

00:20:20.162 --> 00:20:20.856
No.

00:20:22.123 --> 00:20:23.691
I just wrote my love confession.

00:20:24.455 --> 00:20:28.669
So when you open it, you’ll blush.

00:20:29.098 --> 00:20:29.736
Idiot.

00:20:44.341 --> 00:20:45.520
I’m going to sleep. Goodnight.

00:20:46.731 --> 00:20:47.801
Yeah. Goodnight.

00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:34.408
Calm down, J.

00:22:15.081 --> 00:22:18.021
(Don’t look for me.
I’ll live my life somewhere.)

00:22:18.114 --> 00:22:20.353
(One day, I’ll come back. — Jinn)

00:22:21.863 --> 00:22:23.660
Graduation is just a few days away.

00:22:24.163 --> 00:22:25.558
Auntie Jan should’ve been here with him.

00:22:29.025 --> 00:22:30.620
That means in two years,

00:22:32.185 --> 00:22:33.259
Auntie Jan will die

00:22:35.626 --> 00:22:38.270
and you will disappear, Jinn?

00:22:42.873 --> 00:22:44.419
I will change everything.

00:22:45.779 --> 00:22:46.602
I promise.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.260
I thought you were at Auntie Jen’s house.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.010
Why would I be?

00:22:56.364 --> 00:22:58.374
You and J have been sticking together lately,

00:22:58.374 --> 00:23:00.172
so I thought you might want to look after him.

00:23:00.768 --> 00:23:01.758
That shithead’s got hands and feet.

00:23:02.074 --> 00:23:03.056
Let him take care of himself.

00:23:03.783 --> 00:23:04.640
Hey, language.

00:23:04.708 --> 00:23:06.773
I’m sorry, ma’am.

00:23:09.708 --> 00:23:11.780
(Let’s move on to our latest news.)

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:18.251
(Jet Kueanarakool appeared
at a CSR event for J Group,)

00:23:18.251 --> 00:23:21.330
(the family business he took over)

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.426
(after resigning from
the entertainment industry years ago.)

00:23:23.426 --> 00:23:25.208
(This activity …)

00:23:25.208 --> 00:23:27.421
Wow, your dad still looks hot.
(...benefit children across the country.)

00:23:29.881 --> 00:23:30.381
What?

00:23:30.605 --> 00:23:31.105
Mom.

00:23:32.111 --> 00:23:32.819
What?

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.693
Don’t you think it’s a shame?

00:23:36.271 --> 00:23:38.245
You almost had a famous last name.

00:23:39.382 --> 00:23:40.279
No.

00:23:40.652 --> 00:23:41.751
Why would I?

00:23:44.565 --> 00:23:47.271
It’s been ten years.

00:23:47.271 --> 00:23:49.310
You shouldn’t still hold a grudge
against your dad.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.558
I told you I only have you as a parent.

00:23:52.707 --> 00:23:54.358
A mom alone can’t make a child.

00:23:55.774 --> 00:23:58.982
Can you stop trying to push me
toward someone who never wanted me?

00:23:59.821 --> 00:24:01.516
Why would you say that, dear?

00:24:02.522 --> 00:24:04.022
I might’ve been young,

00:24:04.838 --> 00:24:06.098
but I remember every word.

00:24:07.701 --> 00:24:09.152
Let me know if you need anything, Jan.

00:24:09.972 --> 00:24:10.472
Sure.

00:24:11.385 --> 00:24:12.226
Go on.

00:24:13.009 --> 00:24:14.204
We will be fine.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:19.676
Where are you going, Dad?

00:24:28.211 --> 00:24:29.875
Do you want this uncle to be your dad?

00:24:32.354 --> 00:24:33.395
I’m not your father.

00:24:33.917 --> 00:24:35.183
I can’t be.

00:24:44.631 --> 00:24:45.591
Dad!

00:24:46.076 --> 00:24:46.653
Dad!

00:24:46.653 --> 00:24:47.306
Jinn.

00:24:47.306 --> 00:24:48.576
I’m going to talk to Dad!

00:24:48.576 --> 00:24:50.039
- Jinn, don’t go.
- Let go!

00:24:50.039 --> 00:24:50.989
Jinn.

00:24:51.175 --> 00:24:51.998
Let go!

00:24:52.371 --> 00:24:53.117
Jinn.

00:24:53.303 --> 00:24:54.786
I wanna go see Dad.

00:24:54.935 --> 00:24:56.050
Don’t, son.

00:24:57.945 --> 00:24:59.765
He said himself he wasn’t my dad.

00:25:01.964 --> 00:25:02.668
Jinn,

00:25:03.618 --> 00:25:05.533
here’s the story. Your dad was—

00:25:05.533 --> 00:25:07.325
Can we not talk about this, Mom?

00:25:09.561 --> 00:25:10.810
Please.

00:25:12.003 --> 00:25:13.536
It’s enough for me to have just you.

00:25:18.251 --> 00:25:19.962
Mm.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:24.040
We’ve managed just fine, the two of us.

00:25:25.531 --> 00:25:26.210
Exactly.

00:25:26.788 --> 00:25:28.425
You raised me so well.

00:25:28.965 --> 00:25:31.059
You’re a super wonderful woman.

00:25:35.084 --> 00:25:36.708
With flattery like that,
do you want something?

00:25:37.621 --> 00:25:38.888
It’s a real compliment.

00:25:38.888 --> 00:25:39.981
You really are great.

00:25:41.099 --> 00:25:43.135
You raised me without him,
and you did it well.

00:25:45.129 --> 00:25:49.011
So, can you please not talk about him?

00:25:58.394 --> 00:25:59.943
I don’t like it when Mom talks about him.

00:25:59.943 --> 00:26:01.059
What if he regrets it?

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:02.536
Would you forgive him?

00:26:02.536 --> 00:26:04.814
You should at least let him explain.

00:26:04.814 --> 00:26:06.251
Are you taking his side?

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.674
It’s not that.

00:26:08.159 --> 00:26:10.463
I just want you to
look at it from another angle.

00:26:55.414 --> 00:26:58.522
Every time you can’t sleep,
you become my burden.

00:26:59.010 --> 00:26:59.768
Says who?

00:27:04.672 --> 00:27:07.523
Are you sure I’m the one who can’t sleep?

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:15.333
What?

00:27:15.996 --> 00:27:17.308
What did my mom tell you?

00:27:19.522 --> 00:27:20.091
Hm?

00:27:33.061 --> 00:27:34.629
I don’t like it when she talks about him.

00:27:38.918 --> 00:27:39.853
Self-willed kiddo.

00:27:45.066 --> 00:27:46.657
Your family is warm.

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:48.361
You don’t get it.

00:27:54.314 --> 00:27:56.390
Auntie Jan raised you well, though.

00:27:57.454 --> 00:28:01.106
She did. That’s why I don’t need a father.

00:28:03.094 --> 00:28:04.436
What if he regrets it?

00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:07.686
Would you forgive him?

00:28:10.406 --> 00:28:12.696
You should at least let him explain.

00:28:15.276 --> 00:28:19.058
You sound like you know something.

00:28:19.511 --> 00:28:20.013
Hm?

00:28:27.127 --> 00:28:27.846
No.

00:28:29.537 --> 00:28:30.656
I’m just saying.

00:28:32.992 --> 00:28:34.440
It’s been a long time.

00:28:34.928 --> 00:28:36.496
He was an actor back then.

00:28:36.566 --> 00:28:42.177
And at the time, having a partner
and a kid was a big deal.

00:28:49.934 --> 00:28:50.901
So…

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.630
you’re taking his side?

00:28:53.136 --> 00:28:54.237
It’s not that.

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:57.030
I just want you to
look at it from another angle.

00:29:00.395 --> 00:29:01.661
Did you dream about him?

00:29:02.794 --> 00:29:03.832
What happened in it?

00:29:04.634 --> 00:29:07.805
Did I forgive him… or chase him away?

00:29:09.461 --> 00:29:10.599
You’re not my dad!

00:29:10.599 --> 00:29:11.218
Jinn.

00:29:11.218 --> 00:29:12.305
And I’m not your son!

00:29:12.305 --> 00:29:12.992
- J.
- (Jinn.)

00:29:14.875 --> 00:29:15.951
I didn’t dream about anything.

00:29:16.195 --> 00:29:17.077
Just sleep.

00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:18.541
Just sleep, okay?

00:29:26.083 --> 00:29:26.749
Hey.

00:29:27.516 --> 00:29:30.087
You don’t tell me about your dreams lately.

00:29:30.976 --> 00:29:31.641
Why?

00:29:32.583 --> 00:29:33.582
Have you been seeing something bad?

00:29:37.348 --> 00:29:39.574
You made me take the sleeping pills.

00:29:39.853 --> 00:29:40.681
That’s why I don’t dream.

00:29:42.058 --> 00:29:43.135
So they work?

00:29:44.791 --> 00:29:46.119
Yes, they do.

00:29:47.688 --> 00:29:48.711
I sleep like a log.

00:29:50.542 --> 00:29:52.523
I took some before I came to see you.

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:55.475
And now I’m getting sleepy.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:57.585
I’m going to sleep.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:02.353
Yeah.

00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:03.443
Goodnight.

00:30:51.113 --> 00:30:53.507
J, you’re tough as nails.

00:30:53.943 --> 00:30:55.903
You got hit by a car,
and you’re already back in class.

00:30:56.147 --> 00:30:57.362
It just grazed me.

00:30:58.129 --> 00:30:59.015
Don’t overreact.

00:30:59.608 --> 00:31:01.503
How’s the lawsuit going?

00:31:02.479 --> 00:31:03.372
No idea.

00:31:04.087 --> 00:31:05.449
My dad’s handling it.

00:31:06.321 --> 00:31:07.678
I don’t want to deal with it. Total headache.

00:31:11.496 --> 00:31:12.281
Guys,

00:31:12.577 --> 00:31:15.291
the freshmen are working on their project.

00:31:15.291 --> 00:31:17.370
They need someone to model for them.

00:31:17.754 --> 00:31:19.210
They asked if you are interested.

00:31:20.657 --> 00:31:21.464
All of us?

00:31:22.231 --> 00:31:23.906
Just one volunteer is fine.

00:31:23.906 --> 00:31:26.415
Your bodies are fire. They’re impressed.

00:31:28.577 --> 00:31:29.271
Then…

00:31:30.596 --> 00:31:31.271
I’ll pass.

00:31:32.003 --> 00:31:33.009
Same. Pass.

00:31:33.584 --> 00:31:34.223
Not interested.

00:31:36.751 --> 00:31:37.992
So it’s the freshmen’s project, huh?

00:31:38.846 --> 00:31:39.788
Who exactly?

00:31:39.997 --> 00:31:41.314
Nina and her group.

00:31:41.314 --> 00:31:42.238
Do you know her?

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:45.367
Ah!

00:31:46.343 --> 00:31:47.812
She already has my contact.

00:31:48.003 --> 00:31:49.355
Tell her to send me the details directly.

00:31:49.564 --> 00:31:51.208
Are you gonna charge a lot?

00:31:51.208 --> 00:31:52.499
I’ll let her know.

00:31:53.127 --> 00:31:53.875
Not telling you.

00:31:54.381 --> 00:31:55.716
Nina can ask me herself.

00:31:56.169 --> 00:31:58.587
Have it your way then. I’ll pass it on.

00:32:00.906 --> 00:32:01.797
Ahem.

00:32:03.471 --> 00:32:06.010
A gallant man spotted.

00:32:06.428 --> 00:32:07.896
It’s called being friendly.

00:32:08.245 --> 00:32:09.472
I’m not gallant.

00:32:17.621 --> 00:32:18.358
It’s hot today.

00:32:22.525 --> 00:32:23.231
Hey, guys.

00:32:24.417 --> 00:32:25.645
Nina needs my body measurements.

00:32:27.458 --> 00:32:28.407
You said yes just now.

00:32:28.546 --> 00:32:29.651
The project already started?

00:32:30.314 --> 00:32:30.814
Yeah.

00:32:31.232 --> 00:32:32.341
I’m off now.

00:32:32.637 --> 00:32:33.555
Should I wait?

00:32:34.706 --> 00:32:35.968
It’s okay. It might take a while.

00:32:35.968 --> 00:32:37.705
It’s fine. I can wait.

00:32:38.329 --> 00:32:39.225
Really, it’s okay.

00:32:39.521 --> 00:32:41.032
Nina said she’d treat me to a meal after.

00:32:41.171 --> 00:32:41.980
You can leave without me.

00:32:43.329 --> 00:32:44.387
Alright, I’m off then.

00:32:44.945 --> 00:32:45.818
See you.

00:32:49.218 --> 00:32:50.838
I think something’s up.

00:32:53.157 --> 00:32:54.076
Should we go?

00:32:54.599 --> 00:32:55.342
Yeah, let’s.

00:33:06.354 --> 00:33:08.616
WANT ME TO PICK YOU UP?

00:33:46.325 --> 00:33:47.675
You’re acting like a baby.

00:33:48.791 --> 00:33:49.839
I’m not.

00:33:50.833 --> 00:33:52.286
Look at my wound.

00:33:53.071 --> 00:33:54.689
It’s just a scrape.

00:33:55.857 --> 00:33:57.706
Do you seriously
need me to help you bathe?

00:33:58.177 --> 00:33:59.250
What a loser.

00:34:00.401 --> 00:34:02.117
You helped me before.

00:34:03.329 --> 00:34:05.095
That was when you broke your finger.

00:34:05.095 --> 00:34:08.612
And I wanted you to recover fast
so you’d go home.

00:34:12.483 --> 00:34:14.082
What about now?

00:34:14.653 --> 00:34:15.941
You don’t want me gone anymore?

00:34:17.005 --> 00:34:17.640
Hm?

00:34:19.959 --> 00:34:21.420
Bug me one more time,

00:34:21.594 --> 00:34:23.169
and I’ll drown you in the tub.

00:34:26.377 --> 00:34:27.068
Jinn.

00:34:27.591 --> 00:34:28.224
Yeah?

00:34:30.543 --> 00:34:31.816
When do you think…

00:34:33.682 --> 00:34:35.127
you’ll tell people about us?

00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:39.106
You posted a photo like that.

00:34:40.658 --> 00:34:42.037
It’s basically public already.

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:43.923
I mean, with our parents.

00:34:46.765 --> 00:34:47.544
Right.

00:34:48.189 --> 00:34:49.871
I never really thought about it.

00:34:51.492 --> 00:34:53.152
But we have no reason to hide it.

00:34:53.815 --> 00:34:54.741
Except…

00:34:55.247 --> 00:34:55.972
Except what?

00:34:58.082 --> 00:34:59.070
It’s embarrassing.

00:34:59.419 --> 00:35:01.541
We hated each other
and then ended up together.

00:35:01.855 --> 00:35:04.865
Our moms will laugh
about it in this life and the next.

00:35:06.312 --> 00:35:07.269
You’ve got a point.

00:35:07.618 --> 00:35:09.194
It’s so embarrassing.

00:35:10.658 --> 00:35:11.264
Mm.

00:35:12.973 --> 00:35:15.860
Is that all you’re planning to tell them?

00:35:18.179 --> 00:35:19.086
What do you mean?

00:35:21.143 --> 00:35:22.352
What about seeing the future?

00:35:22.753 --> 00:35:23.716
Are you telling them?

00:35:24.658 --> 00:35:26.340
I don’t know how to start.

00:35:30.911 --> 00:35:31.921
Let’s get you cleaned up.

00:35:44.595 --> 00:35:45.861
Van is skipping?

00:35:46.018 --> 00:35:47.581
He didn’t come back last night.

00:35:48.329 --> 00:35:49.230
Gosh.

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:52.481
Did taking body measurements
require spending the night?

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:18.573
Van is skipping?

00:36:19.807 --> 00:36:20.340
I don’t know.

00:36:25.776 --> 00:36:27.323
You guys aren’t sharing the place anymore?

00:36:27.661 --> 00:36:29.333
He didn’t come back last night.

00:36:32.934 --> 00:36:34.204
He behaved for three days,

00:36:35.034 --> 00:36:36.587
and now his true colors are back?

00:36:39.528 --> 00:36:40.562
Here he comes.

00:36:41.052 --> 00:36:41.788
Gosh.

00:36:46.302 --> 00:36:49.910
Did taking body measurements
require spending the night?

00:36:55.285 --> 00:36:57.918
It got late, so I crashed at a friend’s place.

00:36:58.307 --> 00:36:59.849
It had nothing to do with Nina.

00:36:59.849 --> 00:37:01.980
Oops, I didn’t even mention Nina.

00:37:02.267 --> 00:37:04.726
You were insinuating, dude. I can tell.

00:37:16.008 --> 00:37:17.879
And that was the god of fury.

00:37:19.384 --> 00:37:20.294
I’ll be right back.

00:37:20.294 --> 00:37:21.138
Be right back.

00:37:38.266 --> 00:37:39.621
Don’t be mad.

00:37:39.841 --> 00:37:40.433
Mm.

00:37:42.326 --> 00:37:43.652
I’m really sorry.

00:37:44.987 --> 00:37:46.403
Don’t you think you use
that word a little too often?

00:37:46.758 --> 00:37:48.375
Nothing happened.

00:37:48.747 --> 00:37:50.236
We just had a late-night meal.

00:37:50.236 --> 00:37:52.912
And my friend lives near the restaurant,

00:37:53.166 --> 00:37:54.671
so I decided to crash there.

00:37:54.925 --> 00:37:56.226
You didn’t answer my messages.

00:37:57.477 --> 00:37:58.861
My phone died.

00:37:59.250 --> 00:37:59.884
Oh, yeah?

00:38:01.929 --> 00:38:03.681
You can ask me anything.

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:05.472
I can explain everything.

00:38:06.334 --> 00:38:07.320
Anything?

00:38:07.557 --> 00:38:08.057
Yes.

00:38:08.344 --> 00:38:09.151
Anything.

00:38:11.281 --> 00:38:12.737
Do you really want to be with me?

00:38:15.645 --> 00:38:17.182
Farm, don’t do this.

00:38:17.182 --> 00:38:18.115
I’m serious.

00:38:21.434 --> 00:38:23.116
Of course I do.

00:38:23.386 --> 00:38:24.915
I’m the one who
asked you to be my boyfriend.

00:38:26.183 --> 00:38:27.128
I love you.

00:38:29.765 --> 00:38:30.931
If we break up now,

00:38:31.911 --> 00:38:33.384
we could still go back to being friends.

00:38:36.511 --> 00:38:38.872
Do we really need to go there?

00:38:39.345 --> 00:38:40.695
I just don’t want to lose you.

00:38:41.777 --> 00:38:43.234
Think about it.

00:38:49.235 --> 00:38:49.985
I have thought about it.

00:38:51.473 --> 00:38:52.195
I’m not breaking up.

00:39:24.843 --> 00:39:25.798
- Boo!
- Jeez!

00:39:27.673 --> 00:39:28.626
Hey!

00:39:28.965 --> 00:39:29.713
Hi.

00:39:30.609 --> 00:39:31.932
Did you have something to do around here?

00:39:32.236 --> 00:39:34.748
Yes. We came to buy some fabrics,
so we stopped by.

00:39:35.712 --> 00:39:37.506
- Hi, Auntie Jan.
- Hi, dear.

00:39:38.453 --> 00:39:40.493
You two are always together these days.

00:39:40.561 --> 00:39:42.014
Are you hungry? I can order something.

00:39:52.153 --> 00:39:54.142
Jinn, what’s wrong?

00:39:56.069 --> 00:39:56.949
Ah…

00:39:57.439 --> 00:39:59.076
That suit looks familiar.

00:40:04.181 --> 00:40:05.223
Uh…

00:40:08.435 --> 00:40:11.514
It’s the same one
your dad wore on the news that day.

00:40:12.647 --> 00:40:13.330
Mom.

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:15.798
His secretary brought it in.

00:40:15.967 --> 00:40:18.086
I was hired to work on it.

00:40:19.252 --> 00:40:20.713
How long has he been in touch with you?

00:40:21.761 --> 00:40:22.463
Well.

00:40:24.306 --> 00:40:26.300
This is the third suit of his.

00:40:26.452 --> 00:40:27.041
Third?

00:40:28.495 --> 00:40:29.547
Has he ever come in?

00:40:33.148 --> 00:40:34.876
His secretary handles everything.

00:40:38.139 --> 00:40:40.020
What is he thinking?

00:40:41.575 --> 00:40:42.674
Just forget it.

00:40:42.674 --> 00:40:43.365
Don’t mind him.

00:40:43.737 --> 00:40:45.321
Think of him as a customer.

00:40:50.207 --> 00:40:51.769
Someone’s coming in.

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:54.777
Go wait in the room. I’ll call you down later.

00:40:55.132 --> 00:40:57.064
Hi, welcome.

00:40:58.129 --> 00:41:00.261
Are you looking for something?

00:41:01.191 --> 00:41:02.746
I do have that.

00:41:11.611 --> 00:41:13.904
Do you want to go to the beach after exams?

00:41:16.794 --> 00:41:17.469
What?

00:41:17.739 --> 00:41:19.159
Why are we going to
the beach all of a sudden?

00:41:20.089 --> 00:41:21.830
You’ve seemed moody lately.

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:26.994
Look at everything
that’s been thrown into my life.

00:41:27.095 --> 00:41:28.404
It’s overwhelming.

00:41:29.064 --> 00:41:30.178
It’s hard to force a smile.

00:41:41.511 --> 00:41:42.550
Where are my scissors?

00:41:43.632 --> 00:41:44.829
They might be outside.

00:41:45.201 --> 00:41:46.199
I’ll get them for you.

00:42:02.212 --> 00:42:03.966
Go. Just leave for now.

00:42:05.268 --> 00:42:06.616
Jan, wait— hold on.

00:42:08.577 --> 00:42:09.777
- Just leave.
- Slow down.

00:42:09.777 --> 00:42:10.622
Did you find them?

00:42:12.008 --> 00:42:12.898
Out, please.

00:42:18.324 --> 00:42:19.220
What the hell are you doing?

00:42:20.031 --> 00:42:20.959
I just realized something.

00:42:21.889 --> 00:42:22.517
Realized what?

00:42:25.137 --> 00:42:26.448
A way to make you feel better.

00:42:27.209 --> 00:42:27.709
What?

00:42:27.895 --> 00:42:28.557
J!

00:42:38.495 --> 00:42:39.433
Is this what you want?

00:42:40.025 --> 00:42:41.021
Do you have a problem?

00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:11.697
J, you’re not like this because of me, right?

00:43:12.661 --> 00:43:14.144
Please be okay.

00:43:14.482 --> 00:43:18.410
I swear I’ll be here
annoying you for a very, very long time.

00:43:18.849 --> 00:43:19.694
The fierceness in his eyes.

00:43:19.694 --> 00:43:21.920
I’m scared. Please, help me.

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.282
Let go of Van’s arm already.

00:43:23.282 --> 00:43:25.385
This stupid oil is splashing everywhere.

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:27.156
We can just order food.

00:43:27.274 --> 00:43:29.463
No. I want to cook for you.

00:43:29.463 --> 00:43:31.395
I don’t know how serious you are about us.

00:43:32.105 --> 00:43:35.274
But for me, I want it to work.

00:43:45.271 --> 00:43:46.560
I’ll be fine.

00:43:53.548 --> 00:43:55.144
I’m not letting anything happen to you.

00:43:58.407 --> 00:43:59.247
I love you.

00:44:01.783 --> 00:44:03.054
Do you love me?

00:44:03.054 --> 00:44:04.088
I’ve always loved you.

00:44:05.913 --> 00:44:07.070
Ever since we were seven.
