00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:14.981
What is ‘good love’ anyway?

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.349
Can I even be that for you?

00:00:17.864 --> 00:00:19.322
You wrote in your notebook:

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:23.040
“I finally get it. For you, it can be
anyone in the whole world but me.”

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:24.679
That’s not what I think.

00:00:24.755 --> 00:00:28.799
You promised me you’d forget
everything in that notebook.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.851
I won’t forget it.

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:32.029
Because it helped me
figure out my own feelings too.

00:00:56.671 --> 00:00:59.764
Doing something silly like this
takes me back ten years.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.312
If you like it, just say so.

00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:05.809
I’ll take you on bike rides more often.

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:20.886
For us to have come this far,

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.658
we’re pretty amazing.

00:01:30.448 --> 00:01:31.605
You’re the amazing one.

00:01:36.184 --> 00:01:38.041
If you hadn’t made an effort that day,

00:01:39.395 --> 00:01:40.613
we wouldn’t be here now.

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.931
It was worth it, everything that I did.

00:01:50.887 --> 00:01:51.554
Thank you.

00:04:21.655 --> 00:04:22.435
Asshole.

00:04:23.827 --> 00:04:25.535
My feelings aren’t your toys.

00:04:27.137 --> 00:04:27.864
Why?

00:04:28.512 --> 00:04:29.907
Now that you know I still like you,

00:04:30.365 --> 00:04:31.694
you feel victorious?

00:04:32.133 --> 00:04:33.981
Jinn, it’s not like that.

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.403
Fine. I lost this game.

00:04:38.082 --> 00:04:38.972
Are you happy now?

00:04:40.956 --> 00:04:42.034
Just listen first.

00:04:45.334 --> 00:04:46.592
Don’t you hate my guts?

00:04:47.584 --> 00:04:48.846
We’re always in conflict.

00:04:49.742 --> 00:04:51.895
But today you said you had feelings for me.

00:04:51.895 --> 00:04:53.166
Do you think I’m stupid?

00:04:54.616 --> 00:04:57.059
So I need to be an asshole
in your eyes for the rest of my life?

00:04:58.661 --> 00:04:59.238
Yes.

00:05:00.421 --> 00:05:01.330
You’re a freaking asshole.

00:05:01.425 --> 00:05:03.597
I know you’re a boy, Jerome.

00:05:04.913 --> 00:05:07.545
But why can’t two males get married?

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.736
I still like you, Jerome.

00:05:09.736 --> 00:05:14.858
Jinn likes boys.

00:05:14.858 --> 00:05:16.262
You might say we were just kids back then.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.011
You might forget,

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.699
you might not have meant it,

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.273
or maybe you thought it was nothing.

00:05:23.486 --> 00:05:24.219
But I…

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:26.628
I remember every damn thing!

00:05:30.576 --> 00:05:33.056
Jinn, don’t be like this.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.239
You don’t f*cking know anything.

00:05:35.422 --> 00:05:39.107
Do you know how people at school
looked at me after that day?

00:05:39.202 --> 00:05:40.590
The looks they gave me?

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.827
I’m sorry for what I did.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.680
Sorry, I didn’t remember

00:05:49.405 --> 00:05:51.121
or know what you had to deal with.

00:05:57.034 --> 00:05:59.577
You and I have to go back to how we were.

00:06:01.255 --> 00:06:02.421
We can’t be more than this.

00:06:02.516 --> 00:06:03.203
Jinn.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.337
I’m sorry I lied when I said I hated you.

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:11.047
I promise I’ll make it happen.

00:06:11.562 --> 00:06:12.735
Jinn, it doesn’t have to be like this.

00:06:12.735 --> 00:06:14.017
We’ll compete for the rest of our lives.

00:06:14.627 --> 00:06:15.946
You can beat me all you want.

00:06:16.423 --> 00:06:17.737
Steal my crushes all you want.

00:06:18.023 --> 00:06:19.054
You can do it all.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.808
But one thing I ask—

00:06:23.688 --> 00:06:25.037
don’t play with my feelings.

00:06:30.721 --> 00:06:31.813
It can’t end up like this.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.447
I’LL TRY MY BEST TO HATE YOU,
I SWEAR.

00:08:24.886 --> 00:08:26.180
Mom, where’s Dad?

00:08:27.496 --> 00:08:29.453
There’s a catering order at the restaurant.

00:08:29.453 --> 00:08:30.590
He had to go oversee it.

00:08:31.983 --> 00:08:33.530
And…

00:08:34.884 --> 00:08:35.711
Morning, Auntie Jen.

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:38.772
What made you so moody?

00:08:40.546 --> 00:08:41.174
Nothing.

00:08:42.566 --> 00:08:43.732
Nothing, it is.

00:08:46.841 --> 00:08:48.158
Smile.

00:08:50.981 --> 00:08:51.481
Yes?

00:08:52.892 --> 00:08:57.253
Your mom called me at dawn
and told me to prepare breakfast for you too.

00:08:57.425 --> 00:09:02.123
So this fake mom needs evidence
to show how well I’m taking care of you.

00:09:02.123 --> 00:09:03.288
Smile.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.674
Cute.

00:09:06.323 --> 00:09:08.807
So, you two are heading to uni
together after this, right?

00:09:09.188 --> 00:09:11.997
And you’ll go straight back to
Jinn’s condo after class?

00:09:11.997 --> 00:09:12.724
- Yes.
- Auntie Jen…

00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:16.992
What’s up, honey?

00:09:17.755 --> 00:09:20.354
J has been staying with me
for quite a while already.

00:09:20.926 --> 00:09:24.217
I’d like some privacy.

00:09:25.152 --> 00:09:27.714
So I’m not comfortable
with him staying any longer.

00:09:28.954 --> 00:09:29.647
I’m sorry.

00:09:30.754 --> 00:09:31.580
Goodbye.

00:09:32.457 --> 00:09:33.543
Geez!

00:09:34.459 --> 00:09:36.823
Jinn, be careful, dear.

00:09:38.463 --> 00:09:39.093
See?

00:09:39.093 --> 00:09:40.378
Don’t touch it.

00:09:40.473 --> 00:09:42.121
Let the housemaid take care of that.

00:09:42.731 --> 00:09:43.779
Do you want to dress your wound first?

00:09:44.695 --> 00:09:46.091
It’s alright, Auntie. I should head to uni.

00:09:46.453 --> 00:09:47.114
Goodbye.

00:09:51.308 --> 00:09:52.229
I’m going too, Mom.

00:09:52.229 --> 00:09:53.799
Be careful. Watch your step.

00:09:58.911 --> 00:09:59.856
Jinn, get out.

00:09:59.856 --> 00:10:01.170
What the hell? Leave me alone.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:02.153
Not listening, are you?

00:10:02.382 --> 00:10:03.071
Fine.

00:10:07.668 --> 00:10:09.958
Stop it. Don’t ever get in my car again.

00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.317
You can’t stop me.

00:10:12.671 --> 00:10:13.846
Fine. Is this what you want?

00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:20.805
Oh, shit!

00:10:21.148 --> 00:10:21.811
Jinn!

00:10:26.666 --> 00:10:27.448
Jinn!

00:10:31.091 --> 00:10:31.829
Jinn.

00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:33.058
Jinn, open your eyes.

00:11:00.144 --> 00:11:00.866
Jinn!

00:11:17.066 --> 00:11:18.106
Shit, what the hell was that?

00:11:28.962 --> 00:11:29.640
Are you okay?

00:11:30.632 --> 00:11:32.728
J, what’s going on with you?

00:12:16.351 --> 00:12:18.976
Good morning. Who are you trying to reach?

00:12:19.878 --> 00:12:22.107
(Come on. Are you still sulking?)

00:12:22.839 --> 00:12:24.360
Did you dial the wrong number, ma’am?

00:12:25.166 --> 00:12:27.932
(Jinn, please. Mommy is sorry.)

00:12:28.353 --> 00:12:30.216
Ah, it’s you.

00:12:30.912 --> 00:12:33.975
What business do you have
calling me, ma’am?

00:12:34.085 --> 00:12:36.010
(I really can’t make it back in time,

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:37.955
so I asked Auntie Jen
to prepare breakfast for you too.)

00:12:38.303 --> 00:12:40.561
(Eat at Auntie Jen’s
before heading to uni, okay?)

00:12:46.139 --> 00:12:47.919
It’s fine. I can manage.

00:12:48.175 --> 00:12:50.933
There’s plenty of food around uni.

00:12:50.933 --> 00:12:52.973
(It’ll take forever to get through the traffic.)

00:12:52.973 --> 00:12:54.054
(Then you’ll end up
skipping breakfast again.)

00:12:54.127 --> 00:12:59.256
(I feel guilty enough for leaving
my beloved son home alone.)

00:12:59.256 --> 00:13:00.230
Fine, fine, fine.

00:13:00.487 --> 00:13:03.188
Since this is your first offense,
your punishment is reduced.

00:13:03.188 --> 00:13:06.022
(Aw, does that mean we’re good now?)

00:13:08.183 --> 00:13:10.868
Transfer 20,000 to my account
and we’re completely good.

00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:13.835
(Don’t forget to lock
the door before you leave.)

00:13:13.835 --> 00:13:17.345
♪ If you don’t love me,
Don’t act like you care… ♪

00:13:17.491 --> 00:13:18.011
Jinn.

00:13:23.915 --> 00:13:25.528
20,000THB HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED
TO YOUR ACCOUNT.

00:13:25.986 --> 00:13:26.622
Jeez!

00:13:31.664 --> 00:13:32.337
Thank you.

00:13:33.912 --> 00:13:34.650
Love you, Mom.

00:13:51.466 --> 00:13:53.691
There’s a catering order at the restaurant.

00:13:53.691 --> 00:13:54.848
You can’t stop me.

00:14:19.845 --> 00:14:20.699
Oh, there you are.

00:14:21.706 --> 00:14:23.638
There’s a catering order at the restaurant.

00:14:23.638 --> 00:14:24.817
Dad had to go oversee it.

00:14:39.429 --> 00:14:40.358
Morning, Auntie Jen.

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:43.076
What made you so moody?

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.777
Nothing.

00:14:45.656 --> 00:14:46.708
Nothing, it is.

00:14:49.272 --> 00:14:51.058
Hey, son.

00:14:51.388 --> 00:14:53.000
Why are you just standing there?

00:14:53.348 --> 00:14:54.679
Eat, so you can go to class.

00:15:00.109 --> 00:15:02.288
Smile.

00:15:03.753 --> 00:15:04.415
Yes?

00:15:05.422 --> 00:15:08.177
Your mom called me at dawn

00:15:08.177 --> 00:15:10.307
and told me to prepare breakfast for you too.

00:15:10.655 --> 00:15:14.982
So this fake mom needs evidence
to show how well I’m taking care of you.

00:15:14.982 --> 00:15:16.183
Smile.

00:15:16.842 --> 00:15:18.811
Cute.

00:15:19.196 --> 00:15:21.355
So you two are heading to uni
together after this, right?

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.615
And you’ll go straight back to Jinn’s—

00:15:23.615 --> 00:15:24.988
Let’s get going before we’re late.

00:15:26.013 --> 00:15:26.768
Let go.

00:15:27.153 --> 00:15:28.442
I said let’s go.

00:15:28.534 --> 00:15:29.236
J.

00:15:29.948 --> 00:15:30.739
- Let go!
- Gosh!

00:15:36.552 --> 00:15:37.153
Watch it.

00:15:37.574 --> 00:15:38.265
Ow.

00:15:39.336 --> 00:15:40.026
Does it hurt?

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:41.195
F*ck off.

00:15:46.977 --> 00:15:48.091
What just happened, dear?

00:15:48.091 --> 00:15:48.972
Smile.

00:15:51.023 --> 00:15:51.609
Gosh!

00:15:53.752 --> 00:15:54.252
Ow.

00:15:54.729 --> 00:15:55.415
You can’t stop me.

00:15:58.015 --> 00:15:59.111
I have to go help Jinn.

00:15:59.988 --> 00:16:00.524
Hey.

00:16:06.246 --> 00:16:07.426
Where are you rushing to? Hell?

00:16:10.668 --> 00:16:11.253
Damn it.

00:16:18.045 --> 00:16:19.406
Jinn, get out now.

00:16:20.908 --> 00:16:21.766
Get out.

00:16:21.912 --> 00:16:23.156
What the hell? Move!

00:16:23.156 --> 00:16:23.891
Get out.

00:16:24.202 --> 00:16:25.124
Out of the car.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.252
Not getting out?

00:16:27.827 --> 00:16:28.841
What the f*ck is wrong with you?

00:16:30.196 --> 00:16:30.979
Listen to me.

00:16:32.224 --> 00:16:33.940
You can’t go anywhere today, Jinn.

00:16:35.789 --> 00:16:36.760
Why can’t I?

00:16:43.271 --> 00:16:43.977
Jinn!

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:09.617
Are you alright?

00:17:10.386 --> 00:17:11.066
Are you hurt?

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:13.914
No, I’m fine.

00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:20.568
J, are you alright?

00:17:23.571 --> 00:17:24.306
(Jinn!)

00:17:25.881 --> 00:17:26.878
Jinn, open your eyes.

00:17:26.878 --> 00:17:27.976
(Jinn. Jinn.)

00:17:27.976 --> 00:17:28.603
Hey!

00:17:32.448 --> 00:17:33.079
What’s going on with you?

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.784
It’s good you’re safe.

00:17:43.744 --> 00:17:44.314
J.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:46.624
(Jinn.)

00:17:49.596 --> 00:17:52.091
(Jinn, please be alright.)

00:17:52.384 --> 00:17:52.884
J.

00:17:53.548 --> 00:17:54.190
J.

00:17:54.548 --> 00:17:55.180
J.

00:17:55.418 --> 00:17:56.156
J, are you okay?

00:17:56.156 --> 00:17:57.925
(Jinn, can you hear me?)

00:17:58.035 --> 00:17:58.733
J.

00:17:59.081 --> 00:17:59.913
J, can you hear me?

00:18:04.238 --> 00:18:04.912
J!

00:18:10.955 --> 00:18:12.166
He fainted?

00:18:12.605 --> 00:18:13.369
(Yes.)

00:18:13.369 --> 00:18:14.270
(He’s still out.)

00:18:15.973 --> 00:18:16.727
What happened?

00:18:18.741 --> 00:18:19.932
Our drapings are being graded today.

00:18:20.463 --> 00:18:21.733
I know. I remember that.

00:18:22.026 --> 00:18:24.081
(If you hurry now, you can still
slip in at the end of the line.)

00:18:24.337 --> 00:18:26.733
As for J, I’ll talk to the professor.

00:18:27.099 --> 00:18:28.460
He’s sick. The professor should understand.

00:18:28.588 --> 00:18:29.333
Alright.

00:18:29.333 --> 00:18:30.736
Once he wakes up, I’ll go.

00:18:34.765 --> 00:18:35.583
Auntie Jen,

00:18:36.645 --> 00:18:37.667
should we take him to the hospital?

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.738
You have class, right?

00:18:39.738 --> 00:18:41.076
Go on. I’ll take it from here.

00:18:42.266 --> 00:18:42.861
Okay.

00:18:43.227 --> 00:18:45.624
If anything happens, call me anytime.

00:18:46.484 --> 00:18:47.211
You should get going.

00:18:48.145 --> 00:18:48.711
Goodbye.

00:18:51.659 --> 00:18:52.332
Jinn.

00:18:53.431 --> 00:18:54.765
Mom, you can’t let him go.

00:18:55.113 --> 00:18:55.852
It’s dangerous.

00:18:56.346 --> 00:18:58.768
What’s dangerous? It’s nothing.

00:18:59.262 --> 00:19:00.767
You should worry about yourself.

00:19:01.445 --> 00:19:03.199
Do you want to get a medical check-up?

00:19:15.267 --> 00:19:17.985
J, JINN SAID YOU FAINTED. YOU OK?

00:19:18.644 --> 00:19:19.727
IS JINN THERE YET?

00:19:22.693 --> 00:19:24.470
NO. HOW ARE YOU?

00:19:24.836 --> 00:19:26.862
ONCE HE GETS THERE, LET ME KNOW.

00:19:27.027 --> 00:19:27.712
Jeez.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.688
JINN’S HERE.

00:19:32.391 --> 00:19:33.866
You almost missed it.

00:19:33.866 --> 00:19:35.967
Right. I drove as fast as I could.

00:19:36.718 --> 00:19:38.112
IS HE SAFE?

00:19:48.535 --> 00:19:49.567
HE SEEMS PERFECTLY FINE.

00:19:53.083 --> 00:19:53.962
What’s up?

00:19:54.182 --> 00:19:54.824
Nothing.

00:19:55.318 --> 00:19:56.365
How’s J?

00:19:56.658 --> 00:19:58.200
Right. Is he okay?

00:19:59.848 --> 00:20:01.604
He’d already woken up when I left.

00:20:01.897 --> 00:20:04.008
Is he, like, sick?

00:20:04.338 --> 00:20:05.937
I’ve never seen him sick before.

00:20:06.889 --> 00:20:07.684
I don’t know.

00:20:08.197 --> 00:20:09.542
He was doing fine last night.

00:20:09.743 --> 00:20:11.737
He seemed alright when we had breakfast.

00:20:12.506 --> 00:20:13.786
But suddenly he’s just…

00:20:14.903 --> 00:20:16.780
You can’t go anywhere today, Jinn.

00:20:19.988 --> 00:20:20.657
J!

00:20:23.068 --> 00:20:23.833
You blanked out.

00:20:25.499 --> 00:20:26.248
What’s the matter?

00:20:29.196 --> 00:20:29.874
I think…

00:20:30.826 --> 00:20:32.715
ever since the accident at Tar’s racetrack,

00:20:33.905 --> 00:20:35.106
J’s been acting weird.

00:20:58.815 --> 00:20:59.607
My dear.

00:20:59.915 --> 00:21:01.896
Since we’re already here to remove the cast,

00:21:01.896 --> 00:21:05.624
why don’t you get a full check-up too?

00:21:08.847 --> 00:21:09.463
Come on.

00:21:16.051 --> 00:21:16.749
So?

00:21:17.298 --> 00:21:18.298
What did the doctor say?

00:21:19.397 --> 00:21:21.034
I still can’t carry heavy things.

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:22.457
The rest is fine.

00:21:24.764 --> 00:21:25.506
That’s good.

00:21:30.634 --> 00:21:31.403
What is it?

00:21:31.824 --> 00:21:33.075
Do you still have a headache?

00:21:34.046 --> 00:21:36.141
But didn’t the doctor say you were fine?

00:21:36.141 --> 00:21:37.431
Hm? Let me see.

00:21:42.705 --> 00:21:44.528
You’ve recovered now,
so you’re good to come home, right?

00:21:46.561 --> 00:21:49.243
But we need to have a mutual understanding

00:21:49.499 --> 00:21:52.882
that even if you’re home, I still don’t
feel comfortable with you driving—-

00:21:52.882 --> 00:21:53.571
Mom.

00:21:56.006 --> 00:21:57.896
Will you drop me off at Jinn’s, please?

00:21:58.829 --> 00:21:59.441
Hm?

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.479
I’ll continue staying with him.

00:22:13.423 --> 00:22:14.750
Mediocre looks.

00:22:15.428 --> 00:22:16.724
Obnoxious behavior.

00:22:17.182 --> 00:22:18.571
What’s there to like?

00:22:34.076 --> 00:22:38.363
Maybe I missed it because we were always
getting under each other’s skin before.

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:40.759
But now that I’m with him all the time,

00:22:41.072 --> 00:22:42.489
I feel like…

00:22:43.291 --> 00:22:44.997
he’s, surprisingly, a good person.

00:22:48.635 --> 00:22:51.860
- Aw.
- Aw.

00:22:52.839 --> 00:22:55.217
Don’t tell me you’ve already fallen for him.

00:22:55.856 --> 00:22:58.419
So in the end, you lost to
his hotness like everyone else.

00:22:58.419 --> 00:23:00.064
It’s not that! That’s not true!

00:23:00.945 --> 00:23:02.409
There are five of us in this group.

00:23:02.409 --> 00:23:03.703
Four are dating each other.

00:23:03.703 --> 00:23:05.342
And I’m the leftover side dish. Damn it.

00:23:05.577 --> 00:23:06.299
Mai!

00:23:06.749 --> 00:23:10.029
Sorry, I was just talking nonsense.

00:23:11.497 --> 00:23:13.765
There’s one more weird thing.

00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:14.645
What?

00:23:15.819 --> 00:23:18.217
J keeps waking up at night
because of bad dreams.

00:23:18.648 --> 00:23:20.163
Sometimes he just sits up.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.736
Sometimes he tosses around
then falls asleep again.

00:23:22.736 --> 00:23:23.823
Maybe he’s a sleep talker?

00:23:23.823 --> 00:23:25.065
Lots of people do that.

00:23:25.593 --> 00:23:26.939
Every time I dream…

00:23:27.605 --> 00:23:29.561
there’s always this one person in it,

00:23:29.776 --> 00:23:31.699
just in different situations.

00:23:31.699 --> 00:23:33.229
Everything always comes true.

00:23:34.775 --> 00:23:35.896
Hey, Farm.

00:23:35.896 --> 00:23:36.396
Hm?

00:23:36.611 --> 00:23:37.899
You’re the closest to J.

00:23:38.936 --> 00:23:40.668
Did he tell you anything?

00:23:41.079 --> 00:23:43.171
No. He didn’t say a word.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:44.773
Not even a little bit?

00:23:44.773 --> 00:23:45.273
Right.

00:23:48.894 --> 00:23:50.259
When his car crashed,

00:23:51.257 --> 00:23:53.266
you were the one closest to him, Jinn.

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:57.351
Shouldn’t you be the one
who noticed if anything was weird?

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:03.225
And besides the unusual sleeping stuff,
is there anything else weird that he does?

00:24:04.908 --> 00:24:07.047
Anything weird?

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.675
Don’t tell me…

00:24:19.106 --> 00:24:20.777
That you and he…

00:24:22.871 --> 00:24:23.862
Hit each other.

00:24:24.253 --> 00:24:25.258
Did he hit you?

00:24:25.258 --> 00:24:26.214
Did you hit each other?

00:24:26.449 --> 00:24:27.170
Guys, stop.

00:24:28.657 --> 00:24:29.641
Did you guys kiss?

00:24:35.034 --> 00:24:35.636
Yeah?

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:38.892
Yes, we hit each other.

00:24:39.362 --> 00:24:40.708
We had a fistfight.

00:24:44.837 --> 00:24:46.806
The ones who kissed were you guys.

00:24:46.806 --> 00:24:47.977
Mai!

00:24:47.977 --> 00:24:49.195
Hey, what?

00:24:49.195 --> 00:24:50.252
I’m just coughing.

00:25:10.434 --> 00:25:10.992
What?

00:25:11.892 --> 00:25:13.361
I’m just trying to be a slightly better person.

00:25:13.361 --> 00:25:14.742
You act like you’ve seen a ghost.

00:25:20.754 --> 00:25:22.079
You don’t have to force it.

00:25:22.255 --> 00:25:23.726
You can just be yourself.

00:25:23.726 --> 00:25:24.962
I’m not forcing anything.

00:25:25.373 --> 00:25:27.104
I’m just adjusting.

00:25:27.261 --> 00:25:28.472
Why are you adjusting?

00:25:30.997 --> 00:25:36.300
Can’t I try to be a better person for once, sir?

00:25:59.295 --> 00:26:00.739
I’m going to use the bathroom.

00:26:31.386 --> 00:26:32.414
You came to pack your things?

00:26:53.957 --> 00:26:55.105
Isn’t your hand fully healed?

00:26:57.649 --> 00:26:58.409
No.

00:27:00.288 --> 00:27:01.602
I can see that it’s healed.

00:27:03.853 --> 00:27:04.920
I said it’s not healed.

00:27:05.938 --> 00:27:07.569
Stop screwing with me, J.

00:27:14.169 --> 00:27:15.156
What the hell are you doing, J?

00:27:24.452 --> 00:27:25.561
I said it’s not yet healed.

00:28:07.719 --> 00:28:08.394
Jinn!

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:23.768
Are you gonna toss and turn all night?

00:28:23.768 --> 00:28:24.476
I can’t sleep.

00:28:34.446 --> 00:28:35.304
What a sulky baby.

00:29:27.612 --> 00:29:29.020
Drinking coffee at this hour?

00:29:54.796 --> 00:29:56.480
You can even mess with me in your sleep.

00:29:57.576 --> 00:29:58.959
It’s just in your nature.

00:30:07.856 --> 00:30:09.271
Mediocre looks.

00:30:10.406 --> 00:30:11.662
Not even handsome.

00:30:12.973 --> 00:30:14.111
Obnoxious behavior.

00:30:15.618 --> 00:30:17.144
What’s there to like?

00:30:45.601 --> 00:30:46.282
J?

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.099
Is it happening again?

00:31:02.187 --> 00:31:03.283
It’s just a nightmare.

00:31:08.963 --> 00:31:09.705
Easy.

00:31:12.054 --> 00:31:12.726
It’s okay.

00:31:15.016 --> 00:31:15.898
Go back to sleep.

00:31:43.173 --> 00:31:44.396
ALARM

00:32:06.731 --> 00:32:07.420
Van.

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:09.859
I need to go shower.

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:15.869
If the future hadn’t shown me,

00:34:17.259 --> 00:34:19.005
I’d never know that…

00:34:20.688 --> 00:34:22.339
you’re this cute.

00:34:30.833 --> 00:34:33.788
So what happens to you and me
ten years from now?

00:34:34.042 --> 00:34:35.053
Tell me already.

00:34:36.169 --> 00:34:37.118
We’re boyfriends.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.390
Gosh, I’m freaking sleepy.

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:55.208
Class hasn’t even started yet,
and you’re already sleepy?

00:34:55.578 --> 00:34:57.448
I just hate morning classes.

00:34:58.003 --> 00:34:58.592
Hey.

00:34:59.537 --> 00:35:00.415
You’re fully recovered?

00:35:00.964 --> 00:35:02.142
I’m better now.

00:35:02.635 --> 00:35:04.149
Hey, your cast is off.

00:35:04.416 --> 00:35:05.726
Does it mean you can go home?

00:35:16.407 --> 00:35:17.052
Farm.

00:35:17.812 --> 00:35:18.312
Yeah?

00:35:18.887 --> 00:35:20.431
Will you go to the bathroom with me?

00:35:26.696 --> 00:35:27.938
I’m coming too.

00:35:27.938 --> 00:35:28.438
Hey,

00:35:28.952 --> 00:35:31.190
if we don’t get back
before roll call, cover for us.

00:35:33.244 --> 00:35:34.780
Yeah, sure.

00:35:37.368 --> 00:35:38.514
Hey, Jinn.

00:35:39.212 --> 00:35:40.600
Will you come sit next to me?

00:35:42.284 --> 00:35:43.659
I’m literally right in front of you.

00:35:43.659 --> 00:35:44.775
Why would I move next to you?

00:35:46.418 --> 00:35:48.816
I just want someone beside me.

00:35:48.816 --> 00:35:49.819
Oh, yeah?

00:35:49.819 --> 00:35:51.513
Someone beside you?

00:35:52.684 --> 00:35:53.709
Go sit with your dad.

00:36:00.959 --> 00:36:01.670
What’s wrong?

00:36:08.049 --> 00:36:09.050
It’s still going on.

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:18.943
I’m off.

00:36:19.087 --> 00:36:20.322
Right. See you later.

00:36:26.416 --> 00:36:30.250
You two took the entire class period
just to use the bathroom.

00:36:30.524 --> 00:36:32.902
Next time, if you want to skip, invite me too.

00:36:33.025 --> 00:36:33.935
I’m lonely.

00:36:35.126 --> 00:36:35.826
Here.

00:36:37.901 --> 00:36:40.607
Yeah, we just got carried away talking.

00:36:42.168 --> 00:36:43.512
Where’s Jinn?

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:44.922
He left.

00:36:45.415 --> 00:36:46.666
What? What about me?

00:36:46.666 --> 00:36:47.412
He said you were not leaving together.

00:36:47.412 --> 00:36:48.998
My ass!

00:36:48.998 --> 00:36:50.453
He just walked off. If you—

00:36:54.284 --> 00:36:54.979
Great.

00:37:01.634 --> 00:37:02.901
Let’s grab something to eat

00:37:03.866 --> 00:37:05.625
so you’ll stop complaining.

00:37:06.284 --> 00:37:08.364
Fine. Whatever.

00:37:09.062 --> 00:37:10.351
Anyone can just leave me behind.

00:37:11.891 --> 00:37:13.090
Except you.

00:37:16.007 --> 00:37:17.093
You, shut up.

00:37:17.504 --> 00:37:19.095
And walk.

00:37:23.059 --> 00:37:24.565
Jinn, open the door now.

00:37:24.804 --> 00:37:25.918
Jinn, open the door.

00:37:30.745 --> 00:37:32.079
Isn’t your hand already healed?

00:37:32.675 --> 00:37:34.903
There’s no reason for me
to be your chauffeur.

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:35.782
Jinn.

00:37:38.452 --> 00:37:39.529
Bye-bye.

00:37:46.582 --> 00:37:47.456
Don’t.

00:37:48.113 --> 00:37:49.048
Go to work already.

00:37:50.958 --> 00:37:52.145
Fine, I’m going.

00:37:52.484 --> 00:37:53.183
Bye-bye.

00:37:59.655 --> 00:38:00.461
J!

00:38:00.749 --> 00:38:01.426
I’m off now.

00:38:29.172 --> 00:38:30.928
AUNTIE JENNY

00:38:34.051 --> 00:38:35.054
Hello, Auntie Jen.

00:38:35.958 --> 00:38:38.654
I got home and found
that J and his car were gone.

00:38:38.818 --> 00:38:40.437
And I can’t reach him.

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:42.364
(Is he with you, Jinn?)

00:38:43.494 --> 00:38:44.451
He’s not.

00:38:49.866 --> 00:38:50.585
Damn it, J.

00:38:50.585 --> 00:38:51.357
What the hell are you playing now?

00:38:55.235 --> 00:38:56.099
TAR

00:38:56.633 --> 00:38:57.462
Hello, Tar.

00:38:59.023 --> 00:39:00.098
Yes. Sure.

00:39:03.918 --> 00:39:07.099
When was the first time
you saw those visions?

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:10.676
I’d been seeing them vaguely
in my dreams for a while.

00:39:12.284 --> 00:39:14.262
But I saw them clearly for the first time…

00:39:15.536 --> 00:39:17.259
when I crashed the car.

00:39:18.656 --> 00:39:22.046
Are you saying you lost control
of the car because of this?

00:39:23.648 --> 00:39:24.788
I can’t explain it.

00:39:26.534 --> 00:39:31.671
It felt like I was pulled into it,
and I forgot I was even driving.

00:39:32.308 --> 00:39:33.636
The next thing I knew,

00:39:34.499 --> 00:39:36.008
the car had already crashed.

00:39:38.863 --> 00:39:42.134
But you usually only see
these visions when you’re asleep.

00:39:43.284 --> 00:39:45.776
So, at the circuit…

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:51.002
That was the first time you saw
something while you were awake.

00:39:54.284 --> 00:39:55.730
I’ve never thought about that.

00:40:05.561 --> 00:40:08.140
You say you hate him the most,
yet you’re the first to come, Jinn.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.800
How could you let him drive?

00:40:12.848 --> 00:40:14.374
His hand isn’t even fully healed.

00:40:14.949 --> 00:40:17.109
My guy called, saying
someone trespassed on my circuit.

00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:19.115
When I got here,
he was already losing it like this.

00:40:22.287 --> 00:40:23.144
Where are you going, Jinn?

00:40:24.417 --> 00:40:25.393
To stop him.

00:40:59.168 --> 00:40:59.880
J!

00:41:00.702 --> 00:41:01.572
Asshole!

00:41:03.004 --> 00:41:03.685
Jinn?

00:41:14.079 --> 00:41:16.145
You bastard. Get out of the car.

00:41:16.145 --> 00:41:17.090
Hey, asshole.

00:41:17.275 --> 00:41:18.372
I said get out of the car.

00:41:18.639 --> 00:41:20.691
Open the door, asshole!

00:41:23.484 --> 00:41:24.409
What the f*ck is wrong with you?

00:41:24.409 --> 00:41:25.907
Tell me. What the f*ck is going on with you?

00:41:25.907 --> 00:41:27.051
I don’t want to be like this anymore!

00:41:33.224 --> 00:41:34.790
I don’t want to be like this anymore.

00:41:35.283 --> 00:41:36.782
I don’t want to be like this anymore.

00:41:45.163 --> 00:41:47.317
I don’t want to be like this anymore, Jinn.

00:41:50.008 --> 00:41:52.341
I want it to stop. I don’t want to be like this.

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:55.917
I don’t want to be like this anymore, Jinn.

00:41:57.067 --> 00:41:58.637
I don’t want to be like this anymore.

00:42:00.116 --> 00:42:01.945
I’m done. I don’t want it.

00:42:06.423 --> 00:42:07.718
It’s okay, J.

00:42:08.124 --> 00:42:09.750
I really don’t want to be like this anymore.

00:42:12.777 --> 00:42:13.691
It’s alright.

00:42:30.197 --> 00:42:33.391
So when I see you having nightmares
and waking up at night all the time,

00:42:35.774 --> 00:42:37.293
you’re actually…

00:42:49.545 --> 00:42:51.119
I know it’s hard to believe.

00:42:52.351 --> 00:42:53.598
But I’ve proved everything.

00:42:55.857 --> 00:42:56.727
Proved how?

00:42:58.884 --> 00:43:02.454
I know exactly how you take your coffee,
down to every spoon.

00:43:03.768 --> 00:43:08.247
I know you love strawberry ice cream
even though you try so hard to hide it.

00:43:10.322 --> 00:43:15.258
I knew your notebook was in
your underwear drawer because…

00:43:15.874 --> 00:43:16.871
I dreamed about it.

00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:26.929
So, that means…

00:43:28.614 --> 00:43:30.647
yesterday, you knew I was going to
get hit by that bike?

00:43:32.783 --> 00:43:36.656
Normally, the visions I see
are way in the future.

00:43:37.785 --> 00:43:39.320
It’s rare to see something this near.

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:49.273
Is this why you seem more mature?

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:52.719
You think so?

00:43:54.095 --> 00:43:54.815
Why?

00:43:57.218 --> 00:43:59.385
There are moments
when you’re steadier than me,

00:43:59.878 --> 00:44:01.027
calmer than me.

00:44:02.834 --> 00:44:04.590
Sometimes you just ignore me
when I try to pick a fight.

00:44:06.398 --> 00:44:08.870
If it were before, we’d be
beating each other up already.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.272
There’s no way we could’ve lived together.

00:44:14.538 --> 00:44:15.727
I didn’t realize that.

00:44:16.754 --> 00:44:17.918
How could you?

00:44:18.781 --> 00:44:22.809
You then and you now are still you.

00:44:27.697 --> 00:44:31.776
So what other visions
do you see far in the future?

00:44:40.118 --> 00:44:41.146
I see…

00:44:43.035 --> 00:44:46.967
our future, ten years from now.

00:44:49.689 --> 00:44:50.432
Our?

00:44:52.589 --> 00:44:58.197
When I said that the notebook helped me
realize my feelings, I wasn’t joking.

00:44:58.978 --> 00:45:00.743
In my dreams, I see myself,

00:45:01.133 --> 00:45:02.726
so I understand how I feel.

00:45:04.308 --> 00:45:08.443
But when I read your feelings
from the notebook, I realized…

00:45:10.579 --> 00:45:12.086
how much I’d been overlooking.

00:45:16.214 --> 00:45:18.910
So what happens to you and me
ten years from now?

00:45:20.471 --> 00:45:21.573
Tell me already.

00:45:25.085 --> 00:45:25.977
We’re boyfriends.

00:45:26.573 --> 00:45:27.178
Huh?

00:45:33.572 --> 00:45:34.594
We hug.

00:46:09.809 --> 00:46:10.632
We kiss.

00:46:13.425 --> 00:46:14.576
You and I love each other.

00:46:15.274 --> 00:46:16.019
J.

00:46:16.019 --> 00:46:17.457
We do love each other.

00:46:31.629 --> 00:46:33.307
So, what do we do now?

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:34.806
What the heck are we waiting for?

00:46:35.073 --> 00:46:35.997
We’re boyfriends, of course.

00:46:37.394 --> 00:46:38.521
I can’t sleep.

00:46:38.644 --> 00:46:40.548
I want to cuddle my boyfriend.

00:46:41.061 --> 00:46:42.742
I’m gonna put this on the table, Mom.

00:46:42.742 --> 00:46:43.258
Sure.

00:46:46.688 --> 00:46:48.151
How long are you going to keep doing this?

00:46:48.284 --> 00:46:51.387
Until someone comes along to
take care of you in my place, I guess.

00:46:52.126 --> 00:46:53.710
Don’t you want to take care of me forever?

00:46:54.696 --> 00:46:58.497
What if everything that’s happened
is just a coincidence?

00:46:58.579 --> 00:47:03.284
Well, at least my feelings turned out real.
