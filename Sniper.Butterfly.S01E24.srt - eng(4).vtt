00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:04.840
Sorry.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.790
The number you dialed

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.020

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.570
Here, let's dry your hair.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.180
I'll do it later.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.780
Don't catch a cold.

00:03:55.977 --> 00:03:56.955
I'll help you dry it.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.911
Then I'll be counting on you.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.220
Here.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.460
Sorry.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.580
It's okay.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.220
Actually,

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.050
I have something to tell you.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.900
That...

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.340
That matter before

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.020
was my fault.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.220
Sorry.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.780
You have the right to like anyone.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.780
I...

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.220
should not have used my health
to manipulate you.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.140
Nor...

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.530
should I selfishly keep you.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.340
So, from now on,

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:57.730
I won't...

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.780
Li Wu.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.490
Let's be together again.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.730
What...

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.580
What do you mean?

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.370
What I'm about to say

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.100
might be a bit selfish.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.720
I originally thought

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.700
I had made up my mind.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.580
No matter what happens,

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.220
I wouldn't look back.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.850
But after spending this time together,

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.340
I realized

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.170
I can't ignore your presence.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.410
I can't move forward on my own,

00:06:49.155 --> 00:06:50.622
and I don't want to lie to myself.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.340
Li Wu.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.580
I like you.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.020
Do you still want to be with me?

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:15.370
You...

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.460
What kind of expression is that?

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:20.140
I...

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.490
I don't know either.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.780
It's just

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.530
very complicated.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.340
I am very happy,

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.970
but also very distressed.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.020
Why are you distressed?

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:46.900
Because

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.930
I just can't figure it out.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:53.660
Why...

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.290
I feel like...

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.170
I have no boundaries at all.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.340
It seems as long as you beckon,

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.730
I'll come back again.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.977
Then, blame me for not beckoning sooner.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.780
Did you just say

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.220
you want to give up?

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.270
Actually, what I just said

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.010
is not finished.

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:44.850
What I want to say is

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.010
if you choose someone else...

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.180
I won't disturb you.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:05.730
But,

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.130
in this lifetime,

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.080
until I die,

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.250
I will only like you.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.910
This lifetime, only you.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:14.790
I won't marry.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.060
I won't have a girlfriend.

00:09:16.866 --> 00:09:18.490
But I will definitely not disturb you.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.460
You're in a good state today.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.340
If I remember correctly,

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.100
this is your best performance.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:08.030
Maybe today

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:09.370
I'm really in top form.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.510
When did you arrive?

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:15.666
Why didn't you call me?

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.150
I saw you were focused,

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.490
afraid to disrupt your rhythm.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:20.850
Here.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:21.820
Thanks.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.480
I see your technique

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.490
has improved again today.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.700
No.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.250
Just lucky today.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:29.150
I still have a few more.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:29.700
Really?

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:30.840
Alright.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.060
Then, after you're done,

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.040
we'll go together.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.880
- I'll drive you then.
- Okay.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.610
No problem.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.250
I just observed.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.250
Your archery style today

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.700
is a bit different from usual.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:46.370
Really?

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.890
Today, your archery

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.010
is obviously faster than usual.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:57.610
You mean

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.490
that I previously

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.370
spent too much time aiming?

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.060
Seems like it.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:12.770
So...

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.130
shouldn't I be like this?

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.490
Do you remember why

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.490
I started learning archery?

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:25.770
I remember.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.100
You said

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.300
it was to find a sense of order.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.100
When shooting arrows,

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.340
my eyes only see the target.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.610
My mind only thinks about

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.850
how to perform the movements correctly.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.540
Things I can hold in my hands

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.130
give me a sense of security,

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:47.850
and a clear goal.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.220
But recently,

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.060
I've had a new realization.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:54.970
What is it?

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.700
Just like your archery just now.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.250
You didn't spend much time thinking

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:05.540
about how to do it,

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:07.490
yet you shot better.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.130
I seem to realize

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.790
that I, too, shoot more steadily
without much preparation.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:15.820
The arrow flies smoothly.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:19.770
Strangely enough,

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.460
I originally wanted
to let go of thoughts,

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:25.540
but then realized

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.100
only by following my heart,

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.300
can I find the right direction,

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.010
and master archery properly.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.420
It's quite strange.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.060
Sometimes it's like...

00:13:49.711 --> 00:13:50.300
Already arrived.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.650
You intended to go east,

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:56.820
but were told

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.130
your target is in the west.

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.420
When you set your mind on the west,

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:04.580
you find nothing there.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.220
Yet the one heading east

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.220
gains something.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:12.820
Too bad.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.850
I realized it a bit late.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.010
Actually, I came today

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.730
to say a few things to you.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.080
Between us...

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.850
My annual pass is almost expired.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.420
I've realized

00:14:31.622 --> 00:14:33.533
I won't have a place to shoot anymore.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.340
I'm leaving here soon.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:43.300
Where to?

00:14:45.555 --> 00:14:48.088
The hospital assigned me
to Xiehe for further training.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:49.420
I've already signed.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.770
That should be a good opportunity.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.150
This time,

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:58.730
I'll have more clinical exposure,

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.120
which also fits

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.490
my original career plan.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.420
Congratulations.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:09.370
Then,

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:10.940
we'll still be friends?

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.610
Of course.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.420
Wish you a smooth promotion.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:16.770
Thanks.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:22.240
Mr. Shen.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.240
This is our

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.750
overall advertising creative plan.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:25.270
After people

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:26.300
from Tongchen come over...

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.610
Jun, it's this, right?

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:30.130
Yes, exactly.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.300
Hello, everyone, long time no see.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.820

Mr. Li.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.340
Didn't expect you'd come together too.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.420
We've been waiting for you.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.300
Because I didn't know

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.840
Mr. Li would come.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.300
So I asked for one less drink.

00:15:47.422 --> 00:15:48.850
Can you tell the front desk for me?

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:49.970
Okay, I'll go.

00:15:50.133 --> 00:15:52.066
You're not letting Ms. Cen
purposely avoid me

00:15:52.066 --> 00:15:53.650
just because I came, right?

00:15:54.333 --> 00:15:56.180
Is there some misunderstanding
between us?

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.370
Not at all.

00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:59.030
It's really

00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.970
my personal oversight.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.770
That's good.

00:16:01.266 --> 00:16:02.480
No need to trouble Ms. Chen

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.420
just for the coffee.

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:05.100
I'll go get it.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:11.370
Then, let's start.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:12.080
Okay.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:12.480
Alright.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.130
Everyone's familiar now. Sit wherever.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.770
Here, Jin.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:22.870
Alright.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:23.370
Thank you.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:25.650
Lu Tong.

00:16:25.866 --> 00:16:27.720
I've made some adjustments
to today's documents.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.850
I sent you the new version.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:29.940
Okay, thanks, Mr. Cheng.

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:36.420
Wait a moment.

00:16:44.666 --> 00:16:46.010
I've sent it over. Take a look.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:47.650
Got it.

00:16:54.666 --> 00:16:56.870
Mr. Shen, take a look.
The latest advertising creative plan.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:57.730
(Don't mess around.)

00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:58.460
(Let go.)

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.300
Mr. Li, Mr. Cheng.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.200
We should

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.420
have gone to your company,

00:17:03.422 --> 00:17:05.540
but it ended up making both of you
come all the way here.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.440
It's nothing.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.466
It's the same either way.

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:10.580
We also happened to be passing by today.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.510
Then I'll start.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:14.020
Okay.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:15.400
First,

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.240
thank you all

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.580
for your previous marketing work.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.830
Tongchen has gradually received

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:20.660
many high-quality clients'
cooperation intentions.

00:17:20.666 --> 00:17:21.600
Conversion is good.

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:22.640
Currently,

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.640
our next financing

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.580
is in progress.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.680
Technology upgrades

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.020
are also steadily advancing.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.750
I see parking spots at the entrance.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:32.890
Why park so far?

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.400
After eating,

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.820
take a walk to digest.

00:17:36.844 --> 00:17:38.060
- True.
- Introduce these dishes

00:17:38.066 --> 00:17:38.910
to the clients.

00:17:39.266 --> 00:17:39.790
Excuse me.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:40.500
Welcome.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.020
Wait.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.100
This handsome guy.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.170
Have we met before?

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.890
I remember.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.200
A few years ago,

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.780
you often came here to eat.

00:17:54.244 --> 00:17:55.370
I heard from your sister

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.170
that you went to Africa
for a study tour.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.210
Why aren't you darker?

00:18:00.377 --> 00:18:01.500
He's back from the study tour.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:02.720
Yes.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.370
Please, come in.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.300
Study tour in Africa?

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.020
Supporting African tourism development.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:17.340
Alright.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.580
If needed.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.720
Today, to celebrate

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.110
your return from the study tour,

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:24.422
you can order whatever you like.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:25.370
Okay.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.980
One Crispy Sweet and Sour Pork.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.410
Pork stew.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:32.820
And some barbecue.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.410
Order it.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:36.540
Done.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:54.890
Enjoy.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.980
Thanks.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.060
Here.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.850
Beer's mine, and coconut juice is yours.

00:19:17.111 --> 00:19:18.310
You can't drink alcohol.

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:19.533
But I can have coconut juice.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.930
Nothing happened
the day before yesterday

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.610
when Mr. Shen sent you home?

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:52.690
What are you thinking?

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.350
Nothing happened.

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:55.500
Really?

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:57.750
The night before last, after you left,

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:58.930
I heard gossip from Xiao Jun.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:00.750
He said Mr. Shen

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:01.850
had a girlfriend before,

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.500
but it didn't work out in the end.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.580
After that,
he couldn't forget his old love,

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:08.930
and he never
got close to any other girl.

00:20:10.066 --> 00:20:11.844
Recently, seeing you two
being so clingy.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.850
Xiao Jun said

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:15.020
he must have figured it out.

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:16.740
And also,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:18.890
I think

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.300
Mr. Shen really cares about you.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:25.170
Couldn't forget his old love?

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:29.850
Shen Yiyang.

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:33.060
We've been quite clingy lately.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.540
But does it have to mean anything?

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:37.690
You know me.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.070
I'm not the kind of person

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:41.580
who locks themselves in a relationship

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.210
and sticks to one tree.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:44.740
I didn't think so before.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:47.100
But recently, seeing you

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:48.580
so determined,

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.000
I thought you were ready

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.610
to commit.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.260
Commit? Commit to what?

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.820
No way.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.780
In love,

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:00.070
isn't the ambiguous and teasing phase

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.890
most fun?

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.610
It wouldn't be fun
if we were really together.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:06.740
Alright.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.410
Just don't lie to yourself.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:23.980
(Shen Yiyang)

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.900
(Shen Yiyang)

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.377
(I accidentally hit your number.)

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:39.030
Morning, Jin.

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:39.580
Morning.

00:21:42.733 --> 00:21:43.400
Morning, Jin.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:43.890
Morning.

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:46.510
Morning, Jin.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:47.890
Looking cheerful.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.000
Maybe because the weather is nice,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:50.890
then, the mood's good.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.820
Wait a minute.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:52.980
What?

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:55.740
I think it's because

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.740
your mood is good,

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:58.680
so you feel

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.100
that any weather is nice.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.400
This is a

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.850
couple's keychain.

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:07.020
Just changed it last night?

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:08.260
With who?

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:10.160
No one.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:10.790
No one?

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:11.820
Don't lie to me.

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:13.820
This is a popular brand.

00:22:13.866 --> 00:22:15.820
There's no way I wouldn't know them.

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:16.550
Back then,

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:17.480
for this plan,

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:17.960
I revised it

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:18.890
countless times.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:20.590
So now when I see it,

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:21.980
I get triggered.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:22.610
With who?

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.200
I'll leave first.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.511
So it doesn't bother your eyes.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.820
I'll interrogate you later.

00:22:30.022 --> 00:22:31.610
Yi said he'll be a few minutes late.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.270
So later,

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:34.070
we'll wait for him
at the entrance of Yuanshi.

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.580
Okay.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.750
(When did you)

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:47.890
(change my keychain?)

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.370
(Last night.)

00:22:53.577 --> 00:22:55.333
(While you weren't paying attention.)

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.100
(Isn't it a bit childish?)

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.610
(Isn't it nice?)

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:08.000
(We seem closer)

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.450
(after using couple style.)

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.690
(But if you don't like this one,)

00:23:11.888 --> 00:23:13.260
(we can pick a new one together)

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.450
(on the weekend.)

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:21.850
(You go ahead and present.)

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.488
(Waiting for your good news.)

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.130
You...

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.070
I was wondering

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:31.533
why you were smiling so happily.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.020
Jin. I've been knocking for a while.

00:23:58.088 --> 00:23:59.000
There's something urgent

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.020
I need you to confirm.

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:00.750
Sorry.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:01.888
I didn't hear that just now.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:02.540
Come in.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:10.020
Help me check this document.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:10.740
Okay.

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:15.580
Hello.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:16.880
Our king crabs

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.100
are all fresh.

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:20.260
You can have the king crab three ways.

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.610
The crab legs can be done
Typhoon Shelter style.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.577
The crab body can be steamed,

00:24:24.644 --> 00:24:26.350
and be made with salt and pepper.

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:27.130
Just a moment.

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:36.260
Shen Yiyang.

00:24:37.288 --> 00:24:38.790
What have you been up to
recently?

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:40.022
Why haven't you contacted me?

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:42.210
A bit busy.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.020
No time.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.210
Did I upset you?

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:49.300
Why are you ignoring me?

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:50.930
Not at all.

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:53.820
Your meal is packed.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.060
Thanks.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.020
Alright.

00:24:59.488 --> 00:25:01.020
I have something to do. I'll go first.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.130
Are you serious, Shen Yiyang?

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.440
I'm not clinging to you

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.780
or making you responsible for me.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.170
Why are you being so awkward
and avoiding me?

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:12.890
Or is it you feel
you're at a disadvantage?

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:14.170
Want me to apologize?

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.020
Tell me then.

00:25:19.177 --> 00:25:20.300
Did I say something wrong?

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:22.000
We're all adults.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.060
Isn't this kind of thing quite common?

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:29.690
For you,

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:31.340
it's normal?

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:35.060
Otherwise?

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.890
Speak clearly!

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:46.540
Shen Yiyang!

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.650
Morning.

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:01.780
Up already?

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:05.000
Go wash up.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.222
Breakfast will be ready soon.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.450
Why are you wearing my clothes?

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.740
Just grabbed it.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.210
Don't like it?

00:26:27.555 --> 00:26:29.000
I haven't brushed my teeth yet.

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:45.890
A new twist again.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:49.890
Eat.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.688
I'll be on a business trip
in a couple of days, attending a summit.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.240
I've prepared all the backup dishes.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.300
They're all in the fridge.

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:57.780
But there are still a few days left.

00:26:58.711 --> 00:26:59.690
You're so thoughtful,

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:01.210
even prepared my rations.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.300
Leave them to eat slowly.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.820
Try today's first.

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:12.740
So delicious.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.410
Chef-level.

00:27:31.088 --> 00:27:31.880
My coffee is ready.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.600
Forgot to grab it.
Can you get it for me?

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.410
What's this?

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:50.690
A gift.

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:55.170
Why give me a gift for no reason?

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.650
Today is...

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:03.500
our one-month anniversary together.

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:07.370
No need to make a big deal
out of one month.

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.340
I thought you'd like it a lot.

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:14.580
I like it! Of course I do!

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.890
I just

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:20.030
think you don't need to constantly

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:21.580
try to surprise me.

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:23.410
These are like

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:24.890
hidden surprises.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:26.480
I'm happy when there are some,

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.400
and when there aren't,
I won't ask for them.

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:31.240
Besides,

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.100
I already have this big gift.

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:41.210
Eat up.

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.850
Okay.

00:28:55.222 --> 00:28:56.350
I didn't bring my phone.

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:57.170
Can I borrow yours?

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.690
So good.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.130
Oh no, it must be my mom.

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:32.100
Quick.

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:38.690
Hide.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:45.450
You're up.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.170
I thought you'd sleep in.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:47.830
Mom,

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:49.270
aren't you going to dance today?

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:50.340
Why are you here now?

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.820
I went to the supermarket
with Mrs. Chen,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.270
and bought some spare ribs.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.044
I'm going to make you some
spare rib soup.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:29:58.980
You left

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:02.680
this at home last time.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.880
I've tidied it up for you.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:04.850
I'll put it in your room.

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:06.410
Mom.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.110
I can put it myself.

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:10.844
Your hands are wet,
so you can't handle it.

00:30:10.866 --> 00:30:11.488
I'll do it.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.060
Mom.

00:30:13.177 --> 00:30:14.830
My room's too messy.
I can put it myself.

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:15.680
You're my daughter.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.444
I can definitely tell
if your room is messy.

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:18.850
Mom.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.650
Mom.

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:32.030
You really said it yourself.

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:32.640
So messy.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.650
The blanket isn't folded.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:34.850
The bed isn't made.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.610
Mom, let me do it.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:39.777
I'll tidy it myself.

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:41.100
Okay, you do it.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.210
Alright, got it.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:51.610
Where's he?

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.820
Where's he?

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:12.300
It's weird.

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:14.170
Where did he go?

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:55.850
Jin.

00:31:56.533 --> 00:31:57.750
I'm making you spare rib soup.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:58.780
I need a clay pot.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.210
Stop messing around.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.830
Where's that

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:04.340
red clay pot of yours?

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:08.060
Did you hear me? Clay pot.

00:32:09.488 --> 00:32:10.450
Don't make a sound.

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:12.740
Did you hear me?

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:15.610
What's wrong?

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:16.980
Your face is so red.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.060
Is it?

00:32:20.222 --> 00:32:21.920
Mom, you're looking
for the clay pot, right?

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.070
Yeah, that red one.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:23.680
Where is it?

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.170
It's in the cabinet.

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:26.260
Why didn't I find it?

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:15.410
Look at you.

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.210
The air conditioner is so cold,

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:19.180
and you're wearing just one shirt.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.500
Aren't your legs cold?

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.580
It's so hot.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.370
You should button this button.

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.260
Where's the button?

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:32.060
Take it off. I'll sew it for you.

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:34.370
No need, Mom.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:36.980
After the soup's ready,

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:38.450
you can drink a bowl.

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.370
Or use it as broth for noodles.

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:41.240
Don't forget

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.450
to cook the yams a bit more.

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:43.780
Thanks, Mom.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:45.920
Mom.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.850
I'm going to meet a colleague later.

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:49.890
You can go back first.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.650
Don't delay your dance, Mom.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.270
You meet your colleague.

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:56.110
I'll stay here.

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:57.210
It won't bother you.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:33:59.920
I got confused.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.370
The colleague is coming home.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.130
We need to discuss work.

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:04.110
Coming home

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:05.060
is even better.

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:06.370
I'm in your room.

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:07.780
I won't bother you.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.610
Mom.

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.500
Jin.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:14.550
I kindly

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:15.900
made pork rib soup for you,

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.290
but you disliked it.

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:19.320
Okay.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.540
I'll wash my hands and leave.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.170
I didn't mean anything.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:25.770
Where's the hand soap?

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:27.650
Bathroom.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:32.580
Mom.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.420
Dislike me?

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:40.244
I'll wash my hands first.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:56.610
Such a mess.

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:05.340
(Hydrating Vitality Cleanser)

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:06.330
For men?

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:27.690
Jin.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.550
Have you met

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:31.420
Dr. Lu recently?

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.770
How many times?

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:35.230
I've been busy.

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:36.244
We haven't met much.

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.610
Mom.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.250
Did you add salt

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.170
to this soup?

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.460
What if I don't believe it?

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:46.940
Why would I lie to you?

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:49.420
I was just about to ask you.

00:35:49.444 --> 00:35:50.670
You're having breakfast alone.

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:51.844
Why bother with two plates

00:35:51.844 --> 00:35:53.355
and two pairs of chopsticks?

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.130
I've been eating more lately.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.250
Just now, you said

00:36:03.266 --> 00:36:04.066
you have a colleague

00:36:04.066 --> 00:36:05.333
coming over to talk about work.

00:36:05.355 --> 00:36:06.111
Which colleague?

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:06.900
Do I know him?

00:36:07.755 --> 00:36:09.030
Just an ordinary colleague.

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:10.100
How would you know him?

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:12.650
Ordinary colleague.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.130
Ordinary colleague.

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:18.460
Alright.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:19.770
I'll leave now.

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:21.810
I won't get in your way.

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:24.210
Well...

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.580
Just have a proper talk

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.540
with your ordinary colleague.

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:31.380
I'm leaving.

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:35.670
Mom, bye.

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:36.420
Bye.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.900
That scared me.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.610
My mom's gone. You can come out now.

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:12.100
Have you had enough corn?

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:33.770
Sorry.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.940
I got a bit anxious earlier,

00:37:37.777 --> 00:37:39.060
afraid my mom would find out.

00:37:42.533 --> 00:37:44.200
What would happen if she found out?

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.590
Actually, I don't know either

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:49.330
what would happen.

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:52.380
But now definitely isn't the right time.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.420
Why?

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:55.320
First,

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.360
over the years, my mom

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.940
has almost treated you like her own son.

00:37:59.022 --> 00:38:00.690
She's always thought we were siblings.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:02.610
Suddenly telling her

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.100
that we're together,

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.210
she definitely wouldn't accept it.

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.650
Moreover,

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:09.150
my mom wants me to find

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:10.440
someone mature and steady,

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.020
like...

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.550
Anyway, definitely not

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:19.060
someone much younger like you.

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:26.420
Alright then.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:29.810
Sorry.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.280
Hiding and sneaking around

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.130
must feel awful.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:40.980
Actually...

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:44.250
It's not bad.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.244
It was pretty thrilling earlier.

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:51.888
Just kidding.

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:55.290
I trust you.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.210
I also trust myself.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:38:59.860
You told me before

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.030
that a relationship
not known to everyone

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:03.170
can last till the end.

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:05.250
We can take it slow.

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:08.210
Sounds so sweet.

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:10.150
All your ant-like moving acts

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:11.400
have already troubled me enough.

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.280
I even suspect my mom
has noticed something's off.

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.460
Hurry up and pack your stuff.

00:39:16.577 --> 00:39:18.622
I'll pack it up when I get back
from the business trip.

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:25.100
I'll pack now.

00:39:27.844 --> 00:39:28.955
Where are you going?

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.060
To change clothes.

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.690
I don't even know who did this.

00:39:40.355 --> 00:39:41.540
Hurry and pack your things.

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:56.880
Finally, you have some time,

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.980
and are willing to put Li Wu aside
to come see me.

00:39:59.333 --> 00:40:00.644
He went on a business trip.

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.650
You've completely lost me.

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:05.130
But as soon as he left,

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.190
I rushed

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:06.980
to come see you.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.290
Not a second wasted.

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:10.980
You're putting love over friendship.

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:12.540
Yang.

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.650
Alright.

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:18.610
Looking at your face,

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.730
you do look much healthier.

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:24.250
I feel I might be getting older.

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.590
I feel

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:26.840
a bit powerless.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:27.860
What do you mean?

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.190
Right now,

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:31.130
I no longer

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.100
have any expectations

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:34.770
for romance or surprises.

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:38.210
Breakfast never repeats.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.630
Celebrating a monthly anniversary.

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:41.755
Of course, they are nice.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:43.900
But how should I describe it?

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.690
Just...

00:40:45.377 --> 00:40:47.290
If you don't expect,
you won't be disappointed.

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:49.550
I also can't guarantee

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:51.110
that our relationship

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:52.488
will always stay this passionate.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:54.900
I feel that,

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.840
a calm, ordinary relationship

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:57.810
suits me better.

00:40:58.177 --> 00:40:59.244
You know what I mean.

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:00.540
I don't.

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.590
I feel that you're

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:04.610
taking advantage and still acting cute.

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.380
Thanks.

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:17.630
Why does my phone randomly

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:18.860
have a new app?

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.440
Exclusive Puppy.

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.250
What's this?

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:23.420
Let's open it.

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:26.650
Hello, Master.

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:29.250
I am your exclusive puppy.

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:32.580
From now on, every day,

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.900
I will find little surprises
in your life.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.250
What is this?

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:42.730
Li Wu used my phone this morning.

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:44.610
He must have installed it then.

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:48.840
People with skills are just different.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.980
So this is another way to have fun
while dating.

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.770
A surprise?

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.650
I wonder what it is.

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.860
Could it be that he's waiting
for me at home?

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:01.940
Be rational.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.670
Didn't you just say

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:04.980
he went on a business trip?

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.900
Yes.

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.330
This lady is crazy.

00:42:10.422 --> 00:42:11.810
Alright, I'll drink with you.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:13.290
