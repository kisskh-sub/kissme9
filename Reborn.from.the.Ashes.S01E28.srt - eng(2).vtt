[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.440
[Episode 28]

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.040
Wanyan Lie,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.230
you have betrayed your true self,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.660
shown disloyalty to your ruler,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.090
and brought shame upon the people.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.670
Back then,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.960
my father refused
to stoop to your level,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.440
and you accused him
of poisoning the entire army.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.270
You deserve to die.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.960
He deserved it.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.520
Anyone who disobeys me

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.630
must be eliminated.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.550
Wanyan Lie,

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.360
you face death yet refuse to repent.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.920
Wanyan Jin,

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.150
I am your own father.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.000
I appointed you crown prince,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.590
but you would try to kill me.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.920
You truly are

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.110
a traitorous, ungrateful son.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.630
Traitorous son?

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.710
You must have forgotten.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.630
Your son died in the battle

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.670
where the Qilin Army was wiped out.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.400
Father!

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.800
This...

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:56.550
You...

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.590
You actually are...

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.230
Tomorrow is the day of your beheading.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.550
Are you satisfied

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.320
with this outcome?

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.710
It turns out

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.710
you are...

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.580
Where did this blind fool come from?

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.400
Get lost quickly.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.070
Su Feiyi.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:57.520
Qi.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.590
Is that you?

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.070
You have left me in such a state.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.840
I will kill you.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.710
Young Master Qi.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.150
Take a look.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.620
This man is a corrupt official

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.110
who embezzled military funds,

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.320
and harmed people everywhere,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.590
Wanyan Lie.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.800
He defies the law,

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.100
withholds the people's resources,

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.990
and utterly abuses his position
as an official.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.270
I, Wen Yueqian, have a grievance.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.400
My father, Wen Muchen,
Governor of Yunzhou City,

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.360
has always been loyal to His Majesty.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.040
I hope you will see the truth.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.990
He is a scoundrel from Yunzhou,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.160
not worth grieving over his death.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.880
Deserving of death, indeed.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.550
Smash him!

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:10.750
Smash him!

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.270
Smash him hard!

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.960
I'll smash you to death.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.590
Quiet.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.200
Though Wanyan Lie once
earned great honors in battle,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.300
and was conferred as a prince
of a different surname,

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.550
during his reign,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.470
he embezzled military funds
for personal gain,

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.270
and sheltered former Governor Su Guang
in trafficking arms

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.440
and selling intelligence.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.750
This is an act of disloyalty.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.480
He poisoned lives,

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.750
wronged the people,

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.290
colluded with the governor,

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.630
harmed thousands of officers
in the Qilin Army,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.990
and framed Wen Muchen,
causing his wrongful death.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.320
This is an act of injustice.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.690
He has done all kinds of evil.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.310
The Emperor was enraged beyond measure,

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.360
and ordered his execution.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.920
Beheading!

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.070
Good. Kill him.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:27.630
Qian,

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.460
our great revenge
has finally been taken.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.360
Why did you suddenly think
of releasing a sky lantern?

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.320
I heard

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:51.750
when someone passes away,

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.710
they become a star in the sky.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.630
I believe my father

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.550
is watching over me from above.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.070
I have cleared his name.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.040
And I found someone
who truly cares for me.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.360
Qian,

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.190
how lucky I am to have met you.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.110
Before,

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.750
we both bore the weight of a blood feud.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.360
Now I only wish to live a simple life

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.470
with just two people in one home,
sharing three meals together.

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:45.590
Don't ever let me down.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:48.760
I won't ever let you down.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.880
Qian.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:16.750
Qian.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.880
Qian, don't go.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.360
I know you don't want to see me.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.150
I also know you hate me.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:30.550
I know I was wrong.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.320
Since you left,

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.440
not a single day has passed
without my regret,

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.320
nor have I ever stopped missing you.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.590
I promise to cherish you from now on.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.110
I truly love you.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:45.550
That word, love,

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.400
you don't deserve it yet.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.880
It's only natural you're angry with me.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.920
Before, I was lowly and insecure.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:54.590
I was just a coward.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.440
Qian,

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.320
please don't walk away.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:03.230
What exactly do you want?

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.110
I want to spend my remaining life

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.190
making amends to you.

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:08.520
And then?

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.840
So,

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.840
give me a little more of your blood.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.710
Just a tiny bit.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:17.070
Don't worry.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:18.800
Once I recover,

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.840
I'll serve you loyally
to atone for my sins.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.510
Do you

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.560
really want my blood?

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.350
I do.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.680
Kneel down.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.510
Do you want it or not?

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.350
If you want it, come
and take it yourself.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.470
Why hurt your own hand for someone

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.070
who is about to die?

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.840
Honey,

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:40.310
let's go back now.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.000
Don't leave.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.430
Wanyan Qi.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.470
Enjoy the feeling

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.430
of life slipping away bit by bit,

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.680
just like I once did.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.350
You can't just leave me behind.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.040
You are my wife.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.390
You belong to me.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.390
She doesn't belong to anyone.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.880
She belongs to herself.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.830
♪Across endless lifetimes,
our paths still go astray♪

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:19.470

[Clear Mountains and Flowing Waters]

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.190
Now that Wanyan Jin has
sacrificed family for justice,

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.010
he has been conferred the title
of Prince Zhan

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:57.550
and placed in charge of Yunzhou affairs.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.110
You, the honorable Princess Consort,

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.150
actually handle these tasks yourself.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.210
My father used to be a military doctor.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.860
He taught me to plant
and tend herbal medicine from childhood.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.040
I enjoy it too.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.600
Can you truly let go of it?

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.350
Let go of what?

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:18.230
Wanyan Jin is the son of the man
who killed your father.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.920
Can you truly be without barriers
in your heart?

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:25.640
There indeed used to be barriers.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:27.390
But not anymore.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.680
Jin is completely different
from his father.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.880
He's honest,

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:32.150
brave,

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.760
and fearless.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.230
He's a genuinely kind person,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.210
someone who stands for justice.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:39.860
He's not necessarily the way
you imagine.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.310
Yeah?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:44.640
It's nothing.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.680
Old fool.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:55.000
Yueqian.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.640
Cangning.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:58.110
I'm telling you,

00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:58.960
my brother...

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:00.230
What about him?

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:01.900
He still can't let you go.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.430
He's been thinking about you all along.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.350
Don't say nonsense.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:05.040
Anyway,

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.470
if he tries to sow discord
between you and Jin again,

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.390
just tell me.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.640
I'll deal with him for you.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:11.150
Alright.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.350
You and Jin are a perfect match,

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.390
both pure and kind-hearted.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.470
I will definitely find a way
to make sure you are doing well.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:23.440
Why are you following me?

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:26.000
Fine.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:27.800
So you're stalking me.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.680
I think it's you following me.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:35.720
No more trouble.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.510
I'm not causing any trouble.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:39.470
What?

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.110
Officials can set fires,

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.450
but common folk can't light lamps?

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:43.960
I won't let you make it.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:54.010
Yan Shaoxuan,

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.390

you are destined to lose.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.110
The world is not yet settled.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.270
Don't speak too soon.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:07.640
Open the door.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.230
