Another ugly truth that shocked us all...

00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:39.690
came to light.

00:00:41.926 --> 00:00:44.495
Cho Na Jeong, did you hear?

00:00:44.495 --> 00:00:45.696
Hear what?

00:00:46.264 --> 00:00:47.965
They say the police took away...

00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:49.800
Kim Jeong Sik and Mr. Kang.

00:00:50.635 --> 00:00:52.103
Why? What happened?

00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:56.707
Mr. Kang got into a car accident
while drunk.

00:00:57.008 --> 00:00:58.009
Hey, Cho Na Jeong.

00:00:58.542 --> 00:00:59.777
What do you think you're doing right now?

00:00:59.777 --> 00:01:01.078
Are you out of your mind?

00:01:01.078 --> 00:01:03.447
I should be asking you, Mr. Kim.

00:01:03.447 --> 00:01:04.548
What are you saying?

00:01:05.383 --> 00:01:07.752
A boss can't have a drink
with his employee?

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:09.320
We can't even share a taxi?

00:01:11.022 --> 00:01:11.889
Mr. Kang!

00:01:13.758 --> 00:01:17.028
The police pulled the dashcam footage
while investigating the accident,

00:01:17.595 --> 00:01:18.529
and on there,

00:01:20.932 --> 00:01:22.333
they found the two of them...

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.835
sexually assaulting Seon Min.

00:01:37.481 --> 00:01:40.952
While drinking together
with Kang Jong Ryeol,

00:01:42.253 --> 00:01:44.288
you got a call from the victim,

00:01:44.488 --> 00:01:46.357
then you told her to come out for a drink,

00:01:49.026 --> 00:01:52.396
and when she got drunk,
you two put her in a car and...

00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:54.599
Goodness.

00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:59.036
You guys don't have a shred of conscience.

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.441
How could you do that...

00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:04.976
to someone who came to you
begging for help?

00:02:33.137 --> 00:02:34.138
Just a moment.

00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:37.341
- Nurse.
- Yes?

00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:39.343
The patient's awake.
Please call the doctor.

00:02:39.343 --> 00:02:41.445
The doctor is currently
with another patient.

00:02:41.445 --> 00:02:43.147
- Ma'am.
- Okay.

00:02:43.648 --> 00:02:45.116
- Executive Director.
- You shouldn't leave, ma'am.

00:02:46.284 --> 00:02:47.318
Where are you going?

What happened?

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:09.140
Explain it to me.

00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:13.444
Is what the police said true?

00:03:14.745 --> 00:03:15.846
Damn it.

00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:17.748
Is it true?

00:03:21.218 --> 00:03:22.620
Are you even human?

00:03:24.255 --> 00:03:26.157
How could you do something like that?

00:03:27.758 --> 00:03:29.293
Now, you're even turning Ye Eun...

00:03:29.293 --> 00:03:31.395
into a rapist's daughter?

00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:34.599
Yes.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.302
I've known you were trash for a long time.

00:03:38.803 --> 00:03:40.638
I just pretended not to know
because of Ye Eun.

00:03:40.638 --> 00:03:42.607
You've always disgusted me.

00:03:43.374 --> 00:03:45.209
I'm finally paying the price.

00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:50.881
My sin was choosing you
in the first place.

00:03:51.315 --> 00:03:53.351
What exactly did you do so right?

00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:54.385
Are you saying...

00:03:55.286 --> 00:03:56.988
this is none of your fault at all?

00:03:57.622 --> 00:04:00.591
Be honest. You married me
for my background, didn't you?

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:03.261
Because I'm the chairman's wife's nephew.

00:04:03.261 --> 00:04:04.895
That's why you came after me.

00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:08.799
You married me after doing all the math.

00:04:10.935 --> 00:04:13.771
That's why even when I was eyeing
other women,

00:04:13.771 --> 00:04:15.373
you never once showed a hint of jealousy.

00:04:16.274 --> 00:04:18.943
So why are you putting everything on me?

00:04:23.247 --> 00:04:25.716
Have you ever, even once,

00:04:25.716 --> 00:04:27.885
treated me like your husband?

00:04:28.753 --> 00:04:30.588
Every chance you got,
you called me an idiot.

00:04:30.588 --> 00:04:32.256
Every chance you got,
you called me a blockhead.

00:04:32.823 --> 00:04:35.726
So why is everything my fault?

00:04:35.726 --> 00:04:37.561
Why is all of this suddenly on me?

00:04:38.796 --> 00:04:40.598
- Damn it.
- Stop it.

00:04:40.598 --> 00:04:41.966
Let go of me.

00:04:41.966 --> 00:04:44.335
I wasn't like this from the start?

00:04:44.335 --> 00:04:45.569
Hey, let go of me.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.838
Do you have any idea
how much I cared about you?

00:04:48.973 --> 00:04:50.207
Let go!

00:04:58.683 --> 00:05:01.052
The more I think about it,
nothing about him was normal.

00:05:01.052 --> 00:05:02.987
- Even his looks gave me a bad feeling.
- Right?

00:05:02.987 --> 00:05:04.522
If you think about it...

00:05:04.522 --> 00:05:07.024
How can someone...

00:05:07.024 --> 00:05:09.193
do something like that?

00:05:09.193 --> 00:05:11.095
To think a rapist was right next to me.

00:05:11.095 --> 00:05:12.296
It gives me chills.

00:05:12.296 --> 00:05:15.032
Now that I think about it,

00:05:15.032 --> 00:05:18.169
he always ran his eyes over the show hosts
like a snake, top to bottom,

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:19.604
and it always felt gross.

00:05:20.471 --> 00:05:21.872
He always seemed a bit off, didn't he?

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.876
I thought he was just acting sleazily,

00:05:26.644 --> 00:05:27.778
but I never imagined it was this bad.

00:05:27.778 --> 00:05:30.715
If Producer Noh hadn't spoken up,

00:05:30.715 --> 00:05:33.250
there might've been more victims.
That's the scariest part.

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.022
I never even imagined
something like this had happened,

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:39.957
so I'm completely shaken too.

00:05:42.827 --> 00:05:43.694
Excuse me.

00:05:45.463 --> 00:05:46.430
Yes, honey?

00:05:48.466 --> 00:05:49.267
Really?

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:52.370
Honey.

00:05:54.038 --> 00:05:54.872
Hey.

00:05:56.307 --> 00:05:57.108
Let's go in.

00:06:20.164 --> 00:06:22.800
Thank you, Ms. Cho.

00:06:24.068 --> 00:06:26.404
Ever since I heard from Producer Noh...

00:06:28.406 --> 00:06:30.942
I really wanted to meet you.

00:06:31.742 --> 00:06:32.643
You could've...

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:37.848
just looked the other way, but you didn't.

00:06:38.616 --> 00:06:39.483
Thank you...

00:06:41.385 --> 00:06:42.653
so much.

00:06:43.921 --> 00:06:44.789
No, not at all.

00:06:46.023 --> 00:06:46.991
To be honest,

00:06:48.192 --> 00:06:50.061
I hesitated at first too.

00:06:51.262 --> 00:06:53.464
I didn't realize how serious it was.

00:06:55.666 --> 00:06:57.368
You must have gone through so much alone.

00:06:58.769 --> 00:06:59.704
Still,

00:07:00.137 --> 00:07:02.139
I'm so relieved
you woke up safe like this.

00:07:03.407 --> 00:07:05.142
I was foolish.

00:07:07.945 --> 00:07:08.980
Back then,

00:07:11.215 --> 00:07:12.850
I was so desperate...

00:07:13.451 --> 00:07:17.054
that I went to him,
trying somehow to make things right.

00:07:17.855 --> 00:07:19.757
None of this is your fault, Seon Min.

00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:21.926
Don't ever think it is.

00:07:22.526 --> 00:07:23.995
The real way you get back at those men...

00:07:25.463 --> 00:07:27.832
is by living confidently, with your head held high.

00:07:35.373 --> 00:07:36.240
You know that, right?

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.552
(Serim Hospital)

00:07:57.929 --> 00:07:58.996
Why?

00:07:58.996 --> 00:08:00.631
Am I so pretty?

00:08:00.631 --> 00:08:02.433
Yeah, so pretty I could die.

00:08:02.433 --> 00:08:03.301
Good grief.

00:08:06.137 --> 00:08:06.938
Thank you...

00:08:07.705 --> 00:08:09.206
for staying grounded
and handling everything...

00:08:09.206 --> 00:08:10.808
when I was indecisive.

00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:13.544
What do you mean, you're indecisive?

00:08:14.412 --> 00:08:16.147
You just went through more than most...

00:08:16.147 --> 00:08:17.848
because you still have a conscience.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.953
Honestly, I like you even more now.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:23.487
Thanks.

00:08:24.689 --> 00:08:25.990
On a day like this,

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.259
it feels a bit sad to just go home.

00:08:28.259 --> 00:08:29.160
Right?

00:08:30.261 --> 00:08:31.796

00:08:31.796 --> 00:08:33.297
- pork belly and soju?
- Pork belly and soju?

00:08:33.764 --> 00:08:34.999
- Deal.
- Deal.

00:08:39.203 --> 00:08:41.272
- We're in sync at times like this.
- Aren't we?

00:08:45.676 --> 00:08:46.677
Sang Min.

00:08:47.912 --> 00:08:49.914

00:08:54.018 --> 00:08:58.756
(Husband, not)

00:09:13.204 --> 00:09:14.372
Yes, honey?

00:09:14.872 --> 00:09:15.773
What's up?

00:09:16.107 --> 00:09:17.775
Well...

00:09:19.577 --> 00:09:21.579
I just wanted to ask how you were doing.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.482
I'm hanging in there.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.618
How about you?

00:09:29.353 --> 00:09:32.290
I've been slammed at work,

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:36.360
and between running around with Il Ri,
the days just disappear.

00:09:37.561 --> 00:09:39.964
You've been staying at Il Ri's
for a while now, right?

00:09:40.932 --> 00:09:43.067
That's not what I meant.

00:09:43.067 --> 00:09:45.503
Sorry, I said I'd move out,
but I kept dragging my feet.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.040
I'll pack up and leave today,
so you can move right back in.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.207
No.

00:09:50.808 --> 00:09:52.343
There's no need to rush.

00:09:52.843 --> 00:09:55.046
No, I'll clear out right away,
so just come home.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.448
We'll talk again.

00:09:59.016 --> 00:10:00.785
Yeah, okay.

00:10:06.891 --> 00:10:07.959

00:10:08.359 --> 00:10:09.794

00:10:15.366 --> 00:10:16.834

00:10:16.834 --> 00:10:19.337
One of our interns might get fired?

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.572
I overheard the general affairs team...

00:10:21.572 --> 00:10:23.474
talking in the break room this morning.

00:10:24.041 --> 00:10:26.944
We've got seven interns in total, right?

00:10:27.345 --> 00:10:29.347
But they were saying that next month,
for some application,

00:10:29.347 --> 00:10:32.516
only six people would be applying
or something like that.

00:10:32.516 --> 00:10:34.318
So...

00:10:34.318 --> 00:10:36.821
I started getting nervous,
thinking maybe one of us...

00:10:36.821 --> 00:10:37.822
is going to get fired.

00:11:34.912 --> 00:11:36.547
This is 100 percent
because of Kim Jeong Sik, right?

00:11:36.948 --> 00:11:39.550
They can't touch your full-time husband
or Song Ye Na,

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:41.285
so they're taking it out on you
because you're an easy target.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.522
So what now?

00:11:44.522 --> 00:11:46.223
Are you really just going
to let them do this to you?

00:11:48.693 --> 00:11:49.660
Honey.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.365
I'll head in first.

00:11:54.765 --> 00:11:55.833
You two go ahead and talk.

00:12:00.972 --> 00:12:03.608
What happened?
They're ending your internship?

00:12:03.608 --> 00:12:04.475
Yeah.

00:12:06.143 --> 00:12:07.445
I'm really sorry.

00:12:08.346 --> 00:12:09.313
This is on me.

00:12:09.847 --> 00:12:11.682
Since those bastards can't take it out on me,

00:12:11.682 --> 00:12:12.984
they're taking it out on you.

00:12:16.988 --> 00:12:18.389
This isn't right.

00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:20.057
I should at least go to HR
and file a complaint.

00:12:20.057 --> 00:12:20.825
Don't do it.

00:12:21.759 --> 00:12:23.761
What if you end up getting fired too?

00:12:24.295 --> 00:12:25.563
And we have kids to raise.

00:12:25.563 --> 00:12:27.331
At least one of us must stay
at the company.

00:12:27.331 --> 00:12:28.399
In a way, it's a relief.

00:12:28.966 --> 00:12:30.968
When I told you to go
to the Ethics Committee,

00:12:31.636 --> 00:12:33.337
did you think I wasn't ready for this?

00:12:34.171 --> 00:12:35.006
So what now?

00:12:35.973 --> 00:12:37.408
You're just going to sit back like this?

00:12:37.942 --> 00:12:39.410
After being treated this unfairly?

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:40.244
No.

00:12:40.911 --> 00:12:42.013
I'm not just going to sit back.

00:12:42.813 --> 00:12:45.683
I'm going to push back
and do whatever I can.

00:12:46.684 --> 00:12:48.352
(HR Team)

00:12:49.587 --> 00:12:51.088
What exactly is the reason?

00:12:51.088 --> 00:12:52.657
There's still time left on my internship,

00:12:52.657 --> 00:12:54.959
so why am I the only one being cut early?

00:12:54.959 --> 00:12:56.427
I'm really sorry,

00:12:56.794 --> 00:12:59.230
but we just followed company policy, okay?

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.299
In the email, it said
"problematic collaborative conduct,"

00:13:01.299 --> 00:13:03.267
and "below-standard fit
with the corporate culture."

00:13:03.267 --> 00:13:05.703
My attendance has been fine,

00:13:05.703 --> 00:13:08.773
and the shows I worked on
all had great sales.

00:13:08.773 --> 00:13:11.809
Can you really end an internship early
for vague reasons like that?

00:13:12.877 --> 00:13:15.413
Honestly, I don't know the specifics either.

00:13:15.413 --> 00:13:16.948
So if you really want details,

00:13:16.948 --> 00:13:18.716
you should ask the in-house legal team instead.

00:13:19.517 --> 00:13:22.787
- Sir.
- Legal team.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:27.491
Yes, okay.

00:13:30.795 --> 00:13:32.496
Were you able to reach him?

00:13:33.531 --> 00:13:34.665
I got through,

00:13:34.665 --> 00:13:36.834
but the executive director is out all day
on business and won't be coming in.

00:13:38.002 --> 00:13:39.737
You might want to come back another day.

00:13:41.706 --> 00:13:43.574
Then, I'm sorry,

00:13:43.574 --> 00:13:46.444
but could you please tell him
I'd like to request a meeting?

00:13:48.613 --> 00:13:49.513
Okay.

00:13:49.914 --> 00:13:50.848
Thank you.

00:13:55.119 --> 00:13:55.987
Hey.

00:13:56.353 --> 00:13:59.322
Still, Sang Min's not a total lost cause.

00:13:59.323 --> 00:14:01.158
He handed you
that expensive house just like that.

00:14:01.959 --> 00:14:05.129
He may be a pervert,
but he's a pervert with a conscience.

00:14:06.664 --> 00:14:08.566
I don't know if I did the right thing.

00:14:08.566 --> 00:14:11.369
No matter what,
he owns most of the shares of the house.

00:14:11.369 --> 00:14:14.238
Hey, at times like this,
you just shut your eyes and take it.

00:14:14.238 --> 00:14:16.407
When will you ever make enough
to buy a place like that?

00:14:18.476 --> 00:14:20.745
If I end up with nowhere to go,
I'll have to crash at your place.

00:14:20.745 --> 00:14:23.114
So stop overthinking it and take it.

00:14:23.114 --> 00:14:24.682
What are you talking about?

00:14:24.682 --> 00:14:26.550
You're about to get married.

00:14:26.984 --> 00:14:29.086
Right, and this.

00:14:29.086 --> 00:14:31.222
It's a little gift
for all the times I've mooched off you.

00:14:31.589 --> 00:14:33.724
What is all this?

00:14:36.594 --> 00:14:40.031
I liked yours so much
that I nearly used it all up.

00:14:40.031 --> 00:14:41.832
Thanks to that, don't you think
I've gotten a bit prettier?

00:14:42.934 --> 00:14:44.969
You're making me feel guilty.

00:14:47.939 --> 00:14:49.740
My friend.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.777
Thanks to you,
my commute home never felt lonely.

00:14:54.278 --> 00:14:56.380
Now stop worrying about me,

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.817
and go be as lovey-dovey as you want
with Sang Gyu, okay?

00:15:02.053 --> 00:15:02.887
I'm off.

00:15:14.799 --> 00:15:16.033
Hey.

00:15:18.135 --> 00:15:19.003
Sorry.

00:15:19.637 --> 00:15:22.506
I tried to hurry, but work ran late.

00:15:22.506 --> 00:15:23.341
No.

00:15:23.341 --> 00:15:25.343
I'm the one who just showed up
without calling.

00:15:26.277 --> 00:15:28.346
I'll send all the house paperwork
through the attorney,

00:15:28.346 --> 00:15:29.380
so don't worry about that.

00:15:32.984 --> 00:15:33.884
I'll get going.

00:15:39.557 --> 00:15:40.358
Sang Min.

00:15:42.994 --> 00:15:43.861
Why don't you...

00:15:45.529 --> 00:15:47.098
have some ramyun before you go?

00:15:48.866 --> 00:15:49.700
What?

00:15:50.468 --> 00:15:51.269
Well,

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:56.240
I haven't eaten dinner,
so I'm a bit hungry.

00:15:57.408 --> 00:16:00.044
And you make really good ramyun.

00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:02.513
You keep the noodles nice and firm.

00:16:14.425 --> 00:16:15.259
Eat up.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.329
I made it firm, just the way you like it.

00:16:20.298 --> 00:16:21.565
As you probably saw earlier,

00:16:22.133 --> 00:16:23.935
if you want the noodles to stay firm,

00:16:23.935 --> 00:16:26.370
the key is to blanch them.

00:16:27.038 --> 00:16:29.507
If you parboil them lightly
and move them to the bowl,

00:16:29.507 --> 00:16:31.442
they cool down fast and get chewier.

00:16:32.777 --> 00:16:34.612
If you have bean sprouts, throw some in.

00:16:34.612 --> 00:16:37.248
A drop of fish sauce gives it a real kick.

00:16:37.648 --> 00:16:39.617
It's my secret recipe.

00:16:40.885 --> 00:16:43.154
Don't tell anyone.
You're the only one who gets to know.

00:16:44.255 --> 00:16:45.756
Let's eat. It'll get soggy.

00:16:59.003 --> 00:16:59.904
What?

00:17:01.339 --> 00:17:02.273
Why aren't you eating?

00:17:07.078 --> 00:17:08.813
The truth is, Sang Min,

00:17:10.081 --> 00:17:12.316
there's something I need to tell you.

00:17:14.719 --> 00:17:18.289
I heard from your mom...

00:17:20.057 --> 00:17:23.227
what Rebecca and Jessica mean to you.

00:17:26.664 --> 00:17:30.534
So I realized I had misunderstood things,

00:17:30.534 --> 00:17:32.603
and that I owe you an apology.

00:17:33.671 --> 00:17:36.574
I had no idea
you'd been through something like that.

00:17:37.208 --> 00:17:39.010
Either way,
I'm sorry I said those things...

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:41.379
and judged you without knowing anything.

00:17:43.914 --> 00:17:46.417
When I first saw those dolls,
I was so shocked...

00:17:47.818 --> 00:17:49.587
that I didn't even try to understand...

00:17:50.221 --> 00:17:52.290
and just decided
you were some kind of freak.

00:17:53.157 --> 00:17:55.026
After that, I looked things up online...

00:17:55.826 --> 00:17:57.495
and even asked a doctor.

00:18:01.332 --> 00:18:02.445
Where are you going?

00:18:06.203 --> 00:18:07.104
What's wrong?

00:18:07.905 --> 00:18:09.273
Did I say something to upset you?

00:18:17.281 --> 00:18:19.917
Did you really have to go that far
to dig all that up?

00:18:21.218 --> 00:18:22.386
Why are you doing this to me?

00:18:22.954 --> 00:18:25.156
Now that it's all over,
why do you keep trying to figure me out?

00:18:25.156 --> 00:18:26.824
Because I want to know you better.

00:18:28.292 --> 00:18:30.995
But it felt like you were never
going to tell me yourself.

00:18:30.995 --> 00:18:32.029
I was frustrated.

00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:34.398
You were the one person
I hoped wouldn't find out.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.035
I'd rather you hate me.

00:18:38.669 --> 00:18:39.770
Don't pity me.

00:18:41.472 --> 00:18:43.374
Call me a crazy freak or a pervert.
Curse me out instead.

00:18:43.374 --> 00:18:45.509
Why did you have to make me feel this pathetic?

00:18:47.011 --> 00:18:48.646
Do you have any idea
how humiliating this is for me?

00:18:50.548 --> 00:18:51.816
What kind of a man...

00:18:53.017 --> 00:18:54.418
wants the woman he loves...

00:18:54.418 --> 00:18:57.054
to find out the pathetic
and stupid history of his?

00:19:29.487 --> 00:19:30.888
What's up with the deputy editor
these days?

00:19:31.489 --> 00:19:32.390
No clue.

00:19:53.744 --> 00:19:56.047
(Sang Gyu)

00:20:13.798 --> 00:20:15.466
Are you looking for anything
in particular, sir?

00:20:15.866 --> 00:20:17.234
Actually,

00:20:17.234 --> 00:20:21.138
I'm planning to propose to my girlfriend,

00:20:21.138 --> 00:20:22.640
but I don't really know what to get.

00:20:24.008 --> 00:20:26.844
I've been asking her for a while
to marry me,

00:20:26.844 --> 00:20:28.346
but she keeps dodging me.

00:20:28.346 --> 00:20:30.748
I want to really make it clear this time.

00:20:30.748 --> 00:20:31.983
Would something like this be okay?

00:20:32.183 --> 00:20:33.684
Definitely.

00:20:33.684 --> 00:20:34.619
In that case,

00:20:39.056 --> 00:20:40.291
how about something like this?

00:21:13.257 --> 00:21:14.859
Are you busy tonight?

00:21:20.731 --> 00:21:21.532
Why?

00:21:25.202 --> 00:21:26.737
Let's have dinner here.

00:21:27.571 --> 00:21:28.673
I heard this place is famous.

00:21:39.317 --> 00:21:40.217
Okay.

00:21:47.792 --> 00:21:48.659
Okay.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.095
I'll make a reservation for seven.
See you then.

00:22:28.432 --> 00:22:30.201
You found this place
faster than I thought.

00:22:30.668 --> 00:22:33.371
It's tucked away in a corner,
so I thought it'd take you a while.

00:22:34.205 --> 00:22:36.040
I came here once
when I was covering a story.

00:22:36.407 --> 00:22:38.709
Right, you're a reporter.

00:22:38.709 --> 00:22:39.677
Reporter Lee Il Ri.

00:22:41.712 --> 00:22:43.414
You must be hungry.

00:22:43.414 --> 00:22:44.248
What do you want to eat?

00:22:45.116 --> 00:22:46.550
I'm not that hungry.

00:22:47.218 --> 00:22:49.854
Come on, at least pick at something.

00:22:49.854 --> 00:22:51.389
I searched this place on purpose.

00:22:54.191 --> 00:22:56.360
Just pasta, then.

00:22:57.895 --> 00:22:58.863
Steak.

00:22:58.863 --> 00:22:59.931
Let's get steak too.

00:23:00.965 --> 00:23:03.768
I want to treat you
to something good today.

00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:05.870
Okay? I'll order.

00:23:31.862 --> 00:23:32.997
This is really good.

00:23:34.198 --> 00:23:36.000
Nice vibe, right?

00:23:36.834 --> 00:23:40.371
This place is in the top five...

00:23:41.539 --> 00:23:44.508
for couples to relay their feelings...

00:23:44.508 --> 00:23:45.610
or propose and all that.

00:23:49.246 --> 00:23:51.616
Il Ri, the reason I asked you here...

00:23:54.418 --> 00:23:56.287
- is...
- I can't get married.

00:23:58.589 --> 00:23:59.590
I'm sorry,

00:24:01.292 --> 00:24:02.426
but we should end this.

00:24:06.864 --> 00:24:08.332
What are you talking about?

00:24:08.799 --> 00:24:10.568
I should've said this way earlier.

00:24:11.802 --> 00:24:13.904
I'm not interested in getting married.

00:24:14.138 --> 00:24:15.273
I don't plan on getting married at all.

00:24:17.675 --> 00:24:18.342
Hey.

00:24:21.078 --> 00:24:21.912
Hey.

00:24:23.114 --> 00:24:24.882
What are you saying?

00:24:25.216 --> 00:24:26.684
Why are you suddenly planning
to stay single forever?

00:24:27.218 --> 00:24:29.220
I'm sorry.
I should've told you sooner.

00:24:29.954 --> 00:24:32.089
I was just having so much fun with you...

00:24:32.089 --> 00:24:33.424
that I couldn't bring myself to say it.

00:24:33.958 --> 00:24:34.892
Wait a minute.

00:24:37.762 --> 00:24:40.898
Il Ri, say it so I can understand.

00:24:41.565 --> 00:24:42.934
What do you mean
you don't plan to marry...

00:24:42.934 --> 00:24:44.869
and you're not interested
in getting married?

00:24:45.569 --> 00:24:46.871
What does that even mean?

00:24:46.871 --> 00:24:48.606
You and I are on
completely different pages.

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.243
Marriage just feels like
way too much for me.

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:55.780
You know I hate feeling tied down.

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:01.018
I'm sorry for blindsiding you like this.

00:25:07.224 --> 00:25:08.459
Anyway, take care.

00:25:09.594 --> 00:25:12.563
Even if we bump into each other in front
of the house, I hope we keep it casual.

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:14.131
Wait.

00:25:14.732 --> 00:25:15.466
Il Ri.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.068
Il Ri.

00:25:28.312 --> 00:25:29.814
Lee Il Ri.

00:25:33.618 --> 00:25:35.886
You can't just walk away like this.

00:25:35.886 --> 00:25:37.355
What's the real reason?

00:25:39.123 --> 00:25:40.825
What is it you dislike so much?

00:25:42.193 --> 00:25:43.527
You said you liked me too.

00:25:44.295 --> 00:25:45.963
It wasn't just me liking you alone.

00:25:45.963 --> 00:25:49.300
You said you were jealous
and that you liked me too.

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.134
No.

00:25:50.668 --> 00:25:52.370
It's not that I liked you.

00:25:52.903 --> 00:25:54.639
I think I just liked that you liked me.

00:25:55.773 --> 00:25:57.642
I think I just missed
having someone who treated me well.

00:26:03.514 --> 00:26:04.348
Then,

00:26:05.616 --> 00:26:07.985
why did you end up not liking me?

00:26:09.153 --> 00:26:11.088
You were the one who said...

00:26:12.857 --> 00:26:13.991
I was the person you wanted to marry.

00:26:14.959 --> 00:26:17.028
So was all of that a lie until now?

00:26:17.028 --> 00:26:18.696
Do I really have to spell it out
for you to get it?

00:26:19.931 --> 00:26:21.933
Do you honestly think
you and I are a good match?

00:26:23.034 --> 00:26:25.069
To be honest,
I don't even like you that much.

00:26:25.803 --> 00:26:28.572
I only went out with you
because I needed a guy.

00:26:29.273 --> 00:26:30.775
As for marriage,

00:26:31.742 --> 00:26:33.144
I've never once
seriously thought about it.

00:26:34.745 --> 00:26:36.580
Why are you overreacting
and crossing the line?

00:26:37.615 --> 00:26:39.984
Please read the room
and stop clinging to me.

00:26:41.886 --> 00:26:43.387
It feels outrageous
and infuriating, right?

00:26:44.622 --> 00:26:46.924
But what can I do?
This is who I really am.

00:26:49.794 --> 00:26:51.963
So I think it's best if we stop here.

00:28:18.082 --> 00:28:19.817
All done.

00:28:22.186 --> 00:28:24.822
I can't believe I'm showing you
this mess after 20 years.

00:28:25.423 --> 00:28:27.592
Hey, what are you talking about?

00:28:27.592 --> 00:28:28.859
Back in college,

00:28:28.859 --> 00:28:30.528
I carried your drunk self all the time.

00:28:30.528 --> 00:28:32.496
I've already seen
all kinds of things from you.

00:28:35.499 --> 00:28:36.467
Bye, then.

00:28:38.736 --> 00:28:39.770
Hey.

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:41.739
If anything ever happens,

00:28:41.739 --> 00:28:43.741
call me right away, okay?

00:29:05.229 --> 00:29:07.164
(Sweet Home Shopping)

00:29:23.814 --> 00:29:24.749
What's this about?

00:29:24.749 --> 00:29:25.650
Hello.

00:29:26.083 --> 00:29:27.885
My name is Cho Na Jeong,
and I took part...

00:29:27.885 --> 00:29:29.020
in the Career-Interrupted Women
Internship Program.

00:29:29.453 --> 00:29:32.223
I went to the secretary's office
and requested a meeting as well,

00:29:32.223 --> 00:29:33.658
but I was turned down every time.

00:29:33.658 --> 00:29:34.992
I know this is presumptuous,

00:29:34.992 --> 00:29:37.328
but I had no other way to see you,
so I came like this.

00:29:37.328 --> 00:29:38.396
So,

00:29:38.396 --> 00:29:39.563
what is it you want to say?

00:29:40.831 --> 00:29:43.634
I was notified of early termination
of the internship.

00:29:43.935 --> 00:29:46.003
Right after I reported Division Head
Kim Jeong Sik to the Ethics Committee,

00:29:46.003 --> 00:29:48.039
this decision came down.

00:29:48.039 --> 00:29:49.073
It doesn't feel like a coincidence.

00:29:50.074 --> 00:29:52.877
Wasn't this a retaliatory action...

00:29:52.877 --> 00:29:54.145
that completely ignored
my performance as an intern?

00:29:55.212 --> 00:29:57.782
You really are as bold as the rumors say.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:00.484
Ms. Cho Na Jeong.

00:30:00.685 --> 00:30:04.155
What do you think a company is?

00:30:06.424 --> 00:30:09.193
A company exists to make money.

00:30:09.193 --> 00:30:11.329
It's not a place
to chase after goodness or justice.

00:30:11.929 --> 00:30:13.397
Why do we run an internship program?

00:30:13.397 --> 00:30:16.667
To see how well you fit
into our organization.

00:30:16.667 --> 00:30:19.437
For the company to see you, Ms. Cho,

00:30:19.437 --> 00:30:21.305
who causes this much commotion
even as an intern...

00:30:21.305 --> 00:30:23.808
as a risk who disrupts order
and undermines the system...

00:30:23.808 --> 00:30:25.042
is only natural.
Don't you agree?

00:30:25.343 --> 00:30:28.012
But the higher-ups also thought
it was doing the right thing...

00:30:28.012 --> 00:30:29.914
when it launched this internship program,
didn't they?

00:30:29.914 --> 00:30:30.881
Well,

00:30:31.182 --> 00:30:34.018
to be honest, I couldn't care less...

00:30:34.018 --> 00:30:35.253
about that kind of image.

00:30:35.653 --> 00:30:37.188
That was probably
Executive Director Seo's idea.

00:30:37.955 --> 00:30:40.591
Stop feeling wronged and go home.

00:30:41.125 --> 00:30:43.227
Dragging this out
will only wear you down, Ms. Cho.

00:30:43.227 --> 00:30:45.730
I'm saying this for your own good.

00:30:46.364 --> 00:30:47.665
Executive Director Seo...

00:30:47.665 --> 00:30:50.301
shouldn't have started
such a pointless project.

00:30:50.301 --> 00:30:52.036
All it does is give people headaches.

00:31:19.897 --> 00:31:22.767
So that means Ms. Cho is the only one
being dropped from the internship,

00:31:22.767 --> 00:31:23.734
right?

00:31:23.734 --> 00:31:26.270
To be honest,
ever since Ms. Cho started speaking up,

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:29.740
I've been on edge,
worried the fallout might hit us.

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:32.009
Why did she have to meddle
in someone else's business...

00:31:32.009 --> 00:31:33.644
and end up getting herself fired?

00:31:33.644 --> 00:31:35.579
If she'd just stayed quiet,
she would've stayed safely in the middle.

00:31:35.579 --> 00:31:37.949
Her husband was unfairly framed.

00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:39.450
That's what this is about, right?

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:42.553
I don't get her husband either.

00:31:42.553 --> 00:31:45.089
I mean,
what kind of amazing junior is she...

00:31:45.089 --> 00:31:47.124
that he's so desperate
to stick his neck out for her?

00:31:47.124 --> 00:31:49.560
And in the end,
he just ruined an innocent wife.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.530
But thanks to that,
we got rid of one competitor.

00:31:53.531 --> 00:31:56.934
What kind of bullshit
is this supposed to be?

00:31:56.934 --> 00:31:57.969
Mi Sook.

00:32:01.339 --> 00:32:03.140
Ms. Cho, you were standing there?

00:32:03.841 --> 00:32:06.410
I was just worried about you, that's all.

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:08.613
How can you even say something like that?

00:32:09.146 --> 00:32:11.215
What? It was wrong to meddle
in someone else's business?

00:32:11.215 --> 00:32:13.351
Helping a junior was a stupid move?

00:32:14.852 --> 00:32:18.222
After all that hell she went through,
she got a rapist out of our way.

00:32:18.222 --> 00:32:19.924
So how can you say something like that?

00:32:20.258 --> 00:32:21.325
Why are you pointing fingers
not at the one who did wrong,

00:32:21.325 --> 00:32:23.594
but at the one who kept her conscience?

00:32:24.328 --> 00:32:25.763
Try putting yourself in Seon Min's shoes.

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:27.965
If that had happened to you,

00:32:27.965 --> 00:32:29.700
could you still say the same thing?

00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:33.337
Ms. Yang.

00:32:33.337 --> 00:32:35.306
Please don't get so worked up.

00:32:35.306 --> 00:32:37.375
How am I supposed not to get worked up
after hearing something like that?

00:32:38.542 --> 00:32:40.878
On top of it all,
you're glad you got rid of one competitor?

00:32:41.712 --> 00:32:43.080
I can't even.

00:32:43.547 --> 00:32:45.750
Back in the day, you went on
about drinks with colleagues and all that,

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:48.352
acting like you cared so much
about relationships.

00:32:48.352 --> 00:32:50.187
It must be nice being so shameless...

00:32:50.187 --> 00:32:52.823
you don't even get wrinkles.

00:32:53.224 --> 00:32:55.860
How can you grow older
and still think in such a dirty way?

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:57.628
Why do you live like that?

00:33:01.365 --> 00:33:02.199
Where are you going?

00:33:02.833 --> 00:33:04.068
Why are you walking away
in the middle of this?

00:33:07.204 --> 00:33:10.107
If you've got something to say,
say it to her face.

00:33:10.107 --> 00:33:11.642
Don't whisper behind people's backs.

00:33:11.642 --> 00:33:12.643
Got it?

00:33:13.844 --> 00:33:14.712
Mi Sook.

00:33:15.146 --> 00:33:16.480
Hey, Cho Na Jeong.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.483
Where did all your old fire go?
Why just stand there listening to that?

00:33:19.483 --> 00:33:21.552
You should've gone for her hair
on the spot.

00:33:29.226 --> 00:33:30.962
I could've said all that myself too.

00:33:31.562 --> 00:33:32.763
Why did you jump in for nothing?

00:33:33.598 --> 00:33:35.433
What if your colleagues hate you now?

00:33:35.433 --> 00:33:36.801
Colleagues? No way.

00:33:37.335 --> 00:33:39.103
People who are happy
about knocking out a competitor?

00:33:39.103 --> 00:33:40.638
You can't call them colleagues.

00:33:40.638 --> 00:33:42.873
You should never let trash like that
stay in your life.

00:33:42.873 --> 00:33:44.575
You've got to cut them out completely.

00:33:46.644 --> 00:33:48.379
They're just desperate, that's all.

00:33:49.513 --> 00:33:50.748
They're career-interrupted women,
aren't they?

00:33:51.849 --> 00:33:54.218
This might be their last chance,

00:33:54.218 --> 00:33:55.753
so, of course, they can't see anything else.

00:33:56.254 --> 00:33:58.356
Even so,

00:33:58.356 --> 00:34:00.291
when people get older and live like that,

00:34:00.291 --> 00:34:01.659
it's just pathetic.

00:34:02.226 --> 00:34:06.063
You should never give up on loyalty.

00:34:06.063 --> 00:34:08.499
That's the only way you can grow old
with at least a little dignity.

00:34:09.634 --> 00:34:10.501
But, you.

00:34:11.936 --> 00:34:14.005
You were kind of cool back there.

00:34:14.438 --> 00:34:15.373
Girl crush.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.074
Please.

00:34:17.875 --> 00:34:19.877
I've always been cool.

00:34:19.877 --> 00:34:21.712
Don't tell me you've fallen for me now.

00:34:27.051 --> 00:34:28.653
Anyway, thanks.

00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:30.588
Go on in.

00:34:31.722 --> 00:34:33.291
Don't lose heart.

00:34:33.624 --> 00:34:35.426
If you ever need help, call me anytime.

00:34:36.394 --> 00:34:37.361
Good luck.

00:34:38.329 --> 00:34:39.096
Thanks.

00:34:40.331 --> 00:34:43.768
You've got to give it your all to the end
and make it.

00:34:44.201 --> 00:34:45.069
Okay?

00:34:46.037 --> 00:34:46.971
I'll call you.

00:34:47.705 --> 00:34:48.506
Bye, then.

00:34:57.448 --> 00:34:59.283
Noh Min Jun, over here.

00:34:59.283 --> 00:35:02.853
If you don't put lotion on your face,
it'll sting and hurt.

00:35:03.321 --> 00:35:04.855
- But, Mom.
- Yeah?

00:35:06.023 --> 00:35:07.358
Why aren't you going to work?

00:35:10.361 --> 00:35:14.031
I said I won't go to work...

00:35:14.031 --> 00:35:15.466
so I can stay with you two longer.

00:35:15.933 --> 00:35:18.603
It's really nice
playing with me all the time, right?

00:35:18.603 --> 00:35:19.570
Yeah.

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:20.538
No, it's not.

00:35:21.372 --> 00:35:24.008
My friends were really jealous...

00:35:24.008 --> 00:35:25.743
because you were on TV, Mom.

00:35:25.743 --> 00:35:28.479
Mom, go back on TV again.

00:35:32.183 --> 00:35:33.951
Come on, let's go now.

00:35:35.886 --> 00:35:37.154
You get some rest.

00:35:37.154 --> 00:35:40.124
I'll drop the kids off
and go to singing class, then come back.

00:35:40.658 --> 00:35:42.093
It's fine, Father.

00:35:42.093 --> 00:35:43.661
Please, you rest.

00:35:43.661 --> 00:35:45.429
Have a cup of coffee too, okay?

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:47.198
Let's go, guys.

00:36:18.462 --> 00:36:21.265
I heard you got fired.

00:36:22.833 --> 00:36:23.634
I did.

00:36:24.969 --> 00:36:26.871
I'm sorry. It's because of me.

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:30.374
It's okay.

00:36:31.175 --> 00:36:33.010
It's not like I didn't see it coming.

00:36:40.117 --> 00:36:41.285
You don't have to look at me like that.

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.121
I'm just reaping what I sowed.

00:36:45.289 --> 00:36:46.490
Now that I think about it,

00:36:47.458 --> 00:36:49.460
it was probably wrong
from the very beginning.

00:36:50.962 --> 00:36:53.030
Not long after we got married,

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:54.765
I saw who my husband really was.

00:36:56.601 --> 00:36:58.102
But I didn't want to admit it,

00:36:59.403 --> 00:37:00.404
and I didn't have the courage.

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:04.408
At first, the problems were small.

00:37:05.343 --> 00:37:06.677
But the more I closed my eyes to them,

00:37:07.144 --> 00:37:08.946
the more they snowballed.

00:37:09.714 --> 00:37:11.549
In the end, that self-deception...

00:37:12.316 --> 00:37:13.884
is what made everything blow up like this.

00:37:17.989 --> 00:37:20.658
I'm really sorry.

00:37:22.326 --> 00:37:24.729
In struggling so hard just to survive,

00:37:25.162 --> 00:37:26.931
I ended up making this happen to you.

00:37:27.698 --> 00:37:28.699
But...

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:31.569
I never truly hated you.

00:37:34.272 --> 00:37:35.706
When I said
that as long as you didn't cause trouble,

00:37:35.973 --> 00:37:39.377
you'd be the one
to get the final contract,

00:37:39.377 --> 00:37:40.511
I wasn't just saying it.

00:37:42.513 --> 00:37:45.316
I did hesitate because of Producer Noh,

00:37:46.284 --> 00:37:49.487
but I thought you were worth the risk,

00:37:51.522 --> 00:37:53.958
so I was about to make a bold decision.

00:38:10.041 --> 00:38:11.208
I'll fish another one.

00:38:19.917 --> 00:38:20.952
Yes!

00:39:31.455 --> 00:39:35.059
How can you not even dodge
something like this?

00:39:36.661 --> 00:39:40.364
Why can't you dodge something like this?

00:40:07.325 --> 00:40:08.492
Won Hye Jeong.

00:40:08.492 --> 00:40:10.628
Where on earth have you left your head?

00:40:13.264 --> 00:40:16.834
Didn't I tell you to be extra careful
on shoots when the client isn't coming?

00:40:16.834 --> 00:40:19.637
How did you end up scratching
something that expensive?

00:40:20.404 --> 00:40:23.307
It's just that the model is so skinny.

00:40:23.307 --> 00:40:25.376
While she was posing,

00:40:25.376 --> 00:40:27.078
she spread her arms way too wide, so...

00:40:27.078 --> 00:40:28.879
Did you warn the model or not?

00:40:29.647 --> 00:40:30.748
Hye Jeong.

00:40:31.282 --> 00:40:33.784
I know you're busy
because you're newly married,

00:40:33.784 --> 00:40:37.021
but you've got to keep
your head on straight during shoots.

00:40:37.021 --> 00:40:38.990
It's not like what we handle
is cheap stuff.

00:40:39.357 --> 00:40:40.791
Why are you acting like such a rookie?

00:40:45.863 --> 00:40:46.664
Hey.

00:40:47.865 --> 00:40:49.600
Why are you crying now,
over something like this?

00:40:51.869 --> 00:40:52.903
It's not that.

00:40:54.038 --> 00:40:57.141
I've just been really struggling lately.

00:40:59.143 --> 00:41:03.047
Before we got married,
he was crazy about me.

00:41:03.614 --> 00:41:05.650
It hasn't even been that long
since the wedding,

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:07.752
and he's done a complete 180.

00:41:08.486 --> 00:41:10.922
He gets annoyed with me
at the drop of a hat.

00:41:12.223 --> 00:41:14.125
The other day,
he didn't come home all night,

00:41:14.125 --> 00:41:16.227
and left me waiting until dawn.

00:41:16.227 --> 00:41:18.462
When I asked why he was so late,

00:41:18.462 --> 00:41:21.299
he told me to stop being so clingy.

00:41:22.066 --> 00:41:24.635
How can he talk to me like that?

00:41:25.202 --> 00:41:27.638
How can he already be sick of me?

00:41:28.105 --> 00:41:30.808
How does love change that easily?

00:41:32.176 --> 00:41:34.845
Ms. Lee, I think I made a mistake
getting married.

00:41:34.845 --> 00:41:35.846
What do I do?

00:41:36.814 --> 00:41:37.882
Ms. Lee.

00:41:38.816 --> 00:41:40.484
Okay.

00:41:40.484 --> 00:41:42.453
I get what you're saying.

00:41:42.453 --> 00:41:44.322
Go outside and get some water.

00:41:44.922 --> 00:41:46.290
What about this?

00:41:46.958 --> 00:41:48.926
This costs over 4,000 dollars.

00:41:49.226 --> 00:41:50.595
I'll take care of it.

00:41:50.595 --> 00:41:52.530
You just call and apologize later.

00:41:53.064 --> 00:41:54.265
What am I going to do?

00:42:21.392 --> 00:42:22.693
Yes, Manager.

00:42:22.693 --> 00:42:23.861
You heard about it, right?

00:42:24.629 --> 00:42:25.596
I'm sorry.

00:42:26.464 --> 00:42:28.299
Yes, so we were thinking we'd somehow...

00:42:30.201 --> 00:42:31.035
Yes.

00:42:32.803 --> 00:42:33.671
Sorry?

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.644
What gives you the right
to tell us to fire our staff?

00:42:41.646 --> 00:42:43.948
I'll just buy the ring, then.

00:42:56.327 --> 00:42:57.395
Yes.

00:42:58.529 --> 00:42:59.597
You're baffled too, right?

00:43:00.765 --> 00:43:04.702
I told you to try to rein in that temper.

00:43:05.469 --> 00:43:07.738
But Manager Kim talks
way too carelessly...

00:43:07.738 --> 00:43:10.775
saying we should fire Won Hye Jeong,
make her kneel, and all that.

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:13.744
Exactly.

00:43:13.744 --> 00:43:15.446
It's one thing for me to come down hard
on my own staff,

00:43:15.446 --> 00:43:17.548
and another thing entirely
when someone else does it.

00:43:18.316 --> 00:43:19.183
You did well.

00:43:20.151 --> 00:43:23.187
Thanks to you,
they seem to have totally fallen for you.

00:43:23.187 --> 00:43:25.489
They were all saying their deputy editor
is seriously charismatic.

00:43:28.025 --> 00:43:30.995
Think of it as using this chance to
get yourself a piece of wedding jewelry.

00:43:31.462 --> 00:43:32.363
Il Ri,

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:35.199
you're not going to get married anyway,
are you?

00:43:35.199 --> 00:43:38.703
So when else in your life are you ever
going to wear a ring like that?

00:43:40.137 --> 00:43:40.871
Here.

00:43:42.707 --> 00:43:45.042
I checked off the decent ones
on the intern list you gave me.

00:43:45.042 --> 00:43:46.077
Take a look.

00:43:46.077 --> 00:43:46.844
I'm off.

00:44:05.029 --> 00:44:06.797
What is she even talking about?

00:44:08.232 --> 00:44:10.067
"Wedding jewelry for me?"

00:44:11.335 --> 00:44:14.472
"When else will you ever
wear a ring like this?"

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:19.844
How can she say stuff like that,
like it's nothing?

00:45:03.254 --> 00:45:04.288
Damn it.

00:45:05.089 --> 00:45:06.757
(Na Jeong's husband)

00:45:33.217 --> 00:45:34.185
No.

00:45:34.185 --> 00:45:35.553
What do I do?

00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:47.331
What do I do?

00:45:48.232 --> 00:45:49.200
Is it dead?

00:45:50.468 --> 00:45:51.469
It must be, right?

00:45:53.738 --> 00:45:56.173
Why is it so huge?

00:45:57.008 --> 00:45:58.409
Seriously.

00:46:08.152 --> 00:46:09.787
These are the healing experience tickets
and hotel vouchers...

00:46:09.787 --> 00:46:12.523
our company recently sold.

00:46:13.925 --> 00:46:14.859
Actually,

00:46:15.226 --> 00:46:17.495
my wife has seemed really worn out
since she quit her job.

00:46:18.162 --> 00:46:20.398
I thought that if she went on a trip
with her friends,

00:46:20.398 --> 00:46:21.666
it might help her reset.

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:25.002
Is this asking too much?

00:46:29.106 --> 00:46:32.410
Mr. Noh, you're so sweet.

00:46:33.678 --> 00:46:34.845
But I...

00:46:34.845 --> 00:46:36.981
No. I needed a healing experience too.

00:46:38.115 --> 00:46:39.450
I was just thinking
about taking a day off...

00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:41.953
and going somewhere to clear my head,

00:46:41.953 --> 00:46:42.920
so this worked out well.

00:46:43.554 --> 00:46:44.789
Hey, Gu Joo Young.

00:46:44.789 --> 00:46:46.991
You should take a day off too
and come with us.

00:46:47.558 --> 00:46:49.493
We seriously need
a healing experience, don't we?

00:46:55.366 --> 00:46:56.200
Sounds great.

00:46:57.368 --> 00:46:59.837
Mr. Noh, thank you so much.

00:47:00.404 --> 00:47:02.206
I've been starving for a trip too.

00:47:05.943 --> 00:47:08.512
A trip? In a situation like this?

00:47:08.512 --> 00:47:09.447
Guys.

00:47:09.447 --> 00:47:12.016
It's fine. I'm really okay.

00:47:12.016 --> 00:47:15.219
I'm thrilled to have more relaxed time
with the kids.

00:47:15.219 --> 00:47:16.921
Why are you acting like this?

00:47:16.921 --> 00:47:17.888
Okay, enough.

00:47:18.089 --> 00:47:20.224
Don't say anything,
and go get some real rest.

00:47:20.224 --> 00:47:21.826
Dad and I will take good care of the kids.

00:47:21.826 --> 00:47:23.094
Seriously?

00:47:23.094 --> 00:47:23.928
Right.

00:47:27.965 --> 00:47:29.400
I'll put this in your bag.

00:47:30.368 --> 00:47:32.403
You're going to eat lots of delicious food
with your friends,

00:47:32.403 --> 00:47:33.371
so you'll need this to keep in shape.

00:47:34.705 --> 00:47:37.008
It's fine. Wait.

00:47:37.008 --> 00:47:38.309
Okay, I get it.
Stop, just a second.

00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:39.877
Did you pack your sunglasses?

00:47:39.877 --> 00:47:40.978
Yeah, I did.

00:47:40.978 --> 00:47:42.513
- Phone?
- Back pocket.

00:47:42.513 --> 00:47:44.048
- Wallet?
- In my bag.

00:47:44.048 --> 00:47:45.082
Still.

00:47:45.082 --> 00:47:46.350
Thanks. Let's go.

00:47:46.851 --> 00:47:47.752
Guys.

00:47:47.752 --> 00:47:50.454
I told you I don't want to go on a trip.

00:47:54.258 --> 00:47:59.063
(Wando, Island of Health)

00:48:06.938 --> 00:48:07.972
What's with her?

00:48:08.239 --> 00:48:10.408
Is that really the same girl
who was grumbling about not wanting to go?

00:48:10.408 --> 00:48:12.877
Why do you think
we like Cho Na Jeong so much?

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:14.712
She's so simple.

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:34.298
(Marine Healing Center)

00:48:40.805 --> 00:48:43.240
How did my husband even know
about a place like this?

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.342
He's so sweet.

00:48:45.843 --> 00:48:47.244
Hey, let's unload our stuff first.

00:48:47.244 --> 00:48:48.179
Okay.

00:48:51.549 --> 00:48:52.783
Look at the sea.

00:48:53.784 --> 00:48:56.320
When are we ever going to walk
a dirt path like this again?

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:57.555
- I know.
- Right.

00:48:58.155 --> 00:49:00.791
It's all thanks to big sis Cho Na Jeong.

00:49:01.892 --> 00:49:03.027
Thank you, Cho Na Jeong.

00:49:03.027 --> 00:49:04.161
- Right?
- You said you wouldn't come.

00:49:04.161 --> 00:49:06.264
All thanks to Cho Na Jeong.

00:49:06.264 --> 00:49:07.265
All thanks to me.

00:49:35.626 --> 00:49:36.627
Girls.

00:49:37.561 --> 00:49:40.398
I feel like it's been forever
since I got a massage.

00:49:42.133 --> 00:49:44.368
I should've done things like this sooner.

00:49:44.802 --> 00:49:46.637
Aren't you glad we came, Cho Naraeng?

00:49:47.371 --> 00:49:48.205
Yeah.

00:49:50.141 --> 00:49:51.909
This feels so good.

00:49:53.644 --> 00:49:54.812
So refreshing.

00:49:58.549 --> 00:50:00.351
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:50:05.056 --> 00:50:06.123
Abalone.

00:50:07.725 --> 00:50:10.328
We're at the seaside,
so we've got to eat abalone.

00:50:10.328 --> 00:50:12.229
- They're huge.
- Right?

00:50:12.229 --> 00:50:14.398
Eat up and get your strength back.
This is on Producer Noh's card.

00:50:15.933 --> 00:50:17.668
Mr. Noh, thank you.

00:50:17.668 --> 00:50:19.070
We'll enjoy it.

00:50:20.071 --> 00:50:22.506
Look at this abalone, can you believe it?

00:50:22.506 --> 00:50:23.608
The cold raw fish soup is so good too.

00:50:23.608 --> 00:50:24.508
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:50:25.409 --> 00:50:26.344
That's it.

00:50:27.812 --> 00:50:28.846
Hey, look at that bridge.

00:50:29.747 --> 00:50:31.282
It's beautiful.

00:50:31.282 --> 00:50:33.451
The night view is insane.

00:50:33.451 --> 00:50:34.418
That's a ship?

00:50:34.418 --> 00:50:36.420
They say that the ship goes
all the way to Jeju.

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:38.222
- Really?
- I see.

00:50:38.856 --> 00:50:39.824
What's that one?

00:50:40.791 --> 00:50:43.261
Looking at the night view
makes me crave a beer.

00:50:43.894 --> 00:50:45.263
Same here.

00:50:59.744 --> 00:51:01.345
This is really nice.

00:51:04.015 --> 00:51:05.449
Now, spill it, Cho Naraeng.

00:51:06.217 --> 00:51:08.586
If you were going to enjoy it this much,
why did you insist on not coming?

00:51:09.687 --> 00:51:11.455
Did getting fired make you that depressed?

00:51:12.924 --> 00:51:14.191
Of course, I was depressed.

00:51:14.926 --> 00:51:16.827
Losing my job was depressing, but...

00:51:18.095 --> 00:51:19.130
How do I put it?

00:51:20.097 --> 00:51:23.334
I felt this huge wall called "society."

00:51:24.068 --> 00:51:27.238
It felt like Cho Na Jeong...

00:51:27.571 --> 00:51:29.006
was being rejected.

00:51:29.907 --> 00:51:31.075
They'll let me live as somebody's mom,

00:51:31.375 --> 00:51:33.611
as somebody's daughter,

00:51:33.611 --> 00:51:35.079
but not as Cho Na Jeong.

00:51:35.079 --> 00:51:36.147
"Just give it up already."

00:51:36.147 --> 00:51:37.982
Feeling like I was being boycotted
like that,

00:51:37.982 --> 00:51:39.483
I just sank into this endless gloom.

00:51:41.752 --> 00:51:43.020
Why does the world act...

00:51:43.621 --> 00:51:45.790
like even a mom having a dream...

00:51:46.324 --> 00:51:47.825
is some kind of luxury?

00:51:48.893 --> 00:51:51.095
It's that company that's really messed up.

00:51:51.095 --> 00:51:53.698
Who treats the person who reported
a rapist like that and kicks her out?

00:51:56.801 --> 00:51:59.003
Still, I went all in
and gave it everything I had,

00:51:59.003 --> 00:52:00.137
so I don't have any regrets.

00:52:01.906 --> 00:52:05.042
Hey, let's stop with the gloomy talk now,

00:52:05.042 --> 00:52:06.243
and go hang out downtown.

00:52:06.243 --> 00:52:07.979
- Let's go.
- Let's go. Sounds good.

00:52:15.987 --> 00:52:19.056
The abalone really are bigger
since we're right at the source.

00:52:19.056 --> 00:52:20.424
They're so fresh.

00:52:20.424 --> 00:52:22.193
My kids love abalone too.

00:52:22.193 --> 00:52:23.461
I should buy some to take home.

00:52:23.461 --> 00:52:25.830
Excuse me, can you ship this to Seoul?

00:52:25.830 --> 00:52:27.498
Sure, we'll send it right away.

00:52:28.532 --> 00:52:29.667
Guys.

00:52:29.667 --> 00:52:31.235
Big sis is buying.
Get some for yourselves too.

00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:34.005
Ta-da.

00:52:35.139 --> 00:52:36.574
One kilogram each, please.

00:52:36.574 --> 00:52:37.775
- With this one?
- Yes.

00:52:38.976 --> 00:52:39.810
Look at the size.

00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:41.946
- They're fresh.
- Super fresh.

00:52:43.347 --> 00:52:44.582
- This is fun.
- It is.

00:52:44.582 --> 00:52:46.250
Where should we go now?

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:47.518
Where should we go?

00:52:48.753 --> 00:52:49.887
- Hey.
- Yeah?

00:52:50.588 --> 00:52:51.822
Isn't that a fortune-telling shop?

00:52:52.456 --> 00:52:54.225
There's a fortune-telling shop out here?

00:52:55.626 --> 00:52:56.627
Right.

00:52:56.627 --> 00:52:59.797
Last time at that Chinese restaurant,
the fortune cookie said,

00:52:59.797 --> 00:53:03.534
"A typhoon begins
with the flap of a butterfly's wings."

00:53:03.534 --> 00:53:05.002
That was mine.

00:53:05.002 --> 00:53:06.370
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:53:06.837 --> 00:53:08.839
Now that I think about it,
it's giving me goosebumps.

00:53:08.839 --> 00:53:11.575
- Why?
- Mine said, "Break the mold."

00:53:11.575 --> 00:53:14.745
"A new encounter awaits you."

00:53:15.746 --> 00:53:17.181
Rebecca and Jessica.

00:53:17.515 --> 00:53:18.382
Hey.

00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:28.392
A woman holding flowers,
a man holding flowers.

00:53:30.027 --> 00:53:31.028
Hey, come on.

00:53:31.028 --> 00:53:33.798
You can make anything mean anything
if you twist it enough.

00:53:33.798 --> 00:53:35.800
So what? It's fun.
Let's go check it out.

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:38.836
Let's just go.
None of that stuff ever comes true anyway.

00:53:38.836 --> 00:53:40.871
I'm more scared it might come true.

00:53:40.871 --> 00:53:42.940
We'll just listen to the good parts.

00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:44.275
Let's go.

00:53:44.275 --> 00:53:46.143
Hey, are we really going?

00:53:57.888 --> 00:54:00.558
Well, I...

00:54:00.558 --> 00:54:02.293
Don't say a word.

00:54:02.627 --> 00:54:03.794
You'll jinx it.

00:54:26.851 --> 00:54:30.955
You pulled out a knife,
thinking you'd at least cut up a radish,

00:54:31.722 --> 00:54:33.691
but the blade was nowhere to be found,

00:54:33.691 --> 00:54:35.793
and only the sheath was left in your hand.

00:54:38.496 --> 00:54:42.099
Then where would I find that knife?

00:54:42.099 --> 00:54:43.501
What do you want to hold?

00:54:43.501 --> 00:54:46.804
A knife, a sickle, or a spoon?

00:54:47.204 --> 00:54:49.073
You should think about that first.

00:54:51.175 --> 00:54:53.311
A knife, a sickle...

00:55:08.526 --> 00:55:11.095
You must have worked quite hard...

00:55:11.095 --> 00:55:13.297
trying to open a tightly closed door,

00:55:14.298 --> 00:55:17.335
but that door is not one
a person can open.

00:55:18.235 --> 00:55:19.236
And yet,

00:55:20.037 --> 00:55:24.008
inside that closed door,
the wind is already blowing freely,

00:55:25.209 --> 00:55:29.046
meaning your heart
is already pounding wildly.

00:55:31.749 --> 00:55:34.352
What does that...

00:55:34.352 --> 00:55:35.186
Stop.

00:55:35.186 --> 00:55:38.456
When the Dragon King talks like nonsense,
you've got to understand it as sense.

00:55:38.456 --> 00:55:39.357
Why are you asking questions?

00:56:03.014 --> 00:56:06.083
You may think the land is dried up,

00:56:08.719 --> 00:56:12.423
but there are still flower seeds alive,
waiting for the rain.

00:56:12.957 --> 00:56:13.824
Sorry?

00:56:14.492 --> 00:56:18.129
Soon the soil will soften,
and the rain will fall,

00:56:18.863 --> 00:56:21.966
and then the flowers will bloom wide open,

00:56:21.966 --> 00:56:23.234
so you should wait.

00:56:49.126 --> 00:56:50.094
Il Ri.

00:56:50.094 --> 00:56:51.729
- Thanks.
- Welcome.

00:56:54.265 --> 00:56:55.099
Thank you.

00:57:00.771 --> 00:57:02.473
Guys, but honestly,

00:57:02.473 --> 00:57:04.175
wasn't that fortune insanely accurate?

00:57:05.142 --> 00:57:06.611
Just the sheath being left behind.

00:57:06.611 --> 00:57:08.045
How could it match my situation...

00:57:08.045 --> 00:57:10.381
so perfectly?

00:57:10.648 --> 00:57:13.284
But what did she mean by telling me...

00:57:13.284 --> 00:57:15.586
to think again about what I want to hold?

00:57:16.487 --> 00:57:19.423
Does it mean I should look
for a different kind of work?

00:57:20.358 --> 00:57:21.525
That could be it.

00:57:22.293 --> 00:57:24.362
Who says
you have to be a show host forever?

00:57:25.062 --> 00:57:27.865
You could use that experience
to find something else.

00:57:27.865 --> 00:57:28.633
Something else?

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.969
The most impressive thing
I heard recently was this.

00:57:32.503 --> 00:57:35.339
"You can't stop the wind from blowing,"

00:57:35.339 --> 00:57:37.508
"but you can change
the direction of the sail."

00:57:40.211 --> 00:57:43.414
Hey, then what do you think
your fortune meant?

00:57:44.148 --> 00:57:48.085
"There's wind blowing inside
a closed door,"

00:57:48.452 --> 00:57:50.388
"and your heart is pounding."

00:57:58.029 --> 00:57:58.963
Who knows.

00:57:59.363 --> 00:58:02.133
Why is your face suddenly so red?

00:58:02.133 --> 00:58:02.934
Wait.

00:58:02.934 --> 00:58:05.136
Hey, could it be...

00:58:05.136 --> 00:58:07.171
that a man who makes your heart race
has shown up?

00:58:07.171 --> 00:58:08.706
No, that's not it.

00:58:08.706 --> 00:58:11.542
It is.

00:58:11.542 --> 00:58:13.744
No matter who it is, just meet him.

00:58:13.744 --> 00:58:15.279
At a time like this,
when your future is so wide open,

00:58:15.279 --> 00:58:18.082
you should hurry up
and meet someone and fall hard in love.

00:58:18.082 --> 00:58:19.750
I said it's not like that.

00:58:22.286 --> 00:58:23.187
Lee Il Ri.

00:58:23.521 --> 00:58:25.056
What's with your face since earlier?

00:58:26.324 --> 00:58:27.124
What about it?

00:58:27.124 --> 00:58:28.392
Out of the three of us,

00:58:28.693 --> 00:58:30.928
your fortune was the most romantic.

00:58:31.629 --> 00:58:34.332
So you're the land, Lee Il Ri,

00:58:34.332 --> 00:58:36.400
and the rain must be Sang Gyu.

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.436
And the flowers
blooming wide open mean...

00:58:39.236 --> 00:58:41.539
you two might even get married, right?

00:58:42.106 --> 00:58:42.940
Yeah.

00:58:45.977 --> 00:58:47.078
Marriage, my ass.

00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:52.483
Hey, did something happen
between you and Sang Gyu?

00:58:53.551 --> 00:58:54.418
Nothing happened.

00:58:55.319 --> 00:58:56.654
Then why are you acting like this?

00:58:57.588 --> 00:58:58.956
Did you fight with Sang Gyu?

00:59:01.826 --> 00:59:03.427
She did.

00:59:03.427 --> 00:59:05.096
You had a lovers' quarrel.

00:59:05.096 --> 00:59:06.998
You poked at Sang Gyu again, didn't you?

00:59:07.665 --> 00:59:09.767
Acting tough like a kid,

00:59:09.767 --> 00:59:11.369
running your mouth and all that, right?

00:59:11.369 --> 00:59:12.470
Come on.

00:59:12.937 --> 00:59:14.372
I said no.

00:59:15.439 --> 00:59:18.009
Whatever it was, make up quickly.

00:59:18.676 --> 00:59:20.845
From what I can see,
Sang Gyu is the best guy...

00:59:20.845 --> 00:59:22.713
- out of all the men you've dated.
- Yeah.

00:59:22.713 --> 00:59:24.915
I really think you absolutely
have to marry Sang Gyu.

00:59:24.915 --> 00:59:26.017
That's right.

00:59:26.017 --> 00:59:28.219
Stop it. You don't know anything.

00:59:31.422 --> 00:59:33.724
Can't you just say it straight?

00:59:33.958 --> 00:59:35.226
How serious is it?

00:59:37.862 --> 00:59:38.930
We broke up.

00:59:39.463 --> 00:59:40.398
- What?
- What?

00:59:42.199 --> 00:59:44.201
Why? Why did you break up?

00:59:44.902 --> 00:59:46.037
I told you.

00:59:46.037 --> 00:59:47.505
I only dated him
because there was no one else around.

00:59:47.505 --> 00:59:49.273
I said if it didn't feel right,
I'd break up right away.

00:59:49.907 --> 00:59:52.209
Our personalities didn't match,
and I just couldn't keep seeing him.

00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:54.612
He's old-fashioned and clueless.

00:59:54.612 --> 00:59:56.981
Lee Il Ri, have you lost your mind?

00:59:58.249 --> 01:00:00.251
Being old-fashioned and clueless
is not a reason.

01:00:01.218 --> 01:00:03.120
How many times have we told you...

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:05.056
to please stop obsessing over appearances?

01:00:05.923 --> 01:00:08.159
After everything you went through
with Eom Jong Do, you still don't get it?

01:00:08.793 --> 01:00:11.062
Don't say another word
and call Sang Gyu right now.

01:00:11.896 --> 01:00:14.098
No. I'll do it.

01:00:16.701 --> 01:00:19.203
Please, if you don't know,
just stay out of it.

01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:26.377
Why?

01:00:26.877 --> 01:00:28.379
What happened?

01:00:29.013 --> 01:00:31.449
Did Sang Gyu...

01:00:32.817 --> 01:00:34.986
want to break up
because you're menopausal?

01:00:36.487 --> 01:00:37.488
That's not it.

01:00:39.023 --> 01:00:40.558
What do you mean it's not?

01:00:41.359 --> 01:00:43.961
You two were so crazy about each other.
Why would you suddenly break up?

01:00:44.328 --> 01:00:45.863
Why break up out of the blue...

01:00:45.863 --> 01:00:47.965
with someone who treated you so well?

01:00:47.965 --> 01:00:49.233
It's not that.

01:00:49.967 --> 01:00:52.169
He kept saying we should hurry
and get married and have a baby first.

01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:54.205
He looked at me with those desperate eyes,
saying his dream...

01:00:54.205 --> 01:00:55.673
was to have a daughter who looks like me.

01:00:56.207 --> 01:00:57.708
So how could I possibly tell him...

01:00:57.708 --> 01:00:59.744
that I'm menopausal?

01:00:59.744 --> 01:01:02.513
If I did, he would've just swallowed it
and insisted on marrying me anyway.

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:04.649
So how could I say it?

01:01:08.719 --> 01:01:10.621
I just thought my eggs,

01:01:11.889 --> 01:01:13.124
my youth,

01:01:14.025 --> 01:01:16.394
would just naturally stay there,
as they were.

01:01:20.064 --> 01:01:21.265
But that wasn't the case.

01:01:22.767 --> 01:01:25.970
Why did I have to meet
the man I love this late?

01:01:27.738 --> 01:01:29.640
My luck is really the worst.

01:01:33.177 --> 01:01:34.412
I'm sorry, Il Ri.

01:01:40.851 --> 01:01:41.953
I'm sorry,

01:01:43.721 --> 01:01:45.089
but could you leave me alone for a bit?

01:01:46.057 --> 01:01:47.258
I want to be by myself.

01:01:49.026 --> 01:01:49.727
Hey.

01:01:50.428 --> 01:01:51.429
Lee Il Ri.

01:02:16.153 --> 01:02:17.488
(Naraeng)

01:02:18.189 --> 01:02:20.224
Il Ri, where are you?

01:02:20.224 --> 01:02:21.359
Why aren't you coming?

01:02:25.396 --> 01:02:26.931
(Power off)

01:02:47.551 --> 01:02:49.186
Sir, check please.

01:02:54.191 --> 01:02:56.861
Why isn't she reading the messages?

01:02:58.496 --> 01:03:00.765
Hey, should we try calling her?

01:03:00.998 --> 01:03:01.832
Yeah.

01:03:05.336 --> 01:03:07.171
(Our Il Ri)

01:03:08.506 --> 01:03:09.807
The power is turned off.

01:03:09.807 --> 01:03:13.577
After the beep,
you'll be connected to voicemail...

01:03:21.452 --> 01:03:22.353
All done.

01:03:24.789 --> 01:03:26.390
Make sure
to loosen up your shoulders regularly.

01:03:27.959 --> 01:03:28.659
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:03:38.135 --> 01:03:39.937
Why are you overreacting
and crossing the line?

01:03:40.938 --> 01:03:43.474
Please read the room
and stop clinging to me.

01:03:55.453 --> 01:03:56.354
Doctor.

01:03:57.722 --> 01:03:58.723
You haven't left yet?

01:03:58.723 --> 01:04:01.626
I stopped by the pharmacy earlier
to get the medicine, and came here,

01:04:01.626 --> 01:04:03.561
but I lost the medicine bag.

01:04:03.561 --> 01:04:04.362
Just a moment.

01:04:04.362 --> 01:04:05.429
Where did it go?

01:04:14.205 --> 01:04:15.373
(Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun)

01:04:16.173 --> 01:04:17.308
This is it, right?

01:04:17.308 --> 01:04:18.943
Yes. Thank you.

01:04:21.145 --> 01:04:23.981
I'm sorry,
but what kind of medicine is that?

01:04:23.981 --> 01:04:25.683
This? Hormone drugs.

01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:27.251
Hormone drugs?

01:04:27.718 --> 01:04:29.553
These days, I've been sweating like crazy,

01:04:29.553 --> 01:04:31.923
and my face keeps getting all flushed,
so I went to the hospital.

01:04:31.923 --> 01:04:34.158
They said it's because my hormones
aren't being produced due to menopause.

01:04:34.625 --> 01:04:35.726
Thank you.

01:04:35.726 --> 01:04:36.627
Bye.

01:04:39.363 --> 01:04:40.331
(Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun)

01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:43.534
What is this?

01:04:44.869 --> 01:04:46.070
Hey, are you sick or something?

01:04:46.070 --> 01:04:46.904
No.

01:04:47.505 --> 01:04:48.739
It's not that I'm sick.

01:04:49.173 --> 01:04:51.575
I was just tired,
so I bought some vitamins.

01:05:11.562 --> 01:05:13.965
(Estrogen)

01:05:13.965 --> 01:05:16.467
(Hormone therapy
for women before and after menopause)

01:05:19.770 --> 01:05:21.305
Then when you get married,

01:05:22.406 --> 01:05:23.841
do you want to have kids?

01:05:24.275 --> 01:05:25.309
Of course.

01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:27.912
I'd love to have a daughter
who looks just like you.

01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:29.947
Actually,

01:05:30.815 --> 01:05:32.049
I'm an only child.

01:05:32.049 --> 01:05:33.851
So I was really lonely growing up.

01:05:35.052 --> 01:05:37.755
So whenever I saw big, noisy families,

01:05:37.755 --> 01:05:39.357
I used to think
that when I grew up and got married...

01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:49.400
The power is turned off.
After the beep, you'll be connected to...

01:06:21.565 --> 01:06:24.035
Where did she go?

01:06:31.809 --> 01:06:32.710
It's Sang Gyu.

01:06:36.747 --> 01:06:37.682
Yes, Sang Gyu?

01:06:38.149 --> 01:06:39.216
Joo Young.

01:06:40.217 --> 01:06:42.587
I just wanted to ask.

01:06:42.587 --> 01:06:44.055
I can't get through to Il Ri right now.

01:06:44.055 --> 01:06:45.389
Can you reach her by any chance?

01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.791
Sang Gyu.

01:06:47.625 --> 01:06:50.695
We came down south on a trip with Il Ri.

01:06:51.495 --> 01:06:54.065
She stepped out earlier in the day
to get some air,

01:06:54.865 --> 01:06:57.134
but we still haven't heard from her.

01:06:57.134 --> 01:06:57.969
What?

01:06:58.703 --> 01:07:01.005
Her phone is off,

01:07:01.005 --> 01:07:02.740
and no matter how much we look,
we can't find her.

01:07:03.808 --> 01:07:06.010
We hope she's okay.

01:07:07.011 --> 01:07:09.614
Hey, you guys should report it
to the police first...

01:07:09.914 --> 01:07:11.248
and keep looking around.

01:07:11.649 --> 01:07:12.650
I'll head there right away.

01:07:13.017 --> 01:07:16.120
Sang Gyu, we're too far away.

01:07:17.088 --> 01:07:17.888
Sang Gyu.

01:07:39.810 --> 01:07:42.013
We came from Seoul,

01:07:42.013 --> 01:07:44.515
and my friend doesn't know
this area at all.

01:07:44.515 --> 01:07:46.550
We also can't get in contact
with her right now.

01:07:46.550 --> 01:07:48.219
She might have gotten lost.

01:07:48.219 --> 01:07:50.688
So could you help us look together?

01:07:50.688 --> 01:07:52.857
Generally speaking,

01:07:52.857 --> 01:07:55.593
if it's just a simple runaway case,
no investigation is launched at all.

01:07:55.593 --> 01:07:58.296
She just went through a breakup.

01:07:58.296 --> 01:07:59.897
And she fought with us too.

01:08:00.598 --> 01:08:03.134
She's in a psychologically unstable state
right now.

01:08:04.001 --> 01:08:06.103
Just wait a little longer.
She might contact you.

01:08:11.409 --> 01:08:12.276
Il Ri.

01:08:13.110 --> 01:08:14.312
Lee Il Ri.

01:08:16.948 --> 01:08:17.949
Lee Il Ri.

01:08:20.351 --> 01:08:21.586
Lee Il Ri.

01:08:30.261 --> 01:08:31.395
Yes, Sang Gyu?

01:08:31.395 --> 01:08:34.098
Hey, where are you right now?
I'm almost there.

01:08:34.098 --> 01:08:35.933
What? Already?

01:08:36.801 --> 01:08:39.470
Yeah, I'm almost there now.
Hurry up and tell me where you are.

01:08:40.371 --> 01:08:41.672
We're...

01:08:41.672 --> 01:08:43.674
at Myeongsasip-ri Beach.

01:08:44.342 --> 01:08:45.643
Let's meet at the entrance.

01:08:47.478 --> 01:08:48.346
Okay.

01:08:50.314 --> 01:08:51.415
Il Ri.

01:08:52.483 --> 01:08:53.951
Lee Il Ri.

01:09:02.994 --> 01:09:04.495
- Sang Gyu.
- Hey.

01:09:04.495 --> 01:09:06.998
Hey, where have you checked?

01:09:06.998 --> 01:09:08.733
We've looked around most places.

01:09:08.733 --> 01:09:09.800
What about the sea?
Did you check there?

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:10.801
Not yet.

01:09:10.801 --> 01:09:12.036
- Let's go there first.
- Yes.

01:09:15.106 --> 01:09:16.107
Let's check over there.

01:09:17.308 --> 01:09:19.277
Il Ri.

01:09:20.344 --> 01:09:21.312
Il Ri.

01:09:23.814 --> 01:09:24.782
Il Ri.

01:09:25.683 --> 01:09:26.550
Why?

01:09:28.853 --> 01:09:29.720
What's that?

01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:47.939
Isn't that Il Ri's hat?

01:10:02.119 --> 01:10:02.887
Is it?

01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.288
Is that Il Ri's hat?

01:11:24.201 --> 01:11:26.304
(Don't call me ma'am)

01:11:26.704 --> 01:11:30.174
I've never once imagined
a life without Il Ri.

01:11:30.174 --> 01:11:31.142
Ms. Cho?

01:11:31.142 --> 01:11:32.243
You!

01:11:32.243 --> 01:11:34.278
These days,
who waits to be told to go on air?

01:11:34.278 --> 01:11:35.646
You just go for it.

01:11:35.646 --> 01:11:36.614
Hello.

01:11:36.614 --> 01:11:37.748
In this industry...

01:11:37.748 --> 01:11:38.816
Na Jeong, you do YouTube?

01:11:38.816 --> 01:11:41.752
Do something that suits you, not this.

01:11:42.119 --> 01:11:42.987
What do I do?

01:11:42.987 --> 01:11:46.157
This is even tougher than home shopping.

01:11:46.724 --> 01:11:49.493
Who's the man who made your heart
flutter so wildly?

01:11:54.365 --> 01:11:55.132
What is this?

01:11:55.132 --> 01:11:56.767
The Cho Na Jeong I know...

01:11:56.767 --> 01:11:58.936
would never let this broadcast fail.

01:12:01.973 --> 01:12:03.975
