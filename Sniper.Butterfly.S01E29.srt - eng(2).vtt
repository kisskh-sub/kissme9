00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.780
Why did you suddenly...

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.900
What's wrong?

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.340
Suddenly post on Moments?

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.840
You came all the way here

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.900
just to ask about this?

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.940
Isn't this the reward you asked me for?

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.970
This reward is way too much.

00:02:26.488 --> 00:02:27.400
Then I'll take it back?

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.150
No.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.900
I really like it.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.010
I really like it.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.380
Then...

00:02:35.866 --> 00:02:37.577
Mr. Cen and Mrs. Cen have seen it too?

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.530
I haven't blocked anyone.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:45.810
Is that okay?

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.180
If I block a bunch of people,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.190
better not to post at all

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.577
or make it visible to only you.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.900
Li Wu, do you remember?

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.660
Back then, you called me,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.100
and I misheard your name.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:10.590
You said

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.570
you are a gift.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.850
And

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.120
you really became

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.100
a special gift.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.180
Thank you

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:23.780
for coming by my side.

00:03:33.888 --> 00:03:35.355
I should be the one thanking you.

00:03:36.844 --> 00:03:37.870
Thank you for letting me

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.940
come to your side.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.620
No.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.900
Cen.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.850
Cen.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.150
Hurry.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.150
What happened?

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.060
Quick.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.340
Cancel it for me quickly.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.800
How did I

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.000
end up liking it by mistake?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.460
Hurry.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.530
Come on, cancel it.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:18.700
Can it be canceled?

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.610
This one, right?

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.940
(A gift)

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.700
Done.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.930
So simple?

00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:27.360
Once you click it, it's clicked.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.050
Jin will definitely be happy.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.360
She's happy,

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.290
but I'm not happy.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.460
I'm always trying to reason with her,

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.410
but she doesn't listen.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.900
My lips are worn out.

00:04:38.488 --> 00:04:39.930
She only knows how to go against me.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.020
Jin is already in her thirties.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.460
We're still asking her to listen.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.360
Isn't that a bit

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.490
unreasonable?

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.100
I'm doing this for her own good.

00:04:50.755 --> 00:04:52.133
Pour me a glass of water.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.780
I know.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.460
You're worried she'll get hurt.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.340
But we also have to trust her.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.170
Recently,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.800
I've seen how much Wu

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.580
cares for Jin.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.360
I believe he's not the type

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.970
who only does surface work.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.530
I can tell.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:18.660
Wu

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.460
truly likes Jin.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.170
What's the use of true feelings?

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.100
Wasn't it the same with Wu Fu back then?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.510
Forget it.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.580
Don't talk about it.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.160
So you just want

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.000
to see Jin

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.360
afraid of getting hurt

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.780
and never fall in love again?

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.190
Besides,

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.488
we cannot find her

00:05:36.488 --> 00:05:38.600
the absolutely right answer
in such things.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.730
She has to rely on herself.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.170
Alright.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.510
From now on, you handle

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.660
their matters completely.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:45.730
I won't interfere.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.750
Got it, Mom.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.220
Stop nagging.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.260
Alright, I'm hanging up.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.020
Stop talking.

00:06:01.866 --> 00:06:02.750
Do you think my mom

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:03.930
is too idle lately?

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.020
Nagging me about marriage every day.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.830
I haven't seen her interfere normally.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.177
Whenever marriage is mentioned,

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.900
she takes on a motherly attitude.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.780
I really don't want to argue with her,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.730
but I just can't help it.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:23.780
Shen Yiyang.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.460
Are you listening to me?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.530
I am.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:31.490
What did I say?

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.100
Come here.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.070
I don't want to see you today.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.050
Go back to your place.

00:06:47.133 --> 00:06:48.888
I don't want to see you tomorrow either.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.190
Hello.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.100
The number you dialed is switched off.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.650
The number you dialed is switched off.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.970
Phone switched off?

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.530
Shen Yiyang.

00:07:58.155 --> 00:07:59.700
Are you guarding my door now or what?

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:02.730
No men at home,

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.930
so I'm not at ease.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.040
You're not at ease,

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.100
and your phone is off.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.050
If something happens

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.390
and the police call,

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.220
they won't find you.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.100
Battery dead.

00:08:12.111 --> 00:08:13.288
Switched off automatically.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:14.360
Locked outside by you,

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.490
I can't charge it either.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.000
So why

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.130
did you suddenly get angry?

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.540
My phone was off?

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.610
I wasn't really listening to you?

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.580
Or...

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.650
You really don't know?

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:42.890
I really don't know.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.770
I ask you.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.360
Has your family

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.650
hinted at

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.010
urging you to marry?

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:55.130
Yes, they have.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.650
How did you react?

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.390
Just listened.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:08:59.220
What else could I do?

00:08:59.422 --> 00:09:01.130
If they want to rush,
that's their business.

00:09:01.133 --> 00:09:02.222
What I do is my business.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.220
They can't force me with a knife.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.650
So you never thought

00:09:09.266 --> 00:09:10.377
about getting married?

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:12.370
Or...

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:14.360
you never thought

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.300
of marrying me?

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.770
So this is why you're angry.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:26.580
Alright.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.700
Then I ask you.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.420
Are you really ready

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:31.730
to marry me?

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.220
From the beginning,

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.200
I've been ready to walk

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.220
with you all the way.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.610
If you're ready

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:45.820
to step into marriage,

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.580
I'm ready anytime.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.850
If you're not clear yet,

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.300
no need to rush.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.890
As long as we're together,

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.060
whether married or not

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.010
is the same to me.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:06.580
I'm sorry.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.610
I just can't handle

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.490
so many annoying voices around.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:13.730
And seeing you

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:15.730
acting detached

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.370
and completely unaffected

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.300
makes me even angrier.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:25.940
What others think or say

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.130
is their business.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.150
We

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:29.370
just follow our own pace.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:30.770
Live well.

00:10:30.955 --> 00:10:32.420
Be together well, and that's enough.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:27.100
What are you writing?

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:31.100
Nothing.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:33.060
I...

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.100
prepared in advance

00:11:35.133 --> 00:11:36.540
the draft for the second round bid.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.360
I also have experience with bidding.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.288
I'll help you revise.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.060
No need.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.540
Just write casually.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:47.940
Why are you up?

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:49.370
I'm thirsty.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:11:59.890
Here.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:01.250
Thanks.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.580
Has your mom contacted you?

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.300
No.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:16.890
No sign at all.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:24.180
What's wrong?

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:26.300
I was thinking...

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.220
Maybe I should

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.320
take the initiative to visit

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.340
your dad and mom.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.100
No matter their attitude,

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:40.300
I should stand by your side

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:41.730
and shield you.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.340
How will you shield?

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:48.700
Just...

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:51.770
tell them

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.610
that it's all my fault.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.130
I was the one who pursued you.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:57.120
I forced you

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.100
to be with me.

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.250
Then I will take good care of you
from now on.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.840
I'll even include you

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.960
in every step

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:04.820
of my future plans,

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.460
and also make sure

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:07.790
they don't blame you.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:08.490
Let them...

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:10.650
My parents aren't mobsters.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.250
No one can force me.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.910
Even the Moments I posted today

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.890
had to be out of my own willingness.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:34.550
Cen.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:35.460
I'm back.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.130
You're back.

00:13:37.511 --> 00:13:38.270
What are you doing?

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.010
Come.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.100
Why take this out?

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:41.730
I'm tidying up the study.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:42.910
I forgot

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:43.700
what's in this box.

00:13:44.488 --> 00:13:46.466
This is something from many years ago.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.100
These are all things
from Jin's childhood.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:52.180
Albums.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.890
And some "antique".

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:58.970
Look at this.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.610
I'll connect it to the TV.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:04.850
Let's check

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.100
if it still works.

00:14:28.733 --> 00:14:29.750
See if it can still play.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.360
The princess is waiting for Jin.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.000
Happy birthday.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:33.777
It still works.

00:14:33.777 --> 00:14:34.300
Let's see.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.420
Look at this.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:36.700
Alright, come.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:37.580
Jin, come here.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.460
Come.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.670
Come.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:41.220
Jin.

00:14:41.622 --> 00:14:42.820
How old are you this year?

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.870
Six.

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:45.580
Six?

00:14:45.688 --> 00:14:46.510
Six years old...

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.100
So today for your birthday,

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.550
we first blow out the candles,

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:51.420
and then we make a wish, alright?

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:52.750
Come, make a wish.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:53.440
Make a wish.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.270
I don't know what to wish for.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.360
Mom, make one for me.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.320
Mom's wish

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.540
is my wish.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:14:59.790
Alright.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:00.730
I will make a wish.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.300
My wish is

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.060
that our dear Jin

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.550
grows up healthy and happy,

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:06.360
safe and sound.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:06.890
Alright?

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:07.770
Yes.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:08.340
Come.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.180
Come.

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.960
Happy birthday, Jin.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.270
Alright.

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:15.200
Good, come.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.244
I will cut it for you.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:25.890
Coming.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:33.360
Hello.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.080
Your delivery.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:34.770
Thanks.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.020
(Sent from Li Wu)

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:42.420
Wu.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.180
You finally came.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:45.940
Mr. Shen came early,

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.770
said there was important news.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:48.960
Rui, too,

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.510
asked several times whether you came.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:51.100
I know.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.730
They told me on the phone.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.800
The traffic was terrible
on the way here today.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:56.510
Hurry.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:57.688
We've been waiting for you.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.060
Here.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:03.650
Yiyang.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.630
So what's the news?

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:09.610
Can you tell me now?

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.480
I've been

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.630
pestering him for ages,

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.420
but he insisted on waiting
for you to arrive.

00:16:13.422 --> 00:16:14.180
I was so anxious.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:15.200
Two pieces of news.

00:16:15.288 --> 00:16:16.490
One is good, and one is bad.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:17.300
Good news.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.180
We passed the second round.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:21.440
The final round

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.970
is between another team and us.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:23.820
One out of two.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:26.940
And you just say it in one sentence.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.730
You kept me hanging for half an hour.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:30.700
And the bad news?

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.790
The other team is Kejun.

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:34.266
They skipped the preliminary review.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:35.010
Kejun?

00:16:36.377 --> 00:16:37.890
How can they parachute in like that?

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.730
This isn't fair.

00:16:41.111 --> 00:16:42.120
Regarding this proposal,

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:42.790
our company

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:43.970
is still quite satisfied.

00:16:44.422 --> 00:16:45.390
But there's still some

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:46.340
room for improvement.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.130
We hope

00:16:48.711 --> 00:16:50.580
that it can break out
of conventional thinking,

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.440
to give the audience

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.770
a fresh experience.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.200
Alright.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.790
Then we'll discuss it again

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.610
and provide revision ideas soon.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:59.670
Okay, thanks.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:00.730
That's it for today.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:01.940
We'll stay in touch.

00:17:03.066 --> 00:17:03.940
No need to see me out.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:14.650
Why isn't this working again?

00:17:14.822 --> 00:17:15.680
I think this version

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.100
is already quite brilliant.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.830
They actually acknowledged

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.590
many of the merits of this version.

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:23.400
They just want it to better align

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.100
with the tone of this subplot.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:27.350
But they want

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:29.030
to break conventional thinking

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.850
and give the audience
a fresh experience.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.540
How do we execute that?

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.610
Well.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.980
Jin.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.260
Do we still need
to maintain this client?

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.780
I'm not complaining.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:39.680
I just feel

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.422
that for jewelry brands
of the same level,

00:17:41.422 --> 00:17:42.000
like Meishan.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:42.977
We could also negotiate.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:44.780
Why hang on to this one tree?

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.000
If you two were getting married today

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.260
or engaged,

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:53.750
and could choose any jewelry brand,

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:55.240
which would you choose?

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:55.880
Meishan

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.850
or Kaixi?

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.066
Kaixi.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.410
Kaixi.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:02.890
So,

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:04.890
as a creative agency,

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:06.880
being able to collaborate

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.480
with old-money-style brands will help us

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.890
level up in this field.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:11.920
This is

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.200
a very cost-effective project.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.550
And I think

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:16.240
what they said

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.410
makes some sense.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:19.350
I have some

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:20.340
vague ideas now.

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:22.688
I'll sort them out when I go back.

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:23.820
You think about it too.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.100
We'll discuss tomorrow.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.340
Okay.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:29.750
Hello.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:30.830
Any styles you like?

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:32.170
We can help you try on.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.650
No, I'm just browsing.

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:50.960
Sorry.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:51.720
This ring of yours

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.880
is over five years old.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.240
According to regulations,
it can only be recycled at 60 percent.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.270
But didn't you say

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.540
it was 70 percent?

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.260
Within five years, it is 70 percent,

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.400
but the date

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.466
on this receipt is already

00:19:02.466 --> 00:19:04.222
more than five years and three days old.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.820
It's just three days.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.210
Can't you make an exception?

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:09.350
Actually, if you feel

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:10.240
it's not suitable,

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.733
you can also keep it for yourself.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.777
This one was
the main promotion model back then.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.044
It still looks good now.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:16.450
Forget it.

00:19:17.333 --> 00:19:18.240
The marriage is over.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.580
Keeping the ring is useless.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:21.590
60 percent is fine.

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:22.060
Alright.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:23.920
How about this?

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.444
We'll give you a big discount voucher.

00:19:25.444 --> 00:19:27.680
So next time you come
to the store to buy a ring,

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.666
you can use it anytime.

00:19:37.355 --> 00:19:38.850
I called you but you didn't answer.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:44.650
My phone died.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:46.300
How's it going?

00:19:58.177 --> 00:19:59.110
It's getting late today.

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:00.511
Everyone, go home and rest first.

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.580
- Thanks, Wu.
- Thanks, Wu.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.488
Thanks for your hard work.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.820
What do you want to say?

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.690
I realized a problem.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:23.240
Kejun has been in this field

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.370
for many years.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.510
Their accumulated contacts

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:27.400
and suppliers

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.300
are too many.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.510
Our current proposal

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:31.240
has no advantage

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.260
in pricing.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:35.100
Indeed.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.100
We overlooked this problem.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.370
There's still time.

00:20:39.444 --> 00:20:40.510
We're in the circle too.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:41.511
Let's find more contacts.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:42.980
See if we can control the cost.

00:20:43.177 --> 00:20:44.310
I won't talk to you now.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.170
I'll figure it out.

00:20:49.888 --> 00:20:50.949
You see, this isn't

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:52.688
a problem that can be solved
in a few days.

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:53.590
Today, you also

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:54.500
go home and rest.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.690
I'll contact the people I know.

00:20:56.844 --> 00:20:58.020
We'll discuss again tomorrow.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:59.340
Let's go.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.480
Rest well.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:02.890
Okay.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.450
(Are you busy today?)

00:21:42.555 --> 00:21:44.100
(Can you accompany me later to a place?)

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:45.690
(I'll go first.)

00:21:45.888 --> 00:21:47.466
(Shall we have dinner together tonight?)

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:49.310
(What are you doing?)

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:50.410
(Why aren't you replying?)

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:51.550
(So tired.)

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:52.580
(I'm going home first.)

00:21:53.088 --> 00:21:54.130
(Playing hide-and-seek?)

00:23:03.755 --> 00:23:05.311
Why aren't you going in to sleep?

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.210
Just a few days after the announcement,

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.540
you've already learned to disappear.

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:16.960
Ignoring messages

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.340
and even turning off your phone.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.170
Aren't you afraid I'd worry?

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:21.540
My bad.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.340
I was at the company all along.

00:23:24.466 --> 00:23:26.600
Only realized my phone was dead
after finishing work.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.890
I came back as soon as I saw it.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:31.890
Next time,

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.410
just go back to your own home.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.740
Alright.

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:41.300
Hungry?

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.580
Want a late-night snack?

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.370
I'll cook for you.

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:08.370
Finished work?

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:09.740
Not yet.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:12.130
A bit low on battery.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:13.580
Need to charge first.

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:16.580
Had some trouble at work?

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.210
It's fine.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.450
My ideas were a bit stuck.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.550
But after going out for a walk,

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:24.580
I got new inspiration.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.130
That's good.

00:24:28.222 --> 00:24:29.888
Next time,
I'll definitely accompany you.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.300
And you?

00:24:32.333 --> 00:24:34.340
Is the competition preparation
going smoothly?

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:37.540
Yes.

00:24:45.888 --> 00:24:46.720
What are you doing?

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.133
You haven't added the water yet.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.610
I got distracted.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:21.000
Are you

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.130
facing some difficulty?

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.540
Nothing.

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:29.260
Li Wu.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.680
Did you forget

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.740
you promised me something?

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:36.850
Alright.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.170
So...

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.000
If we compare

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:51.930
the proposal

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.030
we have now with our competitors',

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:55.210
we have no advantage

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.540
in pricing at all.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.510
Cheng Rui and Yiyang

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:01.610
are already trying

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:04.890
to find channels to control costs.

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:12.590
I'm not very familiar

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:13.540
with your industry,

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.610
but I think maybe you shouldn't

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.440
go head-to-head

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.410
with others' strengths.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.780
In just a few days,

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.350
how could you catch up?

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:24.370
They've been accumulating resources
for years.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.130
Yes.

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:27.830
But the deadline

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:28.580
is approaching.

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.920
We also can't

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.780
just sit and wait.

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:34.980
So maybe you should

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.890
focus on what you're good at.

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:40.850
What we're good at?

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:41.740
Yeah.

00:26:41.955 --> 00:26:42.960
Like what we're doing now

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.450
with this jewelry project.

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:46.680
If the brand values

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.510
deep experience and credentials,

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:49.650
they wouldn't choose us.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.030
We excel at creative ideas

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:53.311
and finding unique approaches.

00:26:58.270 --> 00:26:59.300
Can I request

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:00.690
to work extra hours?

00:27:01.711 --> 00:27:03.450
You're going
to pull an all-nighter again?

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:05.160
I won't be able to sleep in bed either.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.170
My inspiration has come.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.340
How about

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.300
I stay over there these two days?

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.822
I'm afraid I'll disturb your rest.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.680
Just this once.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.260
Okay.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.450
Quick charge.

00:27:37.244 --> 00:27:38.600
Remember to drink bird's nest.

00:27:39.155 --> 00:27:40.511
Add sugar when the water's ready.

00:27:47.888 --> 00:27:49.210
Working overtime again today?

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:49.850
Yes.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.130
It'll probably be late.

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:52.650
Then I should reward you.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.780
Do my duty as a girlfriend.

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:55.410
No need.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.888
Wait for me at home tonight.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:27:59.930
Come on, continue.

00:28:01.022 --> 00:28:02.640
(Integrated room)
Software algorithm optimization

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.920
needs to proceed simultaneously.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.960
Especially the compound
and equilibrium algorithms.

00:28:05.977 --> 00:28:07.680
Also, the cooling system
needs improvement

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:08.880
to ensure high performance

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.288
in high-temperature environments.

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:11.500
Any other issues?

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:12.610
Then we...

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.610
How did you come here?

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.060
I came to reward you.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.260
Treat your colleagues to milk tea.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.177
Thank them for taking care of you.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:24.930
Here.

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.890
Thanks, Mr. Shen.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.240
Mr. Shen.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.680
Your girlfriend is really pretty.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.890
Her smile is so sweet.

00:28:31.066 --> 00:28:33.000
I'm flattered.
Why are you telling the truth?

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:33.790
Go.

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:35.022
Distribute to your colleagues.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.440
Then we won't disturb you.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.410
Enjoy your time together.

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:39.980
Thanks, Chang.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.920
Milk tea's delivered.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:44.610
I'm leaving, too.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.500
Wait.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.550
Give me a ride later

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:53.450
to Li Wu's company.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.350
I didn't drive.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:56.020
I have a car.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.370
What if I don't come?

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.740
I want to stay with you a little longer.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.500
Is that okay?

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:01.540
Okay.

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:17.300
What are you doing?

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:18.930
Smells good.

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:28.900
(Environmental Protection
Research Institute)

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:35.370
Come on.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.890
Princess, please get in.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.450
Slow down.

00:30:01.711 --> 00:30:03.466
Do I have a bad smell on me?

00:30:03.488 --> 00:30:05.155
Why are you spraying perfume
all the time?

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.130
I'm marking.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:07.890
Marking?

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:10.440
Like a puppy

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.260
marks its territory.

00:30:12.488 --> 00:30:14.555
I sprayed my perfume in your office,
in your car

00:30:14.555 --> 00:30:16.450
and on you, all over you.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.340
Then if

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:20.240
any girl interested in you

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.820
smells my perfume,

00:30:21.888 --> 00:30:22.880
she'll know you already

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:23.820
have a girlfriend.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.680
Should I just

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.370
tattoo your photo on my forehead?

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.370
Sure.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.340
Does your institute allow that?

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:33.300
I'll ask later.

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.260
Li Wu.

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:03.890
You're here.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:05.740
What's going on?

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:07.000
You didn't

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.400
stay out all night yesterday, right?

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.370
I went home.

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:11.890
I just came early today.

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:15.450
Yiyang.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:16.890
Take a look first.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.020
Share your thoughts.

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:28.540
I see.

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:29.780
Got it.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:32.300
That should work.

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:34.210
Good.

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:37.100
Which one?

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.780
Can someone explain this to me?

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.170
Wasn't it discussed last night?

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:44.070
Kejun has been in this field

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:45.340
for many years.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:46.590
We can't

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:47.680
possibly match the resources

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.690
they have built up over years
in just a few days.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:50.720
So we can only do

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.690
what we're good at.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.820
For example?

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:00.020
Technology.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:02.640
We use technology

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.960
to minimize costs,

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.400
not just scramble

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.450
to find other channels.

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:09.170
There's one issue.

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:11.980
The energy-saving module you modified

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.170
is theoretically perfect.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.920
But our lab equipment

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:15.930
and simulation environment

00:32:16.177 --> 00:32:17.070
don't support it.

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:18.540
I already considered this issue.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.100
So I just wait for you.

00:32:21.533 --> 00:32:23.000
Are there any research institutes

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.555
in Yi City
that you're not familiar with?

00:32:25.244 --> 00:32:26.580
So you've been waiting for me here.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:27.930
Then let's go.

00:32:27.977 --> 00:32:29.177
What are you standing there for?

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.111
I'll be your driver.

00:32:30.111 --> 00:32:30.550
Let's go.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.020
Go.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:32.610
Go.

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:00.060
How is it?

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:04.488
The energy-saving rate didn't reach

00:33:04.533 --> 00:33:05.377
the ideal range.

00:33:06.355 --> 00:33:07.640
We still need to control variables

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.540
and adjust parameters.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.030
Zhao.

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:11.133
Can I borrow your computer?

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:12.100
Here you go.

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:12.890
Thanks.

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:24.310
Once tomorrow's results come out,

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:25.110
I'll immediately

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.780
let you know.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:26.930
Thanks, Zhao.

00:33:27.022 --> 00:33:27.930
You're welcome, Shen.

00:33:28.022 --> 00:33:29.110
Then we'll leave first.

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.740
Stay back.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:30.750
Bye.

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:32.300
- Thanks for your hard work.
- Thanks.

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:36.060
So,

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.830
this young subline

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:40.240
can take a completely different path
from the main line.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.210
Redefining the meaning of the ring.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.088
It doesn't have to be
like the main line,

00:33:44.133 --> 00:33:46.400
tightly linked to relationships,

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.690
contracts, and commitments.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.830
After all, the connection
between marriage and rings

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:51.740
was only assigned by people later.

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:54.680
Putting all that aside,
a ring was originally

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:55.755
just a piece of jewelry.

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:57.690
This idea is interesting.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.020
Please elaborate.

00:33:59.310 --> 00:33:59.850
Okay.

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:05.180
(Market Analysis)

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.500
According to our research,

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.670
the majority of Kaixi's consumers

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:10.380
are high-income women.

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:12.150
The number of other jewelry items

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:13.320
purchased by

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.880
these high-income women

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.900
far exceeds the number
of rings they buy.

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:18.710
After all, not everyone

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:19.610
needs a wedding ring.

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:20.770
So,

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.460
the concept of this young subline

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:28.290
is to give rings freedom again.

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.590
So that every woman, whether single,

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:32.420
in love, or divorced,

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:33.510
can have

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:35.460
her own Kaixi ring.

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:36.250
Very good.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.800
This is exactly what we need.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.060
A fresh, eye-catching idea.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.760
Then, we'll move forward

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.666
in this direction.

00:34:42.733 --> 00:34:44.110
When do you think

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:45.266
you can update the draft?

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.060
By Wednesday.

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:47.800
Okay.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.733
Looking forward to it.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.020
Zhao.

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:04.650
Okay.

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:07.500
Got it.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:10.100
Okay.

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:12.210
Thanks.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:18.580
How is it going?

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:22.610
Don't keep me in suspense.

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.690
Is it alive or dead? Be straightforward.

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:37.460
Alive.

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:41.540
Alive!

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.880
Alive!

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:43.730
- Great!
- Great!

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:48.100
Fantastic!

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.840
Next, we wait

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:50.810
for the final showdown.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:19.540
(Within five kilometers,)

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:21.330
(if your phone dies)

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:23.330
(or if I turn it off,)

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:24.770
(use this to find me.)

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:26.940
(Always online.)

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:46.940
I'm home.

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:47.900
Are you asleep?

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.020
Not yet.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:57.610
What are you doing?

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.440
I just got in bed,

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.210
about to sleep.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.580
When did you get back?

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.100
A little while ago.

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:28.400
Judging by this,

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.000
the intercom

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.130
has a pretty good signal.

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:31.650
Sounds clear.

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:37.330
How did you think of giving me this?

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:43.670
Previously, because I was busy,

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:45.290
I missed several of your calls.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:48.500
With this, I won't miss them.

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:55.690
Looks tacky.

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:05.060
You don't like it?

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:10.290
Neither will I.

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:29.380
Twenty meters.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:30.650
Can you hear me now?

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.210
Yes.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.330
Fifteen meters.

00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:58.250
Ten meters.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:05.500
Five meters.

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.210
One meter.

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:12.610
Zero!

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:57.690
Can't sleep?

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:06.290
Then why are you staring at me?

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:11.980
I'm...

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:15.770
counting your eyelashes

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:17.860
to induce sleepiness.

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:25.130
Are you nervous
because of tomorrow's presentation?

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:35.690
Honestly, a little.

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.900
And...

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:42.500
when I can't sleep,
I think about everything.

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:44.460
The more I think, the less I sleep.

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.060
I'll teach you a method.

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:55.730
Do you know diaphragmatic breathing?

00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:59.690
Like this. Lie flat.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.070
Then,

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:03.590
focus your attention

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:04.730
on your breathing.

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:06.510
Then,

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:07.500
inhale.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.070
Pull all the air

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:10.650
into your belly, then exhale.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.540
Your belly will rise.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.420
Then exhale.

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.840
I'm serious.

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:21.730
Try it now.

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:24.690
Inhale.

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:36.650
Inhale.

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:40.900
Yes.

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.540
Exhale.

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:44.130
Relax a bit.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.580
Asleep yet?

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:19.210
Let's sleep.

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:22.540
This method is still the best.
