00:00:08.746 --> 00:00:11.149
Inheritance, Article 30.

00:00:11.883 --> 00:00:15.086
After three consecutive wins
in the spring,

00:00:15.153 --> 00:00:18.356
Royal Family continued to increase
his prize money in major races,

00:00:18.423 --> 00:00:22.861
and advanced to his first G1 race,
the Autumn Tenno Sho, at the age of four.

00:00:22.927 --> 00:00:27.232
Currently, we have clear skies over
the Tokyo Racecourse in Fuchu City.

00:00:27.298 --> 00:00:29.901
The 170th Autumn Tenno Sho.

00:00:29.968 --> 00:00:34.839
For horse owner Koichi Nakajo
and jockey Shohei Nozaki,

00:00:36.107 --> 00:00:38.076
this is their first big stage.

00:00:38.143 --> 00:00:39.811
2024 FOURTH TOKYO HORSE RACE
HORSE OWNER SEAT

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.983
I wish Kanako could have come too.

00:00:45.483 --> 00:00:48.153
She said she couldn’t leave
her dad alone with the ranch.

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:49.120
I see.

00:00:49.187 --> 00:00:51.489
It's about time
she took over the business, huh?

00:00:51.556 --> 00:00:53.424
-Yes.
-Exactly. "Inheritance."

00:00:53.992 --> 00:00:55.493
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.662
Are you reading my articles?

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:59.063
-Yes.
-Of course.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.964
Thanks.

00:01:00.732 --> 00:01:02.133
When Shohei took over,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.203
I inserted some stories
from his childhood.

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.238
It's well received by the readers.

00:01:07.772 --> 00:01:10.475
I guess it's good that he's from Hidaka.

00:01:10.542 --> 00:01:14.946
He now carries the weight of defeating
Hokuryo Farm as Hidaka's rising star.

00:01:15.013 --> 00:01:17.649
The 170th Autumn Tenno Sho.

00:01:18.883 --> 00:01:21.252
-Today's attendance has exceeded 70,000.
-That's good. Okay.

00:01:22.187 --> 00:01:24.389
Dad, I'll do that.

00:01:24.455 --> 00:01:26.558
I can do this much.

00:01:27.692 --> 00:01:30.295
You have bad knees, and yet…

00:01:30.795 --> 00:01:32.530
It's almost time. The TV.

00:01:32.597 --> 00:01:34.766
The races so far
have been full of turmoil.

00:01:34.832 --> 00:01:38.503
Will the Autumn Tenno Sho
go to the favorite as expected?

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.905
-Mr. Kurisu, will you not get married?
-What?

00:01:43.308 --> 00:01:46.511
-Hey. He's talking to you.
-I heard him.

00:01:47.212 --> 00:01:48.146
Why ask now?

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.514
Well…

00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:53.384
We're all a little nervous, so I thought
we could talk about something else.

00:01:53.451 --> 00:01:55.787
Shall we go to the paddock?

00:01:55.853 --> 00:01:58.389
-Don't be shy.
-I'm not being shy.

00:01:58.456 --> 00:02:00.892
Don't tell me you
never plan to get married?

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:03.127
I plan to, of course.

00:02:03.194 --> 00:02:04.829
I even proposed.

00:02:04.896 --> 00:02:06.030
Oh, you have?

00:02:06.097 --> 00:02:07.565
Yes, years ago.

00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:09.567
But she said, "Not now."

00:02:09.634 --> 00:02:10.935
And since then, nothing.

00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:13.805
Could you bring it up?

00:02:13.871 --> 00:02:15.807
"About my proposal…"

00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:19.143
It's terrifying.
I can't bring myself to do it.

00:02:20.078 --> 00:02:21.846
-Sorry.
-No, it's because I said…

00:02:21.913 --> 00:02:24.215
-No, he also…
-That's enough.

00:02:24.282 --> 00:02:26.918
I'm sure Kanako
has her own idea of happiness.

00:02:26.985 --> 00:02:28.720
-Here, Dad.
-I'm sure of it.

00:02:28.786 --> 00:02:29.887
Maybe.

00:02:29.954 --> 00:02:31.022
Probably.

00:02:32.123 --> 00:02:33.091
Oh, here he comes.

00:02:35.526 --> 00:02:36.594
Shohei.

00:02:45.536 --> 00:02:46.804
Royal Family.

00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:48.373
He's in great shape.

00:02:49.007 --> 00:02:50.908
Yes. Thank you very much.

00:02:50.975 --> 00:02:55.647
Today, he is the second best
after our Rainbow Camp.

00:02:55.713 --> 00:02:56.547
What?

00:02:58.916 --> 00:03:00.318
Well…

00:03:00.385 --> 00:03:04.055
Sure, Rainbow Camp is a great horse, but…

00:03:04.922 --> 00:03:07.258
Today, our Family will win.

00:03:07.325 --> 00:03:09.294
Please take the supporting role.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.501
Our predecessor may have said that,
but we are challengers.

00:03:17.068 --> 00:03:19.137
We will challenge you with all our might.

00:03:20.738 --> 00:03:21.706
Excuse me.

00:03:27.478 --> 00:03:29.747
Isn’t that joke a bit too much?

00:03:29.814 --> 00:03:32.016
-It took me ten years to get used to it.
-Ten?

00:03:32.083 --> 00:03:33.584
Let's go too.

00:03:34.285 --> 00:03:35.153
Okay.

00:03:44.028 --> 00:03:47.965
They are midway between corners.
Gaspard Marilyn is in the lead.

00:03:48.032 --> 00:03:50.468
-The fourth corner to the final straight.
-Go!

00:03:50.535 --> 00:03:51.836
-The lead pack…
-Come on.

00:03:51.903 --> 00:03:54.138
Oh, a rider is down!

00:03:54.205 --> 00:03:56.607
Royal Family's jockey,
Shohei Nozaki, is down!

00:03:56.674 --> 00:03:58.476
As for the battle for the lead…

00:03:58.543 --> 00:03:59.777
Towards the race's end,

00:03:59.844 --> 00:04:03.548
Family, who had moved to the outside,
suddenly lost his balance

00:04:03.614 --> 00:04:05.717
and threw Shohei off.

00:04:07.585 --> 00:04:11.155
Family stopped running and stood still.

00:04:12.724 --> 00:04:15.393
The Arima Kinen
they are aiming for is one year away.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.097
It was an incident
that brought them to the brink of despair.

00:04:21.933 --> 00:04:22.934
Shohei…

00:04:23.935 --> 00:04:24.736
Mr. Kurisu?

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.537
Mr. Kurisu!

00:04:27.038 --> 00:04:28.306
Unseated.

00:04:28.906 --> 00:04:32.176
A racehorse can run at a maximum speed
of over 60 kilometers per hour.

00:04:32.877 --> 00:04:37.215
In such situations, jockeys are required
to make calm judgments

00:04:37.281 --> 00:04:39.984
to assess the horse's condition
and the flow of the race.

00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:43.721
However, racehorses
are delicately balanced,

00:04:43.788 --> 00:04:47.658
and even a minor abnormality
can lead to a serious injury.

00:04:47.725 --> 00:04:50.828
-Tokai Teio. Returning after a year…
-A wounded horse.

00:04:51.863 --> 00:04:54.098
-An unseated jockey.
-Rider Yuichi Kitamura…

00:04:54.165 --> 00:04:56.467
Their return to the track.

00:04:57.502 --> 00:05:01.205
Takes the love, wishes,

00:05:01.806 --> 00:05:04.909
and vast accumulated experiences
of countless people.

00:05:04.976 --> 00:05:08.446
ROYAL FAMILY

00:05:13.718 --> 00:05:15.920
Ankle fracture, huh?

00:05:15.987 --> 00:05:19.190
Yes, they said it will take
four months before he can ride again.

00:05:19.824 --> 00:05:22.794
-Have you heard about Family?
-Yes, from Mr. Hironaka.

00:05:23.394 --> 00:05:25.229
He has a fracture too.

00:05:25.296 --> 00:05:27.398
It will take about six months.

00:05:27.965 --> 00:05:28.866
Yes.

00:05:29.367 --> 00:05:32.003
He'll be recuperating
at an outside stable for a while.

00:05:33.471 --> 00:05:38.509
Luckily, we're aiming
for next year's Arima.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.547
It's going to be okay.
Family and Shohei still have time.

00:05:43.247 --> 00:05:44.649
Can you come to visit?

00:05:44.715 --> 00:05:45.750
I mean…

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.020
I want to go, but… Yeah…

00:05:49.587 --> 00:05:52.957
-Are you having a hard time at the ranch?
-I can't leave Dad alone.

00:05:53.558 --> 00:05:55.893
I can't ask for help either.

00:05:56.761 --> 00:05:57.829
I see.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.202
It's…

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.839
been six months
since I last came out there.

00:06:10.241 --> 00:06:11.375
I'll come to see you.

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:14.545
I also want to see
how the other horses are doing.

00:06:16.113 --> 00:06:17.114
Yeah.

00:06:19.183 --> 00:06:20.284
I'll be waiting.

00:06:26.591 --> 00:06:33.130
And so, Royal Family's 2024
quietly came to an end.

00:06:36.734 --> 00:06:38.536
The new year came. 2025.

00:06:41.606 --> 00:06:42.473
Ryujiro?

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.042
It seems that he'll be replaced
as So Perfect's jockey.

00:06:45.843 --> 00:06:49.647
Instead, a foreign jockey,
Christophe Lemaire, will ride them.

00:06:50.414 --> 00:06:51.382
What?

00:06:52.783 --> 00:06:55.586
Why now, when the Classic Races
are about to begin?

00:06:57.088 --> 00:06:59.257
It's just a strategy.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.096
Was that your plan from the beginning?

00:07:05.162 --> 00:07:07.331
No, it's recent.

00:07:07.398 --> 00:07:09.467
-Chef, another one!
-Okay.

00:07:10.134 --> 00:07:11.502
The other day, Saki--

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:13.237
That's fine in a game,

00:07:14.305 --> 00:07:16.474
but reality isn't that simple.

00:07:17.742 --> 00:07:20.244
Then, tell me that after
seeing this year's results.

00:07:21.178 --> 00:07:22.280
I'll aim for it.

00:07:22.346 --> 00:07:25.550
The Triple Crown,
which you still haven't achieved.

00:07:26.284 --> 00:07:28.319
It's hard enough to win one G1 race.

00:07:30.121 --> 00:07:32.390
If it's a horse
that can win the Triple Crown,

00:07:32.456 --> 00:07:34.425
you might not think that way.

00:07:46.804 --> 00:07:50.374
Shohei's comeback was
a Three-year-old Maiden Race in February.

00:07:51.242 --> 00:07:54.645
Although his return was a month
earlier than initially expected,

00:07:54.712 --> 00:07:56.247
he finished in 12th place.

00:07:56.314 --> 00:07:57.081
Shohei!

00:07:58.716 --> 00:07:59.717
I'm sorry.

00:08:00.551 --> 00:08:02.853
This is just the start. Don't rush.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.854
Yes.

00:08:07.191 --> 00:08:12.363
After that, he was unable to place
in any of the races he rode in.

00:08:16.834 --> 00:08:19.337
-Sorry for always asking for your help.
-Don't be.

00:08:19.403 --> 00:08:23.007
Meanwhile, Family finished recuperating

00:08:23.074 --> 00:08:27.044
and headed to Hokkaido for pasture
in the hopes of a speedy recovery.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.916
Kurisu visited Hidaka

00:08:31.983 --> 00:08:36.187
a week after Family returned
to Nozaki Farm.

00:08:36.988 --> 00:08:40.691
I'm a little bit concerned about my leg.
The horse isn't reacting properly.

00:08:41.258 --> 00:08:42.393
It's okay.

00:08:43.761 --> 00:08:45.896
It's only been half a month
since his comeback.

00:08:45.963 --> 00:08:48.566
He seems fine on the phone.

00:08:48.633 --> 00:08:51.802
Maybe he went back too early, after all.

00:08:51.869 --> 00:08:53.971
The doctor has given the go-ahead.

00:08:54.038 --> 00:08:56.140
He also said
he didn't want to leave any gaps.

00:08:56.207 --> 00:08:57.508
Right.

00:09:04.115 --> 00:09:06.317
He's a little bit restless.

00:09:06.384 --> 00:09:09.186
Yes. He's been like that
since he came back.

00:09:09.253 --> 00:09:10.087
Really?

00:09:10.154 --> 00:09:11.389
-Yeah.
-Hey.

00:09:12.456 --> 00:09:13.724
Hello.

00:09:14.225 --> 00:09:18.629
I think Family should get looked at again.

00:09:18.696 --> 00:09:21.132
But they said his leg is fine now.

00:09:21.198 --> 00:09:23.501
No, it's not his leg.

00:09:23.567 --> 00:09:25.469
Tears are coming out.

00:09:25.536 --> 00:09:26.804
He's in pain.

00:09:27.571 --> 00:09:28.739
In his right eye.

00:09:29.674 --> 00:09:30.508
Right eye?

00:09:35.146 --> 00:09:39.884
Family then underwent intensive treatment

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:43.654
through antibiotic eye drops to reduce
pain and inflammation in his right eye.

00:09:43.721 --> 00:09:46.357
However, the symptoms recurred.

00:09:46.424 --> 00:09:48.092
Corneal stromal abscess?

00:09:48.659 --> 00:09:52.596
It's a condition in which pus accumulates
in the middle layer of the cornea.

00:09:53.164 --> 00:09:55.833
The cornea was scratched
by something in the past,

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:01.205
and although the wound itself healed,
bacteria and fungi grew inside.

00:10:01.739 --> 00:10:06.877
Unfortunately, medication
did not reduce the inflammation.

00:10:06.944 --> 00:10:08.379
Worst-case scenario,

00:10:09.046 --> 00:10:10.281
it could lead to blindness.

00:10:11.282 --> 00:10:12.149
Blindness?

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.086
When the unseating happened
at last year's Tenno Sho,

00:10:15.619 --> 00:10:19.623
a chunk of dirt might have been
kicked up by the horse in front

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:23.094
and hit Family's right eye.

00:10:24.528 --> 00:10:26.564
If only I had noticed then…

00:10:27.765 --> 00:10:28.833
I'm sorry.

00:10:28.899 --> 00:10:30.367
Please raise your head.

00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:32.436
It's no one's fault.

00:10:33.304 --> 00:10:35.439
The question is whether it can be cured.

00:10:37.007 --> 00:10:38.342
Is there a way?

00:10:38.409 --> 00:10:41.879
First, surgical removal
of the abscess is necessary,

00:10:41.946 --> 00:10:45.483
as soon as possible, to relieve the pain.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.286
However, the risk of blindness
remains the same.

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.458
Is there not any other way?

00:10:54.525 --> 00:10:57.394
There is a method
called a "Corneal Transplant,"

00:10:57.461 --> 00:11:02.433
but no veterinarians in Japan
can perform the surgery.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:03.934
No one?

00:11:04.769 --> 00:11:08.773
Japan's medical technology for racehorses
is cutting-edge even by global standards.

00:11:09.473 --> 00:11:13.410
Unfortunately,
ophthalmology is lagging behind.

00:11:14.278 --> 00:11:17.314
Even if he loses an eye,
he can still race.

00:11:17.381 --> 00:11:20.117
There are actually racehorses like that.

00:11:20.684 --> 00:11:21.619
However…

00:11:22.186 --> 00:11:22.953
However?

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.690
It is extremely difficult for a horse
that has lost its right eye

00:11:26.757 --> 00:11:29.426
to race properly on a clockwise racetrack.

00:11:30.961 --> 00:11:33.664
In other words, the Arima Kinen…

00:11:34.598 --> 00:11:38.569
I think it will be difficult
for Family to win it.

00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:42.606
Excuse me.

00:11:43.774 --> 00:11:46.076
He’s at risk of losing sight in one eye.

00:11:46.143 --> 00:11:49.213
Racing is not the best option.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.114
Excuse me.

00:11:50.181 --> 00:11:52.316
It's not for me to say, but…

00:11:53.784 --> 00:11:55.019
At this point,

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.122
you should also consider retiring him.

00:12:00.224 --> 00:12:01.258
Retiring?

00:12:02.993 --> 00:12:04.628
If we force him to enter a race,

00:12:05.196 --> 00:12:09.366
worst-case scenario,
it may cause irreparable damage.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.403
If that happens, forget retiring…

00:12:15.606 --> 00:12:18.609
That's our first problem.

00:12:20.277 --> 00:12:21.812
The other one is…

00:12:34.925 --> 00:12:37.027
Everyone in the stables is worried.

00:12:38.696 --> 00:12:41.065
Is your foot bothering you?

00:12:46.136 --> 00:12:48.172
The doctor said there's nothing wrong.

00:12:48.239 --> 00:12:50.474
The trainer is also keeping
a close eye on you, right?

00:12:51.208 --> 00:12:54.345
You're not getting results now
because you're in an adjustment period.

00:12:54.912 --> 00:12:55.746
No need to rush.

00:12:57.648 --> 00:12:58.582
I am rushing.

00:13:00.351 --> 00:13:02.653
I might not be able
to get my leg back to how it was.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.421
That's not going to happen.

00:13:04.955 --> 00:13:05.923
You're riding, right?

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:07.625
It's not enough to just ride it.

00:13:08.726 --> 00:13:10.728
There's no point if we don't win, right?

00:13:12.129 --> 00:13:13.430
Ever since I came back,

00:13:14.265 --> 00:13:16.734
I haven't placed once.

00:13:18.168 --> 00:13:19.236
Shohei…

00:13:21.906 --> 00:13:22.940
Sorry.

00:13:25.542 --> 00:13:27.177
I heard from Mr. Hironaka.

00:13:28.712 --> 00:13:31.448
It's my fault that Family got injured.

00:13:32.449 --> 00:13:34.118
Don't take it all on yourself.

00:13:35.319 --> 00:13:37.388
Even if Family makes a comeback,

00:13:38.989 --> 00:13:40.691
if I don't get back to normal…

00:13:51.035 --> 00:13:53.938
It seems like he's tormenting himself
more than I thought.

00:13:55.372 --> 00:13:56.674
I'm sorry.

00:14:00.577 --> 00:14:01.512
If…

00:14:03.113 --> 00:14:04.214
this continues…

00:14:05.649 --> 00:14:08.185
If Shohei's condition doesn't improve,

00:14:09.553 --> 00:14:10.621
when the time comes…

00:14:14.525 --> 00:14:16.694
We'll change jockeys.

00:14:24.568 --> 00:14:25.536
Mr. Kurisu.

00:14:26.337 --> 00:14:27.171
Yes?

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.809
What do you think

00:14:34.645 --> 00:14:36.213
is a horse's happiness?

00:14:39.717 --> 00:14:44.054
There are horses that can race
despite losing their right eye.

00:14:44.121 --> 00:14:45.222
That's a fact.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.225
Racehorses are creatures that run.

00:14:48.292 --> 00:14:49.426
But Family…

00:14:52.062 --> 00:14:54.098
Would he still be happy?

00:14:58.168 --> 00:15:00.104
Thank you for waiting.

00:15:04.508 --> 00:15:06.276
Like what Mr. Hironaka said,

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.517
maybe we should
think about retiring Family.

00:15:13.584 --> 00:15:15.352
-Koichi…
-But…

00:15:18.355 --> 00:15:19.857
I've said this before.

00:15:21.392 --> 00:15:22.826
At the very least,

00:15:23.327 --> 00:15:26.897
I want to earn enough prize money
to let Family live comfortably

00:15:26.964 --> 00:15:28.832
for the rest of his life.

00:15:30.567 --> 00:15:33.904
That's what I think of
when I think about a horse's happiness.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.942
But then again,
he can't earn it unless he runs.

00:15:40.077 --> 00:15:41.945
Family needs to run.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:47.484
I wonder…

00:15:51.655 --> 00:15:53.490
if this is just human ego.

00:15:55.559 --> 00:15:58.328
Am I just making him play into my ego?

00:16:04.134 --> 00:16:06.503
A monstrous surge from So Perfect!

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.305
So Perfect takes the lead!

00:16:08.372 --> 00:16:09.440
It's So Perfect!

00:16:09.506 --> 00:16:12.643
So Perfect is in the lead
and takes first place!

00:16:12.709 --> 00:16:14.078
The first Classic Race!

00:16:14.144 --> 00:16:16.814
Rider Christophe Lemaire and So Perfect!

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.084
-Thank you.
-They dominated the Satsuki Sho!

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.586
The monster bred at Hokuryo Farm!

00:16:22.653 --> 00:16:25.456
A strong start on his path
toward the Triple Crown!

00:16:25.522 --> 00:16:26.890
SO PERFECT
AIMING FOR TRIPLE CROWN

00:16:28.792 --> 00:16:31.728
IS ROYAL FAMILY HOPELESS THIS SEASON?

00:16:33.263 --> 00:16:34.198
I did it!

00:16:35.666 --> 00:16:37.634
I found a vet
who can do a corneal transplant.

00:16:37.701 --> 00:16:38.602
What?

00:16:38.669 --> 00:16:41.438
After asking around, I finally found them.

00:16:41.505 --> 00:16:42.773
Where are they?

00:16:43.841 --> 00:16:44.942
In France.

00:16:47.044 --> 00:16:49.947
She's Japanese, okay? She was from Ritto.

00:16:50.013 --> 00:16:52.916
She's currently researching veterinary
medicine at a university in France.

00:16:53.517 --> 00:16:55.052
That sounds fishy.

00:16:55.119 --> 00:16:57.888
The information was from Trainer Ogino.

00:16:57.955 --> 00:17:00.290
She's treated a horse that ran
in The Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.

00:17:00.357 --> 00:17:01.225
But…

00:17:01.792 --> 00:17:04.127
Family is also recovering from a fracture.

00:17:04.628 --> 00:17:09.166
-Sending him to France is a little bit…
-Right? So…

00:17:09.233 --> 00:17:11.935
Negotiate with the veterinarian
to return temporarily.

00:17:12.002 --> 00:17:14.037
You say it like it's easy.

00:17:14.605 --> 00:17:16.840
It's not guaranteed to be successful.

00:17:21.545 --> 00:17:23.480
About our talk the other day,

00:17:24.915 --> 00:17:29.186
I worried about
a similar thing in the past.

00:17:31.155 --> 00:17:34.525
But the President,
whom I'd just met, asked me this,

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:41.298
"Do you think a horse knows
that it has won?"

00:17:41.932 --> 00:17:43.534
I think they do.

00:17:44.401 --> 00:17:45.903
When no one is running ahead,

00:17:46.503 --> 00:17:48.839
and when no one has crossed
the finish line yet,

00:17:48.906 --> 00:17:50.974
you'll be the first to sprint through.

00:17:51.775 --> 00:17:53.944
Even horses must feel great.

00:17:55.879 --> 00:17:59.583
I want to let them experience that.

00:18:00.851 --> 00:18:01.852
I…

00:18:03.287 --> 00:18:05.289
I want to believe his words.

00:18:05.355 --> 00:18:09.193
I want Family to experience that too.

00:18:10.561 --> 00:18:14.298
We can't decide
Family's happiness for him,

00:18:15.732 --> 00:18:18.435
but we can think about it until the end.

00:18:20.237 --> 00:18:21.071
So…

00:18:22.839 --> 00:18:23.740
Don't give up.

00:18:25.142 --> 00:18:26.376
Let's do our best.

00:18:34.718 --> 00:18:35.786
I've decided.

00:18:40.691 --> 00:18:43.093
Mr. Kurisu, I've decided.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:43.994
What?

00:18:44.494 --> 00:18:46.196
We'll aim for the Arima with Family.

00:18:48.165 --> 00:18:51.735
If Family gets injured again,

00:18:54.071 --> 00:18:56.406
I'll drop out too.

00:18:58.375 --> 00:19:02.112
If that happens,
could you think about it with me?

00:19:03.981 --> 00:19:05.249
About the future.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.819
About a way to live with Family.

00:19:10.721 --> 00:19:14.992
As long as he's alive,
we can think up a new dream.

00:19:20.397 --> 00:19:22.065
It's a perfect decision.

00:19:22.132 --> 00:19:23.367
Another thing.

00:19:24.635 --> 00:19:26.169
About Shohei…

00:19:28.772 --> 00:19:30.841
I don't want anyone other than him.

00:19:33.577 --> 00:19:35.445
I think Family winning the Arima

00:19:35.512 --> 00:19:40.150
would be a way to repay everyone
who has been involved with Royal.

00:19:41.184 --> 00:19:43.687
I can't imagine Shohei not being there.

00:19:46.189 --> 00:19:48.025
We won't be replacing him.

00:19:58.135 --> 00:19:59.403
Understood.

00:20:10.514 --> 00:20:14.117
CHERBOURG UNIVERSITY
DEPARTMENT OF VETERINARY MEDICINE

00:20:15.218 --> 00:20:17.087
It should be here, right?

00:20:17.154 --> 00:20:20.324
I have an appointment
with Ms. Yuki Sawatari.

00:20:20.957 --> 00:20:21.792
What was that?

00:20:22.359 --> 00:20:23.493
Me?

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.296
Oh, me? I'm Koichi Nakajo.

00:20:26.363 --> 00:20:28.732
Koichi Nakajo. I'm Japanese.

00:20:28.799 --> 00:20:31.435
I don't really understand, but wait here.

00:20:31.501 --> 00:20:33.637
-No. Wait… What?
-Someone will come help you.

00:20:34.971 --> 00:20:38.709
This is hard. Did he understand me?

00:20:40.677 --> 00:20:42.946
Oh, what is it again?

00:20:43.814 --> 00:20:45.482
Ms. Yuki Sawatari.

00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:47.351
It's okay. You can speak in Japanese.

00:20:47.417 --> 00:20:49.019
I'm Sawatari. Come with me.

00:20:51.121 --> 00:20:52.556
Thank goodness.

00:20:57.561 --> 00:20:58.562
Excuse me.

00:20:58.628 --> 00:21:01.331
I declined via email, didn't I?

00:21:01.398 --> 00:21:02.999
Can you at least watch the video?

00:21:03.066 --> 00:21:06.269
This year will define this horse’s career.
His name is Royal Family.

00:21:06.803 --> 00:21:08.038
-Royal?
-Yes.

00:21:08.105 --> 00:21:12.876
Royal? Do you mean Kozo Sanno's Royal?

00:21:13.744 --> 00:21:15.212
Yes, that's right.

00:21:15.278 --> 00:21:17.881
-Do you know him?
-Of course.

00:21:18.482 --> 00:21:20.717
That anachronistic Showa-era dad.

00:21:22.119 --> 00:21:27.724
He yelled at me in an outraged tone
at the training center’s clinic once.

00:21:28.759 --> 00:21:32.295
He said,
"You think it's okay just to fix it?"

00:21:33.797 --> 00:21:36.032
Isn't that obvious?

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:42.105
A horse from there, huh?

00:21:44.207 --> 00:21:45.175
Yes.

00:21:57.687 --> 00:21:59.790
It's time for training, Shohei.

00:22:02.459 --> 00:22:04.995
I don't want to cause
any more trouble for the team.

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:09.266
So what are you going to do here?

00:22:11.835 --> 00:22:14.671
Hey, do you want to quit being
Family's jockey?

00:22:20.944 --> 00:22:23.113
No one thinks it's a nuisance.

00:22:24.381 --> 00:22:27.317
You're a pro, right?
The jockey shouldn't run from the horse!

00:22:28.985 --> 00:22:31.788
Don't act like you're superior
when you're not a jockey!

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:34.558
I told you, right?

00:22:34.624 --> 00:22:37.894
It's not enough to just ride it.
There's no other option but to win.

00:22:38.562 --> 00:22:40.764
That's the kind of horse he is, right?

00:22:41.665 --> 00:22:43.700
This horse is our last chance.

00:22:43.767 --> 00:22:47.804
If Family doesn't win because of me…

00:22:49.573 --> 00:22:51.541
The future of our ranch, too…

00:22:52.542 --> 00:22:54.578
If Family loses, that's it.

00:22:55.645 --> 00:22:57.981
The ranch will go under.

00:22:59.216 --> 00:23:01.184
The place my grandfather
and mother protected.

00:23:01.985 --> 00:23:03.420
It'll be my fault.

00:23:05.255 --> 00:23:06.223
If that happens,

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:09.593
is there anything you can do?

00:23:12.229 --> 00:23:13.964
It's not that I don't want to ride.

00:23:14.831 --> 00:23:15.966
I…

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.135
I'm saying that I can't ride!

00:23:23.607 --> 00:23:25.575
Wait, Shohei.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:30.280
Are you riding Family for someone else?

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.316
Did you become a jockey for someone else?

00:23:42.292 --> 00:23:44.060
KANAKO NOZAKI

00:23:55.739 --> 00:23:58.642
I am applying to the Horseracing School.

00:23:59.342 --> 00:24:01.278
I want to be Hope's jockey.

00:24:03.346 --> 00:24:05.515
MY DREAM FOR THE FUTURE
JOCKEY - SHOHEI NOZAKI

00:24:12.055 --> 00:24:13.056
Do your best!

00:24:13.123 --> 00:24:14.491
Do your best!

00:24:15.091 --> 00:24:16.927
Do your best!

00:24:36.112 --> 00:24:37.547
Come on.

00:24:38.715 --> 00:24:41.351
The horse is injured,
and your son is injured too.

00:24:41.418 --> 00:24:43.486
Hidaka's rising star, huh?

00:24:43.553 --> 00:24:44.421
It's pathetic.

00:24:45.555 --> 00:24:48.592
Breed horses and sell them,
even if the price is low!

00:24:48.658 --> 00:24:50.627
That's how a respectable ranch is run!

00:24:51.161 --> 00:24:51.995
You mock us all.

00:24:52.996 --> 00:24:55.231
There's no way
you can beat Hokuryo like that.

00:24:56.199 --> 00:24:57.601
That may be true.

00:24:59.402 --> 00:25:00.236
But…

00:25:02.739 --> 00:25:04.941
I can't just give up.

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:08.311
I can't just give up…

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:15.018
Hey.

00:25:16.186 --> 00:25:17.354
Hey!

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.521
Good morning!

00:25:19.389 --> 00:25:20.690
It's "Good evening."

00:25:23.526 --> 00:25:24.628
-Sorry.
-Hey.

00:25:25.996 --> 00:25:28.098
What's making you go this far?

00:25:29.899 --> 00:25:32.369
The previous owner
has already passed away,

00:25:32.435 --> 00:25:37.207
and I don't think giving up
on treatment would be a betrayal.

00:25:38.108 --> 00:25:39.876
Yes, indeed.

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:42.379
That may be true.

00:25:45.448 --> 00:25:48.985
But I didn't spend time with my father.

00:25:50.587 --> 00:25:52.288
From the day I was born,

00:25:52.956 --> 00:25:54.624
he was a stranger.

00:25:55.859 --> 00:25:56.993
I'll do that.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.728
-Thank you.
-Over there?

00:25:58.795 --> 00:26:00.730
Yes, it is. I'll let you handle it.

00:26:11.107 --> 00:26:12.275
Good morning.

00:26:16.079 --> 00:26:17.580
Sorry about yesterday.

00:26:21.117 --> 00:26:22.385
It's embarrassing.

00:26:23.053 --> 00:26:27.257
I was trying to persuade you,
but I ended up getting lectured instead.

00:26:29.025 --> 00:26:30.894
Something that I can do…

00:26:32.495 --> 00:26:33.730
I wonder what it is.

00:26:51.247 --> 00:26:52.315
Me too.

00:26:52.982 --> 00:26:54.217
Sorry about yesterday.

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:01.458
After that,

00:27:02.192 --> 00:27:03.626
I searched for answers.

00:27:06.429 --> 00:27:08.064
When I was with my mom in Hidaka,

00:27:08.131 --> 00:27:12.368
my only friends were the horses.

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:14.904
But…

00:27:16.005 --> 00:27:17.540
Hope being there with me,

00:27:18.842 --> 00:27:21.745
made me want to ride him
in the Arima someday.

00:27:23.313 --> 00:27:24.948
I promised I would,

00:27:26.716 --> 00:27:28.551
so I've done my best in everything.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:34.958
The reason I ride Family
is not for anyone else's sake.

00:27:36.059 --> 00:27:38.428
It's because of a promise I made

00:27:40.096 --> 00:27:41.765
to Hope, Family, and myself.

00:27:44.667 --> 00:27:46.669
And yet, I forgot about that.

00:27:47.504 --> 00:27:49.506
I haven't accomplished it yet.

00:28:12.896 --> 00:28:14.631
It's going to be okay.

00:28:19.869 --> 00:28:20.870
You…

00:28:21.905 --> 00:28:23.706
Do what you have to do.

00:28:30.046 --> 00:28:33.750
It seems like he desperately wanted
to leave something behind for me.

00:28:34.317 --> 00:28:37.153
-But I kept refusing.
-Would you like another glass of wine?

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.254
Yes, thank you.

00:28:38.988 --> 00:28:40.156
Thank you.

00:28:41.925 --> 00:28:44.194
And then, my father didn't give up.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:48.932
Before he passed away, he entrusted me
with the dream of winning the Arima Kinen.

00:28:48.998 --> 00:28:50.800
Just as I imagined him.

00:28:50.867 --> 00:28:54.204
-He's self-centered.
-Right?

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:55.972
I wouldn't want anything to do with him.

00:28:56.606 --> 00:28:58.007
I thought so too.

00:28:58.074 --> 00:28:59.909
He appeared out of the blue, saying,

00:29:00.476 --> 00:29:02.712
"Accept this money." "Inherit."

00:29:02.779 --> 00:29:04.280
-He's strange.
-He is.

00:29:09.886 --> 00:29:10.887
But…

00:29:11.588 --> 00:29:13.356
My father also told me,

00:29:15.191 --> 00:29:18.428
"You know horses better than me."

00:29:20.496 --> 00:29:22.866
A father I had never met told me,

00:29:24.033 --> 00:29:25.935
"I'm sure you can do it."

00:29:32.942 --> 00:29:34.444
Oh, I see.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:43.119
Maybe I just want
to cling to that thought.

00:29:45.054 --> 00:29:49.092
If I could fulfill my father's dream
of winning the Arima Kinen,

00:29:50.293 --> 00:29:55.098
maybe it would give meaning to my birth.

00:30:00.203 --> 00:30:02.305
You are you.

00:30:03.206 --> 00:30:06.142
There is meaning in being born.

00:30:06.209 --> 00:30:09.946
But I want to say it proudly.

00:30:11.314 --> 00:30:13.149
That I was his son.

00:30:14.317 --> 00:30:16.586
That the same blood runs in my veins.

00:30:18.454 --> 00:30:20.556
-Excuse me.
-Thank you.

00:30:23.693 --> 00:30:24.727
Doctor.

00:30:25.428 --> 00:30:29.332
What I'm asking you to do
is not just to cure him.

00:30:30.066 --> 00:30:33.136
I want us to win.
I want you to cure him so he can win.

00:30:35.104 --> 00:30:39.208
Cure Family's right eye,
so he can win this year's Arima Kinen.

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:47.150
-You're exactly like him.
-What?

00:30:48.318 --> 00:30:49.752
Your father.

00:30:49.819 --> 00:30:51.654
I told you, right?

00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:55.725
He yelled at me,
"You think it's okay just to fix it?"

00:30:56.392 --> 00:30:59.495
I thought,
"What is this old man talking about?"

00:31:01.998 --> 00:31:05.668
After that, Mr. Sanno said,

00:31:07.136 --> 00:31:11.507
"Horses don't want to be cured.
They want to win.

00:31:12.475 --> 00:31:17.013
If you care about the horse,
don't just be satisfied with curing it."

00:31:20.483 --> 00:31:22.018
You ask for too much.

00:31:22.819 --> 00:31:24.354
You and your father.

00:31:39.135 --> 00:31:40.470
Please!

00:31:42.505 --> 00:31:43.873
I just can't figure it out.

00:31:44.574 --> 00:31:46.542
How can I get back to my old self?

00:31:47.243 --> 00:31:50.880
I fully understand that I'm in no position
to ask you for advice.

00:31:53.182 --> 00:31:55.318
-It's impossible.
-What?

00:31:55.385 --> 00:31:57.487
You can’t return to the way it was.
Just give up.

00:32:02.025 --> 00:32:03.292
I will not give up!

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.229
I became a jockey to win the Arima.

00:32:06.295 --> 00:32:07.563
I will not give up!

00:32:08.998 --> 00:32:11.267
Who said anything
about giving up on winning?

00:32:13.102 --> 00:32:14.103
What?

00:32:16.806 --> 00:32:18.541
Adjust the stirrups.

00:32:18.608 --> 00:32:20.610
Forget about your old form.

00:32:21.144 --> 00:32:23.346
Find your new self.

00:32:29.752 --> 00:32:31.788
How does the stirrup feel right now?

00:32:31.854 --> 00:32:34.490
I feel like my center of gravity
shifts back and forth when running.

00:32:34.557 --> 00:32:37.393
Let's stretch them a little
and check the balance.

00:32:44.767 --> 00:32:48.204
HIDAKA TRAINING AND RESEARCH CENTER

00:32:56.212 --> 00:32:59.715
Wow! How many years has it been?

00:32:59.782 --> 00:33:00.683
This way, please.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:04.020
The cornea and medical equipment
you ordered have arrived safely

00:33:04.087 --> 00:33:06.389
from Hokkaido University's
Animal Medical Center.

00:33:06.456 --> 00:33:08.091
Are you the manager?

00:33:08.157 --> 00:33:09.192
My name is Kurisu.

00:33:10.093 --> 00:33:14.297
You're doing well putting up with
two generations of troublesome owners.

00:33:14.864 --> 00:33:15.798
I'm sorry?

00:33:16.866 --> 00:33:18.367
What an odd one.

00:33:46.562 --> 00:33:48.331
Let me have a look, okay?

00:33:57.773 --> 00:33:59.842
A lot of people believe in you.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:03.146
You must be happy.

00:34:08.451 --> 00:34:10.386
Please prepare for the surgery.

00:34:10.453 --> 00:34:11.420
Okay.

00:34:15.324 --> 00:34:16.325
Thank you very much.

00:34:16.392 --> 00:34:17.827
Thank you very much.

00:34:20.096 --> 00:34:20.963
Oh, right.

00:34:22.098 --> 00:34:24.734
I'm not the one who will make you win.

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:27.436
You guys will.

00:34:28.437 --> 00:34:30.973
I only set the stage.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:31.874
Yes.

00:34:34.043 --> 00:34:36.279
I'll leave the rest to you all.

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:39.348
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you very much.

00:34:41.017 --> 00:34:43.753
-Stay in Hokkaido?
-Yes.

00:34:43.819 --> 00:34:47.723
I was wondering if Family
could stay here at Nozaki Farm.

00:34:48.424 --> 00:34:50.993
Wouldn't it be best
to get treatment in his hometown?

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:52.595
That may be true, but…

00:34:53.262 --> 00:34:54.497
But, Kanako.

00:34:56.065 --> 00:34:58.401
Family's treatment will take time.

00:34:59.001 --> 00:35:02.004
Isn't it difficult
to balance work and the ranch?

00:35:02.605 --> 00:35:03.439
Well…

00:35:04.473 --> 00:35:05.708
About that…

00:35:06.909 --> 00:35:09.879
When Kanako is away to check Family,

00:35:09.946 --> 00:35:12.215
we'll have the young ones help out here.

00:35:12.281 --> 00:35:13.416
Right? Let's do that.

00:35:13.482 --> 00:35:14.317
Mr. Hikawa, you…

00:35:14.383 --> 00:35:17.453
They are ranch owners
who volunteered for Family.

00:35:19.088 --> 00:35:20.189
Everyone!

00:35:20.256 --> 00:35:22.058
I've brought Royal Family's owner.

00:35:22.124 --> 00:35:22.959
Koichi.

00:35:23.025 --> 00:35:24.060
Oh, my!

00:35:24.126 --> 00:35:25.861
Here he comes!

00:35:25.928 --> 00:35:27.263
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:30.399
We'll provide
a horse trailer to the clinic.

00:35:30.466 --> 00:35:32.768
Leave the manual labor to the young guys.

00:35:32.835 --> 00:35:34.003
-Right?
-Yes.

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:37.473
Until Family can move
to the training farm,

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:40.977
they said they want to help out
with the treatments and ranch chores.

00:35:41.043 --> 00:35:41.911
Sorry.

00:35:41.978 --> 00:35:44.580
If only my body could move a little more.

00:35:44.647 --> 00:35:46.949
What are you talking about? It's okay.

00:35:47.016 --> 00:35:47.850
Yes, it is.

00:35:47.917 --> 00:35:49.318
-Right?
-Yes.

00:35:49.385 --> 00:35:52.088
Hidaka is not only yours.

00:35:57.059 --> 00:35:58.995
We live here.

00:36:00.029 --> 00:36:02.331
Let us fight too. Together.

00:36:03.232 --> 00:36:05.034
Oh, well.

00:36:06.669 --> 00:36:08.304
We have no choice but to do it, huh?

00:36:09.171 --> 00:36:10.239
Let's do it.

00:36:10.973 --> 00:36:11.907
Everyone!

00:36:12.475 --> 00:36:15.845
Let's definitely help Family
make his comeback.

00:36:16.545 --> 00:36:18.247
Yes!

00:36:18.314 --> 00:36:21.117
Koichi, it's a pleasure to work with you!

00:36:24.053 --> 00:36:25.454
Please, come in!

00:36:26.555 --> 00:36:28.891
By the way, Shohei…

00:36:29.392 --> 00:36:30.226
What?

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.162
He was written
as Hidaka's rising star, right?

00:36:33.229 --> 00:36:35.264
-By Mr. Taira?
-Yes.

00:36:35.898 --> 00:36:38.367
Apparently, he doesn't like it.

00:36:38.434 --> 00:36:39.268
What?

00:36:39.335 --> 00:36:41.504
He said, "It's like a horse name."

00:36:42.772 --> 00:36:43.739
I see.

00:36:43.806 --> 00:36:47.243
-"Nozaki Farm Produced, Star of Hidaka."
-"Star of Hidaka."

00:36:49.378 --> 00:36:51.347
"In first place is Star of Hidaka.

00:36:51.414 --> 00:36:53.849
Star of Hidaka won the Arima!"

00:36:53.916 --> 00:36:56.085
-See? I told you.
-You're right.

00:37:18.574 --> 00:37:21.777
A few centimeters of stirrup adjustment
makes that much of a difference?

00:37:21.844 --> 00:37:24.547
He's still getting the hang of it, though.

00:37:24.613 --> 00:37:27.817
Changing his mindset
was a big step forward for him.

00:37:37.026 --> 00:37:38.027
Oh, Family!

00:37:38.794 --> 00:37:39.895
Can you see me?

00:37:41.564 --> 00:37:44.100
That's good. Oh, yes, you can see me!

00:37:45.401 --> 00:37:47.937
Look. It's coming
more naturally to you now.

00:37:48.003 --> 00:37:49.038
Thank you very much.

00:37:49.105 --> 00:37:50.873
You're looking great.

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.074
Oh, you're looking good!

00:37:53.409 --> 00:37:56.579
Approximately seven months
after the unseating at the Tenno Sho,

00:37:56.645 --> 00:37:59.081
Royal Family and Shohei Nozaki

00:37:59.148 --> 00:38:04.120
held their first test
to get back on the race track.

00:38:07.289 --> 00:38:08.124
What?

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:09.725
Doesn’t he look a bit bigger?

00:38:09.792 --> 00:38:12.261
I went all out spoiling him.

00:38:13.562 --> 00:38:16.465
After everyone in Hidaka
pampered him a lot,

00:38:16.999 --> 00:38:18.834
he somehow grew bigger.

00:38:20.202 --> 00:38:21.937
Is that even possible?

00:38:22.738 --> 00:38:24.039
I think so.

00:38:32.281 --> 00:38:33.449
We'll set off now.

00:38:34.116 --> 00:38:35.151
Got it.

00:38:36.385 --> 00:38:37.987
-Any time now.
-Okay.

00:38:47.129 --> 00:38:48.397
Let's go, Family.

00:39:40.216 --> 00:39:41.050
Here they come.

00:39:44.887 --> 00:39:45.721
All right!

00:39:49.992 --> 00:39:51.527
You can do it.

00:39:51.594 --> 00:39:52.928
You can do it.

00:39:55.698 --> 00:39:57.233
-All right!
-Yes!

00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:58.968
Yes!

00:40:00.002 --> 00:40:01.270
They did it!

00:40:14.283 --> 00:40:15.417
Mr. Hironaka.

00:40:15.484 --> 00:40:16.485
Mr. Kurisu.

00:40:17.586 --> 00:40:18.420
I'm glad.

00:40:18.487 --> 00:40:19.388
Shohei.

00:40:20.189 --> 00:40:21.490
Shohei.

00:40:23.492 --> 00:40:24.660
Shohei…

00:40:26.295 --> 00:40:27.930
Shohei!

00:40:45.314 --> 00:40:47.917
Family, you've become stronger.

00:40:48.751 --> 00:40:49.885
Me too.

00:40:50.486 --> 00:40:52.121
I’m going to get stronger.

00:41:04.333 --> 00:41:05.501
This view.

00:41:06.135 --> 00:41:08.170
I need to burn it into my memory

00:41:09.371 --> 00:41:10.973
so I can never forget it.

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.808
You don't have to do that.

00:41:12.875 --> 00:41:14.543
You can come here anytime, right?

00:41:16.645 --> 00:41:20.215
This view, this moment,
exists only right now.

00:41:28.357 --> 00:41:30.059
Should we get married?

00:41:34.396 --> 00:41:35.898
This view…

00:41:37.967 --> 00:41:40.269
Everything that will happen from now on…

00:41:43.105 --> 00:41:46.375
I realized I want to become a family
with you, and face everything

00:41:47.676 --> 00:41:48.711
together.

00:41:54.249 --> 00:41:55.184
So…

00:42:00.456 --> 00:42:01.757
I want to marry you.

00:42:06.895 --> 00:42:08.030
I told you, right?

00:42:09.164 --> 00:42:10.532
I'd make the decision.

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.748
I'd be happy to.

00:42:28.984 --> 00:42:30.586
What? I can't hear you.

00:42:33.222 --> 00:42:35.190
I'd be happy to!

00:42:36.258 --> 00:42:38.494
I'd be happy to!

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.162
Stop it already!

00:42:48.103 --> 00:42:49.738
-All right!
-Wait!

00:42:49.805 --> 00:42:51.840
-All right!
-Wait! This is embarrassing!

00:42:51.907 --> 00:42:54.109
Number 11 Hoshino Klar
is closing in from the outside!

00:42:54.176 --> 00:42:56.512
Number 13, Vials Teon,
is chasing from the inside.

00:42:56.578 --> 00:42:58.580
Number 14, So Perfect, holds the lead!

00:42:58.647 --> 00:42:59.882
He leads by a length and a half!

00:42:59.948 --> 00:43:02.685
So Perfect secures a Double Crown
with an impressive victory!

00:43:05.754 --> 00:43:08.157
-Congratulations on the Double Crown.
-Thank you.

00:43:08.223 --> 00:43:09.758
Today, you won the Japan Derby.

00:43:09.825 --> 00:43:11.927
Next is the Kikuka Sho.
How confident are you?

00:43:12.428 --> 00:43:13.929
It's the bare minimum.

00:43:14.763 --> 00:43:16.832
With a horse like that,
the Triple Crown is a given.

00:43:16.899 --> 00:43:19.368
Rather, we have to aim higher.

00:43:19.435 --> 00:43:20.269
You mean…

00:43:20.335 --> 00:43:23.739
Satsuki Sho, Derby, Kikuka Sho, and…

00:43:24.573 --> 00:43:25.574
the Arima Kinen.

00:43:26.375 --> 00:43:27.409
Mr. Aiso.

00:43:27.476 --> 00:43:29.812
How many horses
have gone undefeated and won

00:43:29.878 --> 00:43:32.147
both the Triple Crown and the Arima Kinen?

00:43:33.215 --> 00:43:36.819
-There hasn't been a single one.
-Then, we'll be the first in history!

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:42.524
As long as So Perfect is around,
we're facing strong competition.

00:43:43.826 --> 00:43:45.260
I'll ask again.

00:43:46.195 --> 00:43:48.997
Are we really aiming
for the Arima this year?

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:56.405
Just being in the race is a miracle.

00:43:56.472 --> 00:43:58.474
It takes courage to give up too.

00:43:59.174 --> 00:44:01.076
We still have next year.

00:44:01.143 --> 00:44:03.378
Are you still going to aim

00:44:04.613 --> 00:44:05.748
for this year's Arima?

00:44:11.286 --> 00:44:14.089
There's no guarantee
that next year will go well.

00:44:15.057 --> 00:44:18.794
Family is in his prime now.

00:44:23.799 --> 00:44:25.601
The dream is first place.

00:44:26.735 --> 00:44:29.805
That is our mission.

00:44:31.073 --> 00:44:31.940
It's impossible.

00:44:32.541 --> 00:44:34.777
They haven't run a single race this year.

00:44:35.744 --> 00:44:39.815
Unless he competes in major stakes races
and wins first place every time,

00:44:40.649 --> 00:44:42.317
the prize money just isn’t enough.

00:44:45.187 --> 00:44:46.188
What about fan votes?

00:44:46.255 --> 00:44:48.157
It depends on the results.

00:44:49.424 --> 00:44:53.061
Fans can't rely on a horse that can't win.

00:44:55.097 --> 00:44:56.331
It's going to be tough.

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:01.937
I mean, rather than them,
how about you worry about yourself?

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:08.944
The wave of a new generation
is closing in.

00:45:24.626 --> 00:45:26.195
Some efforts
only mean something if you win.

00:45:26.261 --> 00:45:28.030
Please watch, President.

00:45:28.096 --> 00:45:29.965
We will show them consecutive wins.

00:45:30.032 --> 00:45:32.134
Let's win and be rewarded.

00:45:32.201 --> 00:45:34.036
Now, it's time.

00:45:34.102 --> 00:45:35.003
