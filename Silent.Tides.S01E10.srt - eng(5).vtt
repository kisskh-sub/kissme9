Promissory Note]

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.550
Xian, you're really efficient.

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.650
In just one day,

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.340
you wrapped up
both the contract and the money.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.370
[Grain Purchase Contract]

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.479
I really picked the right person.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.120
In today's Macau,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.900
apart from Mr. Fu and Mr. Cui,

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.810
who else could put up
tens of millions at once?

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.420
So I went straight to them—

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.180
that saved a lot of time.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.010
However,

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.070
they have a condition.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.630
What condition?

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.790
Everyone knows the grain in Zhongshan
was seized by you, Captain Huang.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.930
If I'm the one selling it for you,

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.330
why should they trust me?

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.370
So

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.550
even though the contract is signed,

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.079
they want

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.750
a handwritten authorization from you.

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:21.950
It must state

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.290
that you've entrusted me
to sell the grain on your behalf,

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.690
at two dollars per catty.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.820
Only then will they release
the six million in cash.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.020
I see.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.540
If you don't write it,

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.790
how can they trust me?

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.560
That's true.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.210
But there's one condition—

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.960
you must never

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.500
let this authorization leak.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.070
Why?

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.920
You know how ruthless
the Imperial Army is.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.620
If they find out

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.520
I'm selling at two dollars a catty,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.490
we won't

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.750
make a dime.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.130
I understand.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.900
You can tell the Imperial Army
whatever price you want.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.030
As for this authorization—

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.250
even if it costs me my life,

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.340
I won't let it leak.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.570
That's more like it.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.340
Rong,

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.820
give me a pen and paper.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.470
What's the matter?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.400
There's one more thing.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.280
How have you arranged
the grain transport fleet?

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.250
You can rest assured about this.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.850
I've hired Datong Shipping.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.970
They're handling the permits

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.000
with the government
and the Japanese Navy

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.750
for empty ships to sail to Zhongshan.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.680
At the latest,
everything will be ready by tomorrow.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.400
Datong Shipping

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.860
is Chinese-owned.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.800
With Japanese warships

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.800
blockading the Lingding Channel,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.130
empty ships might get through.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.980
But if the return trip
is loaded with grain

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.440
and something goes wrong,

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.180
that'd be a huge problem.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.760
Doesn't Magistrate Zhao
of Zhongshan County

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.200
issue a special pass for the return trip?

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:28.330
To be safe,

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.830
I think we should
switch to another company.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.680
I called Saito from Lyun Coeng earlier.

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.860
He's

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.130
very interested in this deal.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.130
After all, Lyun Coeng
is Japanese-controlled;

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.680
it's easier to get things done
at sea.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.130
Safer that way.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.130
What do you think?

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:46.570
Captain Huang,

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.890
the fleet sails
before dawn the day after tomorrow.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.360
That leaves us just one day.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.540
Getting the full set of
transit permits in that time

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.940
won't be easy.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.000
If anything gets delayed,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.510
the losses could be huge.

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:59.980
Don't worry.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:00.940
Saito from Lyun Coeng

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.940
can handle this small matter.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.190
So it's settled.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.800
Fine.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.040
It's your business, your decision.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.540
But if any problems arise,

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.630
don't blame me.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:13.860
No problem.

this is a huge deal.

Having you run around alone

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.750
is indeed a lot of work.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.180
Just leave those trivial matters

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.010

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.030

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.980
Aren't you going to Zhongshan
tomorrow to inspect the grain?

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.000
But our fleet doesn't sail

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.010
until the day after.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.690
Someone has to escort the ships.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:02.790
Besides,

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.120
when we seized the grain in Zhongshan,

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.180
Rong was there too.

Magistrate Zhao before.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:10.980
It'll make coordination easier

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.130
later on.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.060

is it alright if he takes charge of
the transit permits?

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.060
As long as the transit permits
are completed quickly,

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.190
I have no objection.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.780
Shipping grain early?

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.680
Why the rush?

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.230
I want to get a better price.

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:01.670
I've done the math—

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.110
once the Portuguese Macau government
signs the deal,

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.440
if we're the first to bring the grain in

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.810
and sell it,

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:09.970
we can make three to four million.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:11.570
The Special Operations Team

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.850
takes twenty percent.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:15.440
The remaining eighty percent goes to you.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.190
Since the grain has to
be sold sooner or later,

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.520
there's no harm in planning ahead.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.040
But there's one thing—

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.900
the Portuguese Macau government
canceled the vote yesterday.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.660
It looks like they're going to
hold out until the deadline.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:36.690
What if

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:37.980
something goes wrong?

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:40.230
Don't worry about that.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.360
My own people are escorting the ships.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.110
They'll only enter the port
after I notify them.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.380
I guarantee not a single sack of grain

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.040
will enter Macau
before the contract is signed.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.330
That's more like it.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.760
Then handle it

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.710
yourself.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:56.490
Yes.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.300
Who exactly wants to see me?

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.360
Why so mysterious?

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.400
You'll find out when you meet them.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.090
Let's go.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:16.170
Mr. He?

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:25.610
Rice!

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:27.770
Don't fight!

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:28.790
It's mine!

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:33.190
Hey.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:34.420
Mr. Yang, what are you doing?

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:35.590
Wait, Mr. He.

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:38.010
It's Brother Xian.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.210
It was all my fault before.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.540
Brother Xian, you repaid evil with kindness
and saved my life.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:45.560
I'll never forget

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.720
your life-saving grace.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:52.800
Please get up.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.380
Come on.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.070
Brother Xian, if you need anything
in the future,

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:00.000
just let me know.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.930
The transit permit is all set.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.780
Secretary He, you're truly efficient.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.660
I should be thanking you
for the opportunity.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.040
Then I'll prepare the shipping order.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:12.560
Okay.

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:17.180
Here,

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:18.590
this is the deposit.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:20.680
And this too.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:22.940
What's this?

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.800
You like to hedge your bets, Xian?

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.560
Isn't Hou Heng owned by Mr. Fu?

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.970
When I signed the contract with him,

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:29.060
he gave this to me

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.750
and told me to go play a bit.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.400
But I'm so busy now.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.440
I don't have time.

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:34.310
You helped

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:35.990
a lot

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:37.190
with the transit permit today,

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:39.290
so I'll pass it on to you.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:40.230
No,

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:41.030
Brother Xian,

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.580
I never gamble.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.330
Oh, I see.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.160
Hey,

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:50.640
how about

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.180
giving it to me?

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:53.330
Huh?

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.310
Rong,

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.070
It's not that
I don't want to give it to you.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.420
Captain Huang said

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.090
we can't be careless with this job.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:04.290
You can't go gambling before it's done.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:04.850
Come on,

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:06.260
I didn't say I'd go today.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
Can't I go another day?

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:10.940
Thanks.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.420
Rong,

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.420
you're in charge of escorting the ships.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.330
Keep all of these safe.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.060
Alright.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.090
Are we done?

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.900
If we're done, let's go.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:25.700
Don't dawdle.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.440
Secretary He has been such a great help.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.280
I should at least treat him to a meal.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:29.990
No need,

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.850
don't be so polite, Brother Xian.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:32.230
I must treat you to this meal.

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:34.690
If you don't come,
you're not giving me face.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:37.190
Rong, come with us.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:38.900
You two go ahead.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.020
I won't disturb you. I'm leaving.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.270
[Hou Heng]

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.800
[Hou Heng]

00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:02.060
[Hou Heng]

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.900
These past few days
have really opened my eyes.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:07.590
Now I understand what they mean by

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:08.920
"the young are to be feared."

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.760
Not at all.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.660
I should thank you for your support.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:13.690
This time, it's all thanks to you

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:14.920
for bringing such a big business deal

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.710
and recommending me to the Chairman.

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:18.310
Otherwise, I wouldn't have
had the chance to prove myself.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:19.400
So your ability to learn two languages

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.680
in just one month,

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.590
and memorize Macau's commercial laws

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:23.940
backwards and forwards—

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.140
was that my doing too?

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:26.620
All right.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.230
Let's skip the flattery.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.040
Secretary He, I toast you with tea

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.070
to congratulate you on your promotion.

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:33.800
You don't need to call me
Secretary He anymore.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.060
Just call me Hongshen.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.330
In that case,
I won't stand on ceremony—

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:37.940
Hongshen.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.100
Cheers.

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:51.190
Small. Small. Small.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.640
Open it!

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.800
-Big! Big!
-Open it!

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.050
Big! Big!

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:04.450
Well, look who it is,

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:05.640
Officer Yang.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.400
You're doing pretty well, huh?

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.090
Huh?

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.560
Are you surprised to see I'm still alive?

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.550
Surprised?

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.900
Disappointed?

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.250
Excuse me,

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.270
I'm too tough to die.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.830
I haven't been killed by you traitors yet.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:23.690
How about that?

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.170
What do you mean by this?

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:28.830
Are you looking for trouble?

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:30.690
Yes, I'm here to give you trouble.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.090
Got a problem with that?

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.610
You made me take the fall
and rot in prison.

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.010
It almost cost me my life.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.560
We need to settle the score.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.760
Fine.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.810
-Open it!
-Open it!

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:46.520
Yes.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.140
14 points. Big.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.540
Great!

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.230
Bleed him dry!

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.410
Bankrupt this bastard!

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.470
Alright!

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.860
Yang,

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:00.940
I used to call you Officer Yang

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.760
because of your fancy police uniform.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.220
You really think you're something special?

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:08.900
Can't take a loss?

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.590
If you can't take it, get the hell out.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.930
I can't take it?

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:22.440
One-on-one?

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:26.760
Fine.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.920
One-on-one!

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.920
Whoever loses

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.170
crawls out of here!

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:40.280
Han,

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.320
take good care of
our two distinguished guests.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:53.510
I really didn't expect

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.680
the transit permit
to be this troublesome.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.660
You know the process so well,

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.260
yet it still took a whole day.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.920
If the transit permit were lost,

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.490
wouldn't my business be finished?

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:02.830
Not necessarily.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:04.010
The paperwork can be reissued—

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:05.940
it would just take some extra time.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:07.380
How long?

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:09.290
Since all the originals are on file,

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.140
it'll be faster than the first time,

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.900
but still at least an hour or two.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.210
Xian, why are you suddenly
asking about this?

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:20.470
You just got your permits processed.

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.599
It couldn't possibly get lost, right?

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:24.010
You don't know—

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.020
I'm really not at ease about

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.510
the guy who came with me.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.580
What's wrong with him?

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.380
Do you know what his nickname is?

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:31.790
Gambler Rong.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.120
No wonder he never puts the dice down.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.600
The moment he sees chips,
his eyes light up.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.710
So he's a gambling addict.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:37.900
And it's not just gambling—

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.300
he's a heavy drinker too.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:42.450
Normally I'd keep my distance
from someone like that.

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:44.940
But this job is backed by Huang Gongjie.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.710
He specifically assigned Gambler Rong
to escort the ships.

You've just established yourself
at Lyun Coeng,

and now you're handling such a big deal.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.600
You must be careful in everything you do.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.010

from me.

But my brother Yang's gambling stake

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.740
is payment for goods
from our Tai Ho Brotherhood.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.680
Today, I've come here

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.180

who cares about a few thousand pataca?

to the Tai Ho Brotherhood.

the brotherhood again.

he was misled by Huang Gongjie after all.

Making him a scapegoat now

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:19.100
is already letting him off easy.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.090
But that young man from Lyun Coeng,

can he be trusted?

He's just been promoted to secretary.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.820

The granary is this way.

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:42.680
Please.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.610
Thank you for your trouble.

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:46.600
You know who I am.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.620
Do I really need those papers to sail?

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:50.430
I'm sorry,

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:51.920
but these are company rules.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.290
I'm responsible for this shipment,

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:54.960
and I won't let the ship sail
without proper documentation.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.030
So what do I

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:56.770
do now?

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.870
You'll need to get
complete replacement documents.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:00.700
Replacement?

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.690
How long will that take?

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.190
Government offices
don't open until 8 o'clock.

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:06.690
Even if I send someone to wait at the door

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:08.030
to process the paperwork immediately,

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:09.490
it'll still be after 9:30.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.050
Magistrate Zhao,
I've finished counting the goods.

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:17.450
The quantity is correct.

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:18.600
Here's the payment.

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:21.050
Quickly distribute it
to those grain merchants,

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:22.920
so they'll stop protesting
at the county office every day.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:23.340
Got it.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.160
County Magistrate!

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.610
Lyun Coeng's grain fleet
has arrived at the pier.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.210
Magistrate Zhao,
the paperwork is in order, right?

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:43.030
Well,

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:45.490
how could Lyun Coeng's team
have any problems?

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:47.420
Mr. He, you're being too cautious.

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:49.280
Better safe than sorry.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.660
Well then,

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:53.150
let's load the ships.

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:56.160
Brothers!

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:58.210
Start loading!

00:28:58.210 --> 00:28:58.990
Yes!

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:07.880
Mr. He, you're being too formal.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:11.080
Magistrate Zhao, you've been so helpful.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.920
A small token of appreciation
is only right.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.360
Then I won't be polite.

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:15.910
Thank you. Thank you.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:20.290
Come in.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:23.710
Magistrate Zhao.

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:24.520
Mr. He.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:26.250
The cargo has almost been loaded.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:27.160
In about 15 minutes,

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.420
we'll be ready to sail.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:29.290
Alright.

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:31.690
I'll issue you a transit permit
right away.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:32.840
Magistrate Zhao,

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:34.160
regarding the transit permit,

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.490
we might need to trouble you

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:36.230
to make it

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:38.690
to be applicable
for the Modaomen Waterway.

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:40.900
If the real and decoy fleets meet head-on

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.430
during the return journey,

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.290
the deception will be exposed immediately.

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:45.160
At worst,

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.270
we can block the Hengmen Waterway.

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:48.900
The Lyun Coeng fleet must navigate

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.000
[Hengmen Waterway]

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.750
[February 18, 1942] [11:00]

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:53.750
the Hengmen Waterway to enter here.

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.250
Why so slow?

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:57.190
Hurry!

00:29:58.060 --> 00:29:58.470
You,

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:00.150
go faster.

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:01.520
I can't go any faster.

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.240
The ship is at maximum speed.

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:06.330
Faster!

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.900
As long as the engine doesn't explode,

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.830
push it to the limit! Do you hear me?

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:13.870
Raise the sails!

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:24.030
The Tai Ho Brotherhood
has lived on these waters for centuries.

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:26.620
Blocking the waterway
is no big deal for us.

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:28.790
Brothers!

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:30.530
Let's get to work!

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:37.690
Once we block the Hengmen Waterway,

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:39.160
on our return journey,

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.750
we'll have a reason

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:43.210
to navigate the Modaomen Waterway instead.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:46.990
Modaomen?

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.440
Why?

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.230
Well,

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:51.320
I just heard from ships
coming from Hengmen

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.340
that the river

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:53.580
has been completely blocked

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:55.550
by bamboo rafts.

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:57.640
I'm afraid it won't be cleared today.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.640
So we have to navigate
the Modaomen Waterway instead.

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.640
Navigating the Modaomen Waterway

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.240
will cost a two-hour detour.

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:05.930
We have no choice.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:07.450
Taking this detour

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:09.200
will burn a lot more coal.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.490
How unlucky.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:15.530
Magistrate Zhao,

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:17.450
we'll have to trouble you to make

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:20.430
the transit permit to be applicable
for the Modaomen Waterway.

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:22.380
Well, don't worry yet.

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:25.340
I'll call the Hengmen checkpoint

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:28.160
to see if it's really that badly blocked.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.620
If it's truly serious,

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:30.450
then

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:32.080
I'll have to ask you both

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.530
to detour through the Modaomen Waterway,

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:34.210
alright?

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:36.000
Thank you for your trouble.

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:46.580
Hello?

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.880
Is this the Hengmen checkpoint?

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.120
This is Zhao Dinghua.

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:53.550
I heard the Hengmen Waterway
has been blocked.

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:54.660
Is it serious?

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:10.250
Oh, I see.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.120
How long will it take?

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:13.450
All right.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.700
Notify me as soon as it's cleared.

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:20.320
The Hengmen checkpoint
has indeed been blocked.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.450
It's quite serious.

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.420
But you two gentlemen

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:24.900
are really lucky.

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:28.230
A Japanese warship needs to pass through.

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:30.290
This big Japanese warship
has powerful engines

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:31.250
and strong firepower.

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:33.030
They're in a hurry to pass through,

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:35.160
so they're clearing the waterway now.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.190
Such good luck.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.770
We really should thank the Imperial Army.

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.540
How long will it take?

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:42.820
They said

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:44.050
it shouldn't take long.

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:44.750
Once there's any news,

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:46.080
they'll notify me immediately.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.620
Gentlemen, please be patient.

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:48.920
I'll make you some tea.

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:50.620
Thank you very much.

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:02.980
Master Huang.

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.170
Why is it taking so long?

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.680
I hope nothing's gone wrong.

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:23.860
Magistrate Zhao.

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.320
Is the waterway clearance

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:26.190
reliable?

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:27.620
As you know,

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:29.290
this shipment must arrive

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:30.580
in Macau before 6 o'clock.

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.080
I think we'd better navigate
the Modaomen Waterway instead

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.210
to avoid any delay.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:36.820
Alright, I'll call to check the situation.

Are you sure?

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:46.510
Good. Good.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:47.750
Alright.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.980
Mr. He, that was a call
from the Hengmen checkpoint.

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.210
They said that with the current progress,

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:56.160
the waterway will be clear
in half an hour at most.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.320
Look, it'll take you at least

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.660
an hour or two
to reach the Hengmen checkpoint.

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:00.450
Now,

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:02.680
you don't need to take a detour.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:03.690
That's great.

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.290
In that case,

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:06.660
we'll still navigate the Hengmen Waterway.

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:08.659
Please issue us the transit permit.

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:09.389

Mr. He.

for navigating the Hengmen Waterway?

It's already past noon.

The Modaomen Waterway is far away.

If we don't leave now,

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.880

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:37.490
Why has this transit permit

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:38.600
been altered?

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.950
Oh, I see.

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:44.380
We planned to navigate
the Hengmen Waterway,

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:45.510
but there was an accident

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:46.740
on the river surface there,

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.470
so Magistrate Zhao modified our permit

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:50.930
to navigate the Modaomen Waterway instead.

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:56.030
Magistrate Zhao?

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.060
Everyone on alert!

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.240
Colonel Sawa.

00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:12.700
We should call De Solaire

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:15.150
and lower some of our demands.

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:18.380
The blockade will only last until tonight.

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:19.510
When the time comes,

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:22.750
both the Navy and the Army
will withdraw completely.

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:24.150
If this drags on,

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:26.590
your plan will completely fail.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.700
Only half an hour is left until 6 o'clock.

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:35.650
Actually, 34 minutes.

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:37.780
You...

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:54.340
Didn't you say
the grain fleet had arrived?

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:55.400
Where are the ships?

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.730
I'm sorry, Your Excellency the Governor.

00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:58.730
I lied.

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:00.590
What did you say?

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.150
Lok Pak, it's such an important matter.

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:04.470
How dare you!

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:06.240
Because no matter what,

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.700
we must hold our bottom line.

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:10.130
Macau can't sign that agreement!

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:11.510
Say no more!

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:12.800
We must hurry!

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:21.450
Hello?

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:23.260
Magistrate Zhao.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.060
There's something

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:27.950
I need you to personally verify.

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:30.520
Did you modify the transit permit?

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:37.310
Yes, I did.

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:39.880
Because we ran out of blank ones,

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.650
I modified an existing one.

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:43.570
I understand.

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:54.750
Thank you for your cooperation,
Magistrate Zhao.

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:55.600
[County Magistrate Zhao Dinghua,
Zhongshan County Government]

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:56.190
[Transit Permit]

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:26.300
Hello?

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:28.540
Governor De Solaire?

00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:31.990
Governor De Solaire.

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.950
I'm very sorry.

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:35.570
Due to some unexpected incidents,

00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:37.990
we've delayed the signing time
with your side.

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:40.300
I hope you can forgive us.

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:43.840
As long as Your Excellency the Governor
comes to sign quickly,

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:46.800
the Empire of Japan
can overlook what happened.

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.470
Flag signal report.

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:57.000
The grain has arrived!

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:58.240
Macau has grain now!

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:01.040
Macau has grain now!

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:04.720
Hello?

00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:06.810
Governor De Solaire?

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:08.720
Hello?

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:12.550
Colonel Sawa, Consul Fukue,

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.290
there's no need to extend
the deadline anymore.

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:16.820
I'm making this call

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:19.110
as the Governor of Macau

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:20.920
to officially inform you

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.900
that the Macau government can't accept

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:25.320
Japan's unreasonable demands.

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.760
We refuse to sign this agreement.

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.330
Everyone, be careful.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.990
Master Sanhe, Master Huang,

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:55.590
thank you for your hard work.

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:56.340
Thank you.

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:57.700
There's one more thing.

00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:58.320
Mr. He,

00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:59.780
Dr. Ke made it clear—

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:00.550
I can't let you

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:01.890
return safely to Macau like this.
