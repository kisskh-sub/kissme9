[The Vendetta of An]

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.040
Huben Army's ambush

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.210
caused Chang'an to fall.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.250
The Emperor, Xiao Wuyang, was attacked

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.830
and went missing.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.440
Yan Fengshan rules Chang'an once again.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.460
[Episode 14]

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.780
Master,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.640
is this the only way out of the city?

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.800
Yes.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.130
A few thousand people were mobilized from Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.690
They mainly focus

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.060
on the imperial court's secrets and city gates.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.320
The canal is remote

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.410
so there is still a chance.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.010
People say that Your Majesty

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.750
is kind in heart yet lacking in talent.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.000
You ascended the throne only to govern in mediocrity.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.430
You brought war back upon the land

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.840
and left the common people in misery.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.990
They also added that in the end, you had let your ancestors down

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:46.850
and perished in disgrace.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.810
But I beg to differ.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.690
I have heard that under Your Majesty's leadership,

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.090
you granted the people time to recover

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.640
and returned the troops to their barracks.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.620
You changed customs for the better

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.020
and brought prosperity to all.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.180
The elderly had someone to rely on

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.590
and the children had someone to raise them.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.320
Though your reign

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.130
lacked both the fierce valor of your late father

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.110
and the martial strength of the Marquis of Northguard,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.040
you held compassion for the common folk,

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.980
and cared for the livelihood of the poor.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.700
With such devotion to the state and its people,

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.750
you are not at fault.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.990
They called you a scoundrel

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.390
whose disorderly governance

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.520
caused the northern army to rise

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.570
and seize the throne by force.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.590
The court cowered in trepidation

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.780
and the martial world grew disheartened.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.940
Fear stirred resentment

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.760
and bitterness took root against Your Majesty.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.500
While Your Majesty might have lost your throne

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.410
and is wandering the world aimlessly,

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.780
your devotion

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.430
shouldn't be confined only to the palace walls.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.920
Even far from the center of power,

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.290
you may still accomplish much.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.130
In this life,

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.650
I fear I will have no chance to see Your Majesty again.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.530
I pray only that Your Majesty

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.060
do not forget your original intention

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.410
for one day, it will surely

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.390
[From Han Ziling]

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.180
be heard

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.460
somewhere in the world.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.920
So your name is Han Ziling.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.250
For some reason,

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.210
the gates of the Imperial Jail

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.770
are opened.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.420
I guess

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.770
White Hair has fulfilled his promise.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.450
You've been sitting for a few decades.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.970
You can finally stand up now.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.020
I no longer have the right to sit.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.450
To save you,

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.500
I hid the fact

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.130
that White Hair was in Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.250
This is unfair

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.700
to the Huben Army.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.700
To protect myself,

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.550
I even gave away

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.610
the Huben Army's gold coin.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.910
This is also a form of betrayal.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.490
Mother,

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.170
like mother, like son indeed.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.560
Right now,

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.780
the Huben Army

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.980
no longer has anything to do with me.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.290
I think

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.170
I should leave.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.810
I should have

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.320
left sooner.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.580
[One Month Later]

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.340
Hot lamb soup!

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.370
- Yes. - Two?

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:18.040
It's fresh.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:20.640
Sure.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:24.610
Give me some.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:25.860
Here.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:32.590
Who are you?

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:33.700
It's me.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.820
Don't you remember me?

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.720
Little runt.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.060
You are a little runt.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:40.830
Indeed.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.870
I don't know who my parents are.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.370
Perhaps I'm someone no one wants.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.820
I was just kidding.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.650
Give me two jin of pork shoulder.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.800
My mother wants

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:54.980
to make stuffed flatbread tonight.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.510
Oh, it's you.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.130
I'm sorry.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.230
I can't help you this time.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:01.200
Why?

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.010
Didn't you go to the butcher's shop

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:04.420
to chop some meat for me last time?

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:05.940
That was the last time.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.850
This time, it's different.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:08.800
How so?

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:09.710
I'm different.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.920
You still look the same.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.130
Did you commit a crime?

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.150
A huge crime.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:21.890
Then,

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.590
can you still go home and eat?

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:25.850
I guess.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.300
However, I'm different.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:31.940
I have to earn

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:34.650
my own meal.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.320
That is why it's so meaningful.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:55.770
General,

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.300
dinner is ready.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:58.670
Let's wait for Wang Pu.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.460
He has gone to the market.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.650
He'll be slow with shackles on his feet.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.180
You may go back first.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:09.440
One more thing.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:11.280
Secret envoys of Tiemo have departed.

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:12.530
Yang Chuhao

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:13.700
is in charge of taking care of them.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.160
The Tiemo people are coming.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:20.980
White Hair should also be appearing soon.

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.300
He won't let go of this opportunity.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:27.820
Tell Yang Chuhao's men

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.250
to keep a close eye on it.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:29.770
Yes.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.920
Why hasn't Wang Pu come back?

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.460
I'll go and pick him up from the market.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:43.250
You spoil him, General.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.180
I captured Chang'an

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.100
but I didn't sit on the throne at Taiqing Hall.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.460
I moved to the market instead.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.610
However, if I have to eat alone,

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:53.890
I will

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.180
feel lonely.

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:10.350
I'll take two.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.670
Give me a discount.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.380
- General. - General.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.730
- General. - General.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.500
Keep drinking.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.310
All of you may leave.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.840
I have something to say to Mr. Wang Pu.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.690
- Yes. - Yes.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.220
When you're upset,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.970
drinking makes you inebriated faster.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.220
I dare not act recklessly before you.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.220
You've acted recklessly many times.

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.300
Zhiying cooks for us every day.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.420
She doesn't complain

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.530
yet you won't accept her kindness.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.220
It's not that I don't want her kindness.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.390
I feel guilty

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.130
and dare not eat.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.010
Do you not feel guilty

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.610
eating meat and drinking wine

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:13.100
in this eatery, then?

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.010
When I was managing Hidden Soldier Alley,

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.070
I gave him lots of benefits.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.370
Of course, I don't feel guilty.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:18.730
On the contrary,

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.100
I failed to solve your problem

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:22.850
and almost caused you to lose your life.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:24.490
I feel guilty.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.850
You won't win against White Hair.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.980
I might not even be able to do it either.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.630
Zhiying said I spoiled you.

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.940
I don't treat you

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:39.910
like how a general treats his subordinates.

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:44.060
However, you served me since you were young.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:45.770
I've never regarded you

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:47.130
as my subordinate.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.250
If a subordinate makes a mistake

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.130
and I kill him,

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:53.720
many more people are available

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.940
to obey my command.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.100
When you make a mistake

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.060
and don't come home to eat,

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.340
I come out to find you.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:03.340
I endure the night breeze,

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.100
as if I am looking for my own children.

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:20.650
It's time to go back.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:33.890
You're paying for real?

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:34.650
Of course.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.180
I won't kill you

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.130
just because you charged me.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:46.730
The reward is quite high.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:47.980
I know, right?

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.650
Have you seen this person before?

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.940
If I've seen him, I would've...

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:55.970
Let's go.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:56.540
Let's go.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:08.940
[Warrant]

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.420
It doesn't look like him.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.380
Master,

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:24.190
I'm back.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:28.650
It's time to go back.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.180
It's going to rain soon.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.230
We're going back when I just arrived?

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:35.380
Let's rest for a while longer.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:36.700
The air is good here,

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.980
unlike the gloomy and depressing Cangshui River.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.010
It's stuffy there.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:49.730
Master,

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.420
what is the story

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.940
behind Cangshui River?

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.010
I've been keeping watch from inside for a few days.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.300
And I noticed

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.370
some suspicious people.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.300
You are always keeping an eye on others.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.610
They will think you are the suspicious one, too.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.600
I have to do that.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.810
You know

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.010
who I'm protecting.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.940
Huai'an's father, Liu Ziwen,

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.700
is a rare talent.

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:13.980
He spent his whole life

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.490
protecting Chang'an.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:18.180
Hidden Soldier Alley

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.060
is the last line of defense.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:21.890
When it fails

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.220
and Chang'an falls,

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.420
the people and the government

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.300
have to move to Cangshui River.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:28.700
Unfortunately,

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:31.180
before Cangshui River was built,

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.100
he was killed.

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:36.340
Does Yan Fengshan

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.010
know about this place?

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.710
Or is there anyone in the Huben Army

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:39.830
who knows about this?

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.940
I am the manager of Cangshui River.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:43.940
Do you think I'm foolish enough

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:44.940
to let Yan Fengshan

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.100
and the others know about it?

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.460
I know you are the manager.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.370
Aren't we just having a friendly chat?

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.850
Moreover,

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:53.420
looking at you now,

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.010
you are just a boatman at most.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.770
I manage everything

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:57.610
from this boat.

00:16:58.750 --> 00:16:59.980
You can only reach Cangshui River

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.340
on this boat

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.530
using this river.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.080
Cangshui River

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:07.570
only houses refugees now.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.290
All of them have their lips sealed.

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:11.980
No need to be wary of them.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.530
All right.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.050
With you as the manager,

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:16.620
I'm relieved.

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:29.140
I'm leaving.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:30.220
Take care.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.180
Go on.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.180
Just leave it here.

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:48.250
Give it to me.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:49.090
No.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.080
Your salary.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:50.770
It's my turn.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:51.380
Pile them up.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:58.640
Slow down.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.140
Sir!

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:47.620
I'm done moving the goods.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.240
You've worked hard.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.940
Young men are indeed strong.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:57.420
With you around,

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.380
I can have it easy.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.180
Sir,

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.490
have you noticed

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.210
someone looking

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:11.250
at the shop all the time?

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.490
They are just staring

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:14.770
from right outside the shop.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.420
Although

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.450
they don't stand there for long,

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.100
do you think

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:21.320
there's something

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.730
in this shop that attracts attention?

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:23.660
Young man,

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.940
how long have you

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.340
been working here?

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.820
I've been here for quite some time.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.140
I was working in other shops

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.290
and you were hiring.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.930
I came here

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:38.900
because you paid more.

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:41.290
You are lying.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:42.730
I...

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.560
I'm not lying.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.730
It's all right.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.860
Everyone who comes here

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.940
is a person in misfortune.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.210
Everyone has it tough.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.730
It's normal

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:56.730
to keep everything to yourself.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.420
I'm sure

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.690
that you just arrived at Cangshui River.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.490
Why don't

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:05.900
you tell me

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.290
what time it is now?

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.620
They are here

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:21.050
to look at this.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.140
Along the streets,

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.180
there are many of these.

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:34.350
I wonder

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.460
which smart guy invented this.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.180
Anyway,

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.970
when I acquired this shop,

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:40.380
it was already here.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.290
That's right.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:42.730
From tomorrow onward,

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.990
you must scoop up the salt that leaks out

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.250
and pour it back in.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:48.730
But I still need to move the goods.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:50.650
Not anymore. Just watch the shop for me.

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.760
Really?

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.210
Tomorrow.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:57.210
Sure!

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.690
My back is sore

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:00.660
from moving the goods every day.

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.860
My shoulders are sore.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.490
You look delicate.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.690
You must have been a noble.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.490
But I don't have a noble's fate.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.730
I was just a pageboy.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.390
A pageboy?

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.280
Look at my chicken.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.190
Weigh your medicine first.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.340
You're back?

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:52.730
How's your brother?

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.210
Just like that.

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:02.340
I worked many jobs

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:03.940
and I still can't make a lot of money.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.650
This is tough.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:09.490
You've only worked for a few days

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:10.530
and you're already complaining.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:11.580
Listen.

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.910
This is life.

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.210
Life?

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:18.450
Life also needs...

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.860
That's right.

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:24.440
Starting tomorrow,

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.340
I'll be taking care of the salt shop.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.100
Someone needs to move the goods.

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.420
If you go there,

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:30.340
we'll have two people

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:31.580
working two jobs

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:32.860
and earning two salaries.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:35.340
Good idea.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:36.880
Working two jobs

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:37.860
and earning two salaries.

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:39.340
We even have money for wine.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.690
As expected of you.

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.730
No, thanks.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:49.180
Who was the one who said

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.180
this was life just now?

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.440
I said

00:24:54.441 --> 00:25:04.575
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.050
that was your life.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.880
I don't like your job

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:58.800
and you can't do

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:00.380
my job.

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:07.660
I wonder

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.660
how Huai'an is doing now.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.360
[Xuandu Temple]

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.860
If you weren't transferred out of Chang'an,

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:19.670
we wouldn't have this opportunity

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:21.090
to have tea so casually.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.940
Yet coming here

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:25.180
only fills me with disappointment.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.210
You've been in Chang'an for so many years.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.660
Don't you have any other ways?

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.010
Ways?

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:31.480
After Yan Fengshan

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.100
captured Chang'an,

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:35.010
the whole situation changed.

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:37.290
What ways do I have?

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:39.970
But I heard

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:41.690
nothing has changed in the imperial court.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.380
General Fengshan

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:45.050
doesn't even enter Taiqing Hall.

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:47.380
He even brought someone from the Xiao imperial family

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.380
to be the Emperor

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.250
to preserve the legitimacy of the Xiao dynasty.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:59.050
Do you really think

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.340
that young emperor

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:02.690
is from the Xiao family?

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:06.240
Whether I believe in it or not isn't important.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:07.320
The important thing

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.790
is when you can be

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:10.160
transferred back to Chang'an.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.380
I'll be honest with you.

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:18.250
On the surface level,

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.420
I was only an Imperial Guard.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.210
In truth,

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:24.940
I was actually serving Chancellor Gao.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.670
Now, Chancellor Gao

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.380
is doing worse than I am.

What makes you think

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.530
I can make a comeback again?

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:35.150
Nothing is absolute

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.760
in life.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.050
It's full of ups and downs.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.670
Don't dwell on it.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.580
When your next wave of fortune

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:42.380
comes,

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:43.530
you might

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.940
even go to further heights.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.840
If your temple

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.030
has more devotees,

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.920
I might believe you a little more.

Just stay here.

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:49.260
Mr. Wang Pu

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:50.780
is the most capable person

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:51.980
under General Fengshan.

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.860
Apologies for not recognizing you.

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:56.050
Forgive me.

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:57.210
That's enough.

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:58.460
Where is he?

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:00.380
He's in the hall at the back.

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:01.930
He said his name was Zeng.

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.980
He has been staying here

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.340
for about a month.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:05.550
Don't follow me.

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:07.210
I'll go inside alone.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.800
[Awakening and Returning to Purity]

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:55.390
You're here?

00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:58.170
Yes.

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:03.900
I'm cooking dumplings.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.090
I made some for you too.

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:06.700
Sure.

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:07.980
I'll dine with you.

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:13.420
I know you want to earn merit

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.420
and regain your dignity

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.380
in front of Yan Fengshan.

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.970
Thus,

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.490
I asked Commander Wang to lure you here.

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:23.050
He serves me.

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:25.170
I know that.

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:28.170
He acts quite well.

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.050
Right.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.940
I can't hide it from you for too long.

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:38.360
You're here.

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:41.050
It has been a while.

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:43.860
I've been waiting for you to summon me.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.610
Another move has to be made

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:47.940
to hit back against Yan Fengshan.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.050
I will never forget

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:51.970
what the chancellor did for me.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.010
As long as I can avenge the chancellor

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:56.340
and kill the Huben Army,

00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:59.530
I will do your bidding.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:01.650
I'm a criminal.

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:04.340
The general had a few men around me

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.050
to prevent me from escaping.

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:09.530
But after Commander Wang appeared

00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:10.820
and I left the city with him,

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.220
they stopped appearing.

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:14.860
That means

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:16.820
your men in the city

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.050
removed those sentries.

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.220
You are indeed the smartest tactician

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:24.720
under Yan Fengshan.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:26.700
The dumplings

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:28.490
will be done soon.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:29.780
Be patient.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:31.940
Stop flattering me.

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:33.780
I was completely outwitted by you

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.610
at Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:41.820
In that case,

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.780
you know

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:46.700
I am your opponent.

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.570
You also know that this is a trap.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:50.700
Why did you still come here?

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.010
Why not?

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.080
When I found out

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:00.780
you were keeping an eye on me,

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:03.650
I couldn't wait to appear before you

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:05.380
and see what tricks you have up your sleeves.
