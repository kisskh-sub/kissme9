Kid.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.200
I gave you three chances.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.280
But you made the same choice

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:14.520
as the Jibei King.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.920
Now,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.240
you have to accept

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.510
the fate we give you.

Don't let him go in there.

Fu Sheng.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.000
Your Majesty.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.040
Here you are.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.670
You are the real Jibei King.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.690
Looks like

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.910
you've seen me

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.970
out there.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.750
Yes.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.260
He looks younger than you.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.040
The current Jibei King

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.070
is Liu Luan.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.470
Now that you've come here and found me,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.190
I think

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.190
you must

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.400
know the truth, right?

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.880
Do you mean the plays outside?

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.670
The plays you saw

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.560
were what happened back then.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.760
Su Rang rebelled,

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.470
killed my father,

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.070
and took away my state.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.320
I'll never

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.510
forget all of that.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.730

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:08.560
That's right.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.320
It was that night.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.480
Su Rang

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.080
wanted to get rid of me

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.520
and replace me with a fake king.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:19.290
But he didn't expect

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:20.720
Sage Zhu

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.230
to tell me everything in advance

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.550
and help me escape.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.660
That's why I'm alive.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.470
Sage Zhu is my father.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.790
And he led me

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.080
to this place.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.470
Your father.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.080
Your father

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.280
saved my life.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.870
It seems that you are destined

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.720
to inherit everything from me.

My name is Fu Sheng.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.200
What do you mean

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.790
by inheriting everything from you?

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.790
The Breakwall

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.550
had the Bird Jade Plate.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.230
I had the Painting of Luan.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.790
On my wedding night,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.990
Su Rang set me up to kill me.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.490
Sage Zhu stole the Bird Jade Plate

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.960
and helped me escape from the Jibei Palace.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.600
I escaped to Xichuan

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.550
with part of the Royal Army

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.520
that was still loyal to me.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:52.720
In Xichuan,

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.470
we found the retreat

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.550
left by the first Jibei King.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:00.260
This is it.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.670
The Sealed Book Underground Palace.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.210
This place was left by the first Jibei King.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.640
No wonder.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.130
That's right.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.160
There are

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.720
countless treasures

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.080
and Star Gold weapons

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.550
used to fight a war.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.840
We planned

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.520
to hide here for months

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:23.310
and then

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.310
go after the rebels.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.280
We didn't realize the underground palace

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.320
wouldn't open from the inside.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.570
Only the person with the Bird Jade Plate and the Painting of Luan

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:36.810
can open the underground palace

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.440
and get us out of there.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.370
Just to be safe,

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.490
before I entered the underground palace,

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.440
I asked the Royal Army

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.440
to send out the jade and the painting.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.880
But

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.540
no one ever came.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.760
That's because Su Rang

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:52.640
forced the lord of Xichuan

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.090
in the name of the palace

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.290
to send his army

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:59.910
to kill the Royal Army.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.270
That's what I thought.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.880
The environment

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:10.760
is terrible.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.320
During the long wait,

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.680
many people

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:16.680
fell ill

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:18.640
and died.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.120
I was also

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:23.720
seriously ill.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.840
I know I don't have long to live.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.510
So I had them use illusions

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.080
to recreate the scenes from back then

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.730
so that the person who opens the underground palace

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.870
can learn the truth.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.480
So,

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.060
after you entered the underground palace,

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.240
you were confused by the miasma here.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:45.660
Those illusions

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.920
were created by us

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.330
with miasma that was unique to this place

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.760
and poisons.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.280
No wonder

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.200
we've been seeing illusions

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.680
since we came in.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:58.660
That's right.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.920
We want to use these illusions.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.610
First,

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.060
we can pass down history.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.490
I want my successor to remember

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.660
to destroy the Breakwall.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:14.320
Second,

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.880
I want to test my successor.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:18.950
Fu Sheng.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.200
You have passed the test.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.560
You can be my successor.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.120
I still don't understand

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.030
why you chose me.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.680
Because every choice you make

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:36.710
is the same as mine.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.110
You are kind,

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:42.830
smart, and resilient.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.750
You're

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:51.490
Really?

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.350
You've been lingering here

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.470
for 20 years.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.230
I didn't expect you to want to take revenge on me.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:12.870
It was a mistake

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.200
for me to let you go twenty years ago.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.280
Today, I'm going to correct that mistake.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:20.440

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.040
Go.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.040
Cut off his head.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:26.130
Yes.

He's our Lord.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.680
Back off.

I'll intercede for you.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.240
I became a soldier

at sixteen.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.980
I participated in more than 20 battles.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.990
I didn't realize I was defending these rebels.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:08.950
fight you.

why I came to Xichuan.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.710

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.830
There may be some loyal servants

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:26.320
who come out of nowhere

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.350
to protect their king.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.210
If I can't get rid of Liu Luan,

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.800
I can't sleep.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.260
I'm willing to handle it.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.210
Good.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.400
Come on. Arrest him.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:04.750
Madam.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.680
Don't help the bad man, madam.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:07.920
Don't do it.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:08.830
No.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.160
Don't help the bad man, madam.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.830
Madam, wake up.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:14.920
Liu Luan.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.830
I don't think you're 40 yet.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.080
Why are you so old?

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:25.870
I have hatred in my heart.

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.400
I want you to die.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.110
I can't sleep.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.760
You don't have to do this.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.920
Isn't it good to be a useless man in the palace?

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.440
Maybe you can live a hundred years.

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:43.920
There are many people in the Liu family.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.350
When I am dead,

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.400
maybe you can control the state again.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.320
You don't have

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.110
to die here.

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:00.980
The Liu family

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.280
is royalty.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.870
We'll never live under you,

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.200
a eunuch.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.070
The winner takes all.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.110
If you want to kill me, just do it.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:15.110
Don't talk nonsense.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:56.470
Sishui.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.870
Kill them all.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.280
Let's go back home.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:40.580
- Long live the king. - Long live the king.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:52.060
[Years later]

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.160
Your Majesty.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.280
What is it?

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:22.160
Who rebelled?

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.440
The three commanderies outside Jibei.

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:25.680
They rebelled in the name

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:26.870
of restoring the Liu family's power.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.110
Liu family.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.560
I killed all the Lius

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.800
more than ten years ago.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.150
There is no Liu family anymore.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.080
They think

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:49.320
I don't have children,

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.440
so they want to fight for power.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:58.510
They thought I didn't know who was behind them.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.560
Maybe

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.480
that man is in the court

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.010
of my Jibei State.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:08.910
Your Majesty.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.080
What do we do next?

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:12.480
Kill them.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.030
Kill them all.

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:16.840
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.990
I'll lead an army to quell the rebellion.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:20.510
I'll kill them.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.240
Medicine. Give me the medicine.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:36.510
Your Majesty.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.630
Japonicus is poisonous.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:39.910
Why are you still using it?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.870
After I became the Jibei King,

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.430
I handled everything personally.

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:54.840
I don't have enough energy.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.520
If it weren't for that,

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.030
I wouldn't be able to make it this far.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.960
Your Majesty, you will live a long life.

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:06.360
Go.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.080
I'm waiting for your good news.

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.120
Who's making a big noise?

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.360
It's you.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.030
Where is Guo Sishui?

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:58.240
General Guo

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.670
is waiting for you in the netherworld, My Lord.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:02.560
No, Your Majesty.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:04.950
Your Majesty.

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:08.120
Don't keep General Guo waiting too long.

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:08.950
Am I right?

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:10.800
You...

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:12.320
I should...

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.520
I should have killed you back then.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.080
You rat.

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.670
What's the point of all this?

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:23.430
The winner takes all.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.710
I learned it from you.

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:26.390
How about it?

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.910
Do I look like you?

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.760
You...

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:36.840
Medicine...

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:39.390
Medicine.

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:42.600
Give me the medicine.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.230
Get it yourself.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.630
Give me...

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.490
Medicine.

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.120
Give me the medicine.

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:56.390
Call me father,

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.520
and I'll give you the medicine.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:04.560
Rat.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:30.320
Fu Sheng.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.120
Why aren't you dead?

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.670
I see.

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:43.910
Come on.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.120
I, Su Rang,

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.230
have never been afraid of anyone.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.730
I'm also not afraid of ghosts.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.840
Look at the situation.

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:58.360
You still won't give up.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.800
You fought for fame and fortune all your life.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.470
Is this

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.560
what you want?

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.430
I don't regret it.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.840
I regret...

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.950
that I have only now

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:19.120
seen through your tricks.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:20.560
So you've seen through it?

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.000
It's too late.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:54.140
Si...

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.360
When did I fall for your trick?

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.080
From the moment you entered this place.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:16.760
I don't regret it.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:20.230
I'm a eunuch.

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.710
I'm happy

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.670
to get to where I am today.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.410
I...

00:20:59.120 --> 00:20:59.950
Your Majesty.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.710
I have killed sinners.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:08.670
Reliable servant.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:13.630
You're my reliable servant.

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:21.630
Get up.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.080
Why didn't anyone recognize his true face?

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.600
He was right again.

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:35.390
Looks like he's going up again.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.390
Your Majesty.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.040
Fu Sheng.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:57.630
Help me.

00:21:58.790 --> 00:21:59.520
Fu Sheng.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:02.040
Twenty years ago,

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.560
I met someone like you.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.080
Because of him,

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.670
I spent twenty years

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:12.600
in this dark underground palace.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.520
I won't make the same mistake again.

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:20.150
Help me.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:21.800
Fu Sheng.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.600
The knife was poisoned.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.470
You can't save him.

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:28.950
Help me.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.360
Fu Sheng.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.760
Am I going to die?

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:46.280
Mother.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.630
Brother.

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:53.040
I saw Mother

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.430
again.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.830
If you see anything you want to eat

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.840
in the Chamber of Commerce,

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.470
no, the whole of Xichuan,

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:04.840
just eat it.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.710
You can have whatever you want.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.190
What if someone kicks us out?

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:15.080
I'm in charge now.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.560
It doesn't hurt.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.000
It doesn't hurt.

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:08.670
What are you doing here?

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:09.950
Where's my father?

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.390
Su Rang rebelled.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.000
We killed him.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.120
Rebelled?

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.470
He's the Lord of the Breakwall.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:20.630
You...

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:22.870
Come on.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:23.910
Come on.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.520
They killed Attendant Su.

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.430
Shoot them.

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.840
Wait.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:00.950
He's fake.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.390
He's fake.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:03.600
He's impersonating me.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.360
Shoot him.

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.600
You are the fake one.

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:10.080
Su Rang is dead.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.150
Only I

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.390
can make Japonicus.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.320
Don't resist.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.670
Think about your old days.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:26.270
Your Majesty.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:27.430
Your Majesty, please spare me.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.630
Your Majesty, please spare me.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:31.280
I'm fake.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:33.710
I'm fake.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.040
It's Su Rang's fault.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.840
Su Rang made me do it.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:38.760
Your Majesty.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.040
Your Majesty, please spare me.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:40.710
Your Majesty.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.000
Your Majesty, please spare me.

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.910
Your Majesty.

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:45.910
Get up.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:49.760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:51.950
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:23.910
Your Majesty.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.800
I'm back.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.760
Congratulations on your return, Your Majesty.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.600
Congratulations on your return, Your Majesty.

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:39.390
Congratulations on your return, Your Majesty.

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:42.120
Congratulations on your return, Your Majesty.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.760
Get up.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.870
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.920
Twenty years have passed.

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:26.480
I almost forgot

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.520
how warm

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:31.070
the sun was on me.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.870
All this time,

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.310
people say

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:39.720
that the person who gets the Sealed Book rules the world.

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:42.110
But I don't understand

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:45.150
the point of the Sealed Book.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:52.840
At first,

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.360
I didn't understand the Sealed Book.

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:58.470
I took people into the underground palace and rummaged around.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.760
We only found a lot of treasure.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.630
We didn't find any books.

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:06.000
Is the legend

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.630
of the Sealed Book fake?

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:10.670
That's what I thought at the time.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.150
Since then,

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.040
I've been getting depressed.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.310
I sat in the empty court all day,

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:19.520
looking at the stone wall.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.360
I sat there for twenty years.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.760
There were countless treasures beside the stone wall.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.470
One day,

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:28.840
all of a sudden,

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:31.120
I realized

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.050
what the Sealed Book is.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:35.000
What is it?

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.040
It's the best way to run a state.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.800
To a state, the people are the most important. The state comes second.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.470
The ruler is the least important.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.800
It's ridiculous.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.840
I used to think

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.560
that I was the most important.

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.710
The world works

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:58.800
only when I'm in it.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.520
Otherwise,

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.560
people will live in misery.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.280
You,

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.280
to be precise,

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:11.190
most of the rulers,

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:12.950
think too much of themselves.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.230
You're right.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.950
It wasn't until that moment that I understood

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.470
it was not me

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:25.490
who kept the world running,

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:28.700
nor those treasures,

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.560
but the people.

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:35.840
For them,

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.600
as long as they have a home,

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.120
grain fields,

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:44.080
and livestock,

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.760
they can live a life

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:49.320
in peace.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.230
Even without me as a king,

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:53.800
their lives wouldn't be affected.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.870
The people are the most important, but that doesn't mean the king is useless.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.910
You have your responsibilities.

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:01.360
You're right.

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:03.760
What I should do

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.710
is protect the people

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:09.080
and let them live a stable and prosperous life.

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:10.010
This

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.840
is what a king should do,

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.090
the way of running a state.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:16.760
This

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.630
is the real treasure of the Sealed Book.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.560
In that case,

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:38.390
I also have a Sealed Book.

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:42.150
What is it about?

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:46.080
A physician should have professional skills and a kind heart.

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.520
This book

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.360
is from my father.

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:06.230
Father, you made it.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.510
You're awesome.

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:08.240
Am I good?

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:09.600
Have a taste.

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:10.030
Okay.

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:10.690
Come on.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:12.710
Come on.

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:13.410
Come on.

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:18.000
Is it sweet?

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:23.190
Jue.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.360
I'm getting old.

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:26.710
I want to retire.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.800
I'll leave the Xichuan

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:29.870
to you.

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:33.280
Father.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.630
You're not old.

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:36.280
Yeah, I'm not old.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:38.080
Look.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.230
You've grown up.

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:41.150
I'm relieved to hand the Xichuan

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:41.870
over to you.

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:42.840
Father.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:43.420
Jue.

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:45.870
Look at Dove.

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:47.080
She's younger than you.

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.600
But she has become the butler of the Lord's Mansion.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:51.760
Dove.

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:53.600
My lady.

00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:57.360
My lady.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.350
You've been at the clinic a lot lately.

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:00.710
I haven't seen you in a long time.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.870
It's not because I've been at the clinic a lot.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.520
It's because you've been busy

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:05.630
since you became the butler.

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:06.910
My father is to blame.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.110
You are young. But he gave you a heavy position.

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:11.040
Thank you, my lord.

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:13.040
Not at all. Get back to work.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:24.800
Father.

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:26.840
I can see what you mean.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.080
I can take over the Xichuan.

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:30.280
However,

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.950
I have to get some work done first.

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:33.630
Before it's done,

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.670
I need you

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:35.760
to keep to your post.

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:37.840
Jue, what are you going to do?

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:40.470
I have to go.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.120
Jue, you...

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.760
Father.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.040
It may take a while before I can come back to see you.

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:55.600
See you.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:11.630
Forget it.

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:15.000
She doesn't eat. We'll eat.

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:23.630
Jiu, have one piece.

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.800
Eat.

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:28.430
Eat.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.190
Watermelon is cold.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:39.280
Don't eat too much.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.600
I always thought of you as my adopted son.

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.870
Jue and you grew up together.

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:45.800
You're brother and sister.

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:48.230
Father.

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.400
I can't bear drinking

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.800
the Xinghua Wine you gave me.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.600
Today is a good day.

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:59.040
I'll drink it.

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:01.940
[Save Lives from Disease]

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:41.740
[Save Lives from Disease]

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.160
[Moral and Artistic Stature]

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.520
Hulu.

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:54.960
Where is your master?

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:56.600
My master went out.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.520
Ms. Tuoba, do you want to see him?

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:00.520
No, it's all right.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:14.190
Please give this to him.

00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:00.000
Sister, you don't know.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.440
Gu is nagging.

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:05.830
He nagged and kept crying

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.630
at your bedside this morning.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.150
He woke me up.

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:12.520
I said you need to recuperate quietly.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.960
I didn't expect him to start crying silently.

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.670
It's so weird.

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.750
So I drove him out.

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:24.560
Sister, I...

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:25.790
I'll go to collect herbs.

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:27.480
You stay at home.

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:15.880
Are you here to collect herbs?

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.790
I'm planting radishes.

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:25.790
It's you.

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:27.120
Do you know me?

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:30.040
No, I don't know you.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.960
Why are you planting radishes?

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:37.230
My brother told me

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.440
that we would never be kicked out

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.750
of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.710
I listened to him. So I didn't farm.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.080
But I got kicked out.

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.400
I have to farm.

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:50.630
When the radish trees grow up,

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:52.920
I'll lie under them

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:55.440
and wait for the radishes to fall into my mouth.

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:57.350
When my brother comes back, he'll have food.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.630
Do you think radishes grow on trees?

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:05.350
You know

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.040
nothing about farming.

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.560
You don't even know radish trees.

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:12.400
Good thing you didn't plan on planting a pig tree.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.880
You didn't bury piglets in the ground.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.350
Do you think I'm stupid?

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.440
Can you plant pigs in the field?

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:20.710
When the trees bear a lot of piglets,

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.080
they will shit over my head

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.400
as I lie under the trees.

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:25.880
When they grow into pigs,

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:27.420
they will run all over the mountain.

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:28.520
I can't catch them.

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:31.270
Hum.

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:38.230
What are you doing?

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:40.790
These are my brother's things.

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:45.230
My brother hasn't been back for a long time.

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:49.630
I miss him.

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.080
If I

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.830
plant these in the ground,

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.560
maybe a new brother will grow out of them.

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:34.880
Brother.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:38.920
I miss you.

00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:57.850
Fu Sheng.

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:00.400
Don't you want

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:01.960
to be Jibei King's physician officer?

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:03.640
Forget it.

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.600
I don't want to be an officer. It's not free.

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:11.630
You don't know how good that would be.

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:13.080
If I were you,

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.790
I would go with him.

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:18.440
You love money, don't you?

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.920
Jibei King gave you some gold bars.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:21.790
Aren't you satisfied?

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:24.670
Don't even mention it.

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.510
Jibei King is petty.

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.150
He only gave me a few gold bars.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.600
I thought about it last night.

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:34.000
We had many dangers

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.080
along the way

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:38.830
and almost died.

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:40.480
It's not worth it.

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:46.440
Forget it.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.440
I'm easily satisfied.

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:52.630
I'm not very rich.

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:55.230
But I have enough money

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.520
to buy a house and land.

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.040
I'll get my brothers here

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.270
and give them a good life.

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:06.710
Guys, what are you talking about?

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.960
Wen Jue, why are you so late?

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:10.630
I got stuck.

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:11.190
Let's go.

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:12.480
Wen Jue.

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:15.880
Fu Sheng and I are from Shangyi.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.560
We're going home to have a look.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:20.120
Why do you want to go with us?

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:22.790
We will go to Shangyi first.

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:24.350
Then, we'll go to the Central Plains.

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:25.560
The Central Plains?

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:26.710
Don't you know?

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.600
What are we going to do?

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.480
I heard that my master appeared in the Central Plains.

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:33.830
If we can

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.520
take him to Xichuan,

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.710
we can save Yingying.

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:40.520
Really?

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:41.750
I've never lied to you.

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:43.230
All right. Let's go.

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:44.150
The sun is going down.

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:45.400
Let's go.
