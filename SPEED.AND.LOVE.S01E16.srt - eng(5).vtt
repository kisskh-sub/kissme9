It's fine. I'll go change.

I'll go with you.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.010
Let me see.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.760
There's so much ketchup.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.640
Wear black. You look cool in black.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.070
Okay.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.140
You are so pale.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.500
That area never gets any sun.

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:44.270
I didn't mean to look.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.470
Help me put it on.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.430
The two fish you caught today
are really plump.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.510
Do you think they weigh
at least 6 to 7 jin?

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.470
I've never failed at fishing.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.600

Mu, you're home?

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.740
What happened to the kitchen?

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.590
Mom, I want ice cream.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.020
There's some in the fridge. Help yourself.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.110
Mom, where's my tablet?

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.510
Isn't it in your sister's room?

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.640
Go get it from there.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:08.860
Wait, don't go.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.360
She's asleep.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.270
You hide inside.
I'll go out and handle this.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:21.910
Why should I hide?

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.880
This is my house.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.780
What if they find out

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.150
that we're in a room with the lights off?

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.410
It wouldn't look good.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.240
Neither of us needs to hide.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.380
You're acting guilty for no reason.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.070
You're not nervous?

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.830
Not at all.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.060
How...

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:36.950
do you manage that?

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.610
How am I supposed to prove it to you?

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.110
Are you thinking of
something inappropriate?

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.140
Who thought that way first?

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.700
You did.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.720
Mom, Sister is still awake.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.070
Mu.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:58.890
You're not yet asleep?

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.800
If you aren't, your sister will be
heading in to get her tablet.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:03.900
Go ahead.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:13.710
Brother?

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.800
Your tablet.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.440
Did you receive the rice?

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.070
Yes, we'll try it tonight.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.720
Zhao, stay for dinner tonight.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.560
Jin Qiang caught two big fish.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.330
Sure, let me cook a dish or two.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.330
Forget it.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.290
With your cooking skills,

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.030
you are going to ruin my fish.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.220
I'll cook it myself.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.480
Then be quick about it.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.670
Jiang Mu is in for a treat.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.180
Fishing?

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.860
Eating fish.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.460
Jin Qiang caught two big fish.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.130
Mu.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:52.510
What's wrong?

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.350
Are you feeling warm?

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:55.390
What...

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.360
What's with your face?

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.900
It looks a bit flushed.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.860
What were you two doing in the room?

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.950
The light kept turning on and off.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.740
The switch isn't working properly.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.000
I was helping to fix it.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.980
Nothing works properly in this house.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.710
There's always one thing or another
that is broken.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.270
Don't worry. Queue up.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.250
I'll fix everything one by one.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:16.450
You're first in line.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:17.700
First, quit drinking.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.630
I would be completely broken if so.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.260
What are you laughing at?

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.220
Mrs. Zhao is funny.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.299
Try this fish. See if it's good.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:38.150
How is it?

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:42.760
This is the best fish
I've ever had in my life.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:44.430
Then have some more.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:45.660
How old are you now

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.960
to be talking about a lifetime?

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.420
Well then, can you cook as well?

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.110
Yes, I can.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.460
Could yours be as good as Dad's?

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.360
I can try it someday.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.330
He doesn't stand a chance.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:01.640
Thank you, Dad.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.290
This is nice.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:06.500
It's been so long since our family

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.150
has gotten together like this

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.820
to enjoy a good meal. Come on.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.320
Let's eat together more often from now on.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:16.530
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.220
Before Mu arrived,

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.700
we hardly ever saw Zhao around.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.150
But since Mu came,

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.780
we've been seeing Zhao

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.180
more and more often, haven't we?

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:27.880
These two are inseparable.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.140
They've been like that
since they were little.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.070
That was when they were very young.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.080
These two are all grown up now.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.290
Things must be different from
when they were children.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.280
Sister Mu must really like
Brother Jin Zhao, right?

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.970
Your sister is asking you a question.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:50.820
What?

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.480
You like Brother Jin Zhao a lot, right?

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.750
W-why are you asking that?

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.030
Because you cried that one time
when you couldn't find

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.030
Brother Jin Zhao.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.760
Really? When did that happen?

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.270
Mu.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.500
How old are you now?

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.830
Were you really crying?

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.190
No, I was crying because...

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.870
Because...

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:21.320
Because I saw some letters.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.090
What letters?

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.700
Some letters...

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.520
which were hidden behind
the archery target.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.550
Brother, let's go to the beach tomorrow.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:03.750
Sure.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.700
Zhao.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:06.950
Zhao?

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:09.200
Do you have time?

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:10.340
Yes, I do.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.000
That's great!

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.630
It's been so long since
we went out together.

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:14.630
Great! Come on.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.210
Let's have another drink.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.070
What happened there?

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.840
The floor is cold.
Let me pick it up for you.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.080
You did that on purpose.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:38.870
Yes,

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.340
I did it on purpose.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.590
-This yacht is so big!
-How beautiful!

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.700
The scenery is gorgeous!

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.300
It's been so long since
we've been on a holiday.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.490
Today, let's all relax

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:11.620
and have a good time!

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.350
The sea...

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:14.540
is so vast!

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:16.100
How annoying.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:17.180
-I want a photo too.
-Today,

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.780
let's all unwind and relax.

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.290
Xin, come take photos with us.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:34.990
Today...

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.400
-How is it?
-You have been working hard.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.940
We finally have a chance to relax today.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.030
If we are relaxing, why can't you
let me have a drink?

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:40.890
Just wait a bit.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.940
If you want to drink,

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.870
I'll drink with you tonight, okay?

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:45.570
You little rascal.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:48.470
There must be a bar on this yacht, right?

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.000
No, don't you dare tell him.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.540
I already said
I'll drink with you tonight.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:53.890
I'll tell you later.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.060
-Let's take a photo first.
-Dad!

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.060
I want to eat fish.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:57.780
Dad will catch some for you.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:58.580
That's right!

00:12:59.060 --> 00:12:59.990
Let's go fishing.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.940
As long as you aren't drinking,

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.500
-I want to go fishing too.
-we can do anything.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.700
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.180
Why can't I catch even one fish?

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.340
My fishing rod is broken too.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.240
I've got one! I've got one!

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:15.750
Another fish!

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:17.350
Here comes another one.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:18.990
That's amazing!

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:22.580
Help me hold this.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.460
Be careful!

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.910
Why haven't I caught a single fish?

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:30.420
Honey, you could change careers.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:31.390
Don't be a chef,

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.460
but become a fisherman instead.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.940
How's it going over there?

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:35.820
Any signs?

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.550
I can't even feel a single fish.

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.700
Zhao.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.310
Auntie Zhao owes you an apology.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.510
You've been living away from us
for so long,

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:46.170
and I haven't shown you
enough care and concern.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.330
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:49.460
Tell me all about it.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.420
Our Zhao is so handsome.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.680
There must be many girls who like you.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:00.840
There aren't.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.350
What's Wan Shengbang's daughter name?

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:04.480
Her name is Wan Qing,

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:05.910
Snakey.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.110
Mu, why do you know so much?

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.920
What's that girl like?

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:13.780
She's great.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:14.640
She's very hot.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.580
What do you mean by "hot"?

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.680
Her looks, personality, and figure

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:22.540
are all pretty hot.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:23.510
Really?

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:24.510
Zhao,

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.540
do you like this kind of girl?

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:29.460
No, I don't.

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:32.630
How gossipy.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.270
Well, I am just trying to have a chat

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.150
as the wait for fish seems pretty long.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:39.910
Yeah, we haven't caught anything in hours.

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.040
Let's stop fishing.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.440
By the way,
there's a home theatre on the yacht,

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.050
and a karaoke room too.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:46.990
Come on, let's stop fishing.

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.820
Let's go sing.

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.630
Zhao.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:52.690
I'm not going.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:54.350
I'm tired from driving earlier.

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:55.470
I want to take a nap.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.110
I'm not going either.

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:58.770
I want to look around the boat.

00:14:58.780 --> 00:14:59.710
I'll go with you.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:02.060
I just remembered

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:03.660
I have a conference call with Nana

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.460
to discuss the venue
for our next charity performance.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.150
Okay.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.870
Honey,

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:10.950
let's go sing instead of fishing.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:11.990
Give me back my flask

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.120
and I'll go with you.

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.080
Keep fishing then.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:16.400
Come on, Xin.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.400
Shall we go sing together?

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:18.990
Sure!

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.160
Finished with your call?

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:49.960
You're up from your nap.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.420
Do you want to go for a swim?

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:55.670
Do you really like Wan Qing's body type?

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.460
If you want to swim,

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:01.540
I can join you.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.180
How do you know I can swim?

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.060
If you can't swim,

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.550
you can hold onto me.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:13.890
That's a pity.

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:15.810
I'm actually a great swimmer.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:20.150
Then let's...

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:22.610
do something else.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:24.390
No, no. The scenery here isn't nice.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:25.520
Let's go over there!

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.760
Quick, hide!

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:31.940
Come on!

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.400
Good, right here.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:34.940
The view is nice here.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.780
Alright, let's take a photo.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.060
Perfect!

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.780
Let's take a couple more over there.

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:40.910
Let's go this way!

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.300
This spot is good.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:49.520
What's that noise?

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:51.750
Nothing, it's just a big fish.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:54.660
Mu!

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.030
Sister?

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:57.680
What are you doing here?

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.580
Well, it was stuffy in the room

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:01.530
so I came out to get some fresh air.

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:04.280
All by yourself?

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:06.940
Don't worry, I won't go into the water.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.920
Swim back quickly!

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.910
Hurry up!

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:26.400
Sister, here you go.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.420
One is enough.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:29.910
No, you need two.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:47.500
You scared me!
Why did you jump into the sea?

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.360
Your nerves are just incredible.

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:54.970
I didn't expect you could keep your cool
under pressure like that.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:56.290
Are you cold?

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.740
This is ice cream Jin Xin gave me.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:02.800
She left two,

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:04.310
which means one is for me.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:05.790
How do you know that?

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:07.840
That kid knows everything.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.700
You're not even blood-related,

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.270
yet you understand her so well.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:12.800
Are you two blood-related then?

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.240
Am I the same as her, Brother Jin Zhao?

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:20.170
You already know the answer.

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.940
I'm dirty.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.170
I don't mind you dirty.

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:03.350
Let me see

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:05.390
where you are dirty.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:07.320
Brandy! This shampoo is really...

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:13.260
Don't move.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.300
One, two, three!

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.740
Jiang Mu, what are you doing?

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:19.100
He has a strand of white hair

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.870
and I was helping him pull it out.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:21.830
White hair?

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:24.870
Oh my god!

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.500
The former campus heartthrob
is aging prematurely.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.830
Where's the white hair?

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.100
I threw it on the floor,
so you can't see it now.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.300
It's been pulled out?

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.420
What brings you here?

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.590
This shampoo works really well for Xishi.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:41.050
I brought it for you to try.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:45.900
Leave the stuff here.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:46.700
You can go now.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:48.620
Bye.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:49.660
Bye bye.

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:54.940
He scared me.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.110
Brandy! Actually, I think...

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.110
Scram.

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:01.840
I really think it's not bad.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.410
Ji, are you done over there?

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:13.650
Just a bit more.

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:20.650
Wait for me inside.

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:33.610
Let's take a break.

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:35.700
It's fine, Master. I'm not tired.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.220
I'll finish fixing this car.

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.420
Let's do it tomorrow.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:39.730
Go out and stretch your legs.

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:41.550
It's okay. This is the last one.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:44.430
We'll be done once I help him
finish this up.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:48.590
Yang.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.680
Go out and buy me a bottle of water.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.050
I just bought water this morning.

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:56.910
You can have it.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.730
It's brand new with the seal intact.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:01.790
Go ahead and drink it.

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:03.390
It's really unopened. Look.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.850
I... I don't want water.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:07.710
Go buy me some coconut water.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:09.070
Make it cold.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:10.390
Didn't you used to
not drink coconut water?

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:12.460
I suddenly have
a craving for coconut water.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.550
And it has to be cold?

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:14.680
Yes, it must be cold.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.040
Ji.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:19.660
Go to the hardware store on West Street.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.220
Please buy some parts for me.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.510
I'll send you the model numbers later.

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:23.070
But...

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.050
Don't we have spares in the shop?

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:28.690
I want new ones.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.700
Alright.

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:32.970
Master, lend me your keys.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:33.830
I'll go by bike.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.240
Why do you need keys for?

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.900
Let the bike rest. Go on foot.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.110
-Why does the bike need rest?
-Come on.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:39.790
Take this money.

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:40.740
Get something to eat on the way.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:41.310
Make sure you eat enough.

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:42.840
-Go on.
-Why are you so rich?

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:43.390
Okay.

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:44.270
Don't you want anything to eat?

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:44.940
I'm not eating!

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:45.550
Okay.

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:33.110

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.150
I sent them all away.

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:36.180

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.180
Yes.

Wait.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.410
Why is it here?

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.200
Are you afraid it will tell others?

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:00.560
Dogs are very smart these days.

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:12.150
Are we good now?

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.300

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.500
there's a meteor shower tonight.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.320

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:48.790

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.030

Even if I have only you in my arms

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:49.000
I probably won't give you
a chance to change your mind.

Are you sure you don't want me to
keep you company?

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:40.670
Just grab a car.

00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:41.800
Get some rest early.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.430
Okay.

00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:56.100
Yiwen, who you're looking for,
didn't come tonight.

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.560
But he booked a hotel room.

00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:59.460
I'll send you the address later.

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:00.590
Do you need any help?

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:03.190
Not for now.

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:04.220
Thank you.

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:06.620
It seems that

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:08.970
your life has changed a bit recently.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.480
Is our previous agreement

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.840
still valid?

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:21.110
What I promised you,

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:22.920
I will definitely fulfill.

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:24.790
But now...

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:26.390
I need something.

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:27.270
Tell me.

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:30.420
The competition map.

00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:25.280
Where did you go?

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:28.550
I just went for a walk.

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:31.810
Did you have to turn your phone off
as you walked?

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.240
Move aside. I need to get through.

00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:42.150
You've been crying.

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:43.530
No, I haven't.

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:49.500
I've upset you.

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:55.360
Yes.

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:58.490
You've upset me.

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.140
What can I do to make you feel better?

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:16.230
I can't feel better.

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.860
I'll never feel better again.

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:28.480
I'm sorry.

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:34.060
I'm sorry.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:36.060
I'm sorry.

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:51.230
Mu.

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:54.540
It's not what you think.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.580
