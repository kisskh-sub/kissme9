=Episode 26=

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.140
Jin,

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.150
did you go to a wedding

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.333
with your boyfriend yesterday?

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.970
How did you know?

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.870
See?

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.300
I told you it was her boyfriend.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.740
You two

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.170
tricked me?

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.430
No.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.680
I saw a photo

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.850
on my ex-colleague's Moments.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.780
What photo?

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.155
You two have sharp eyes.

00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:21.040
It's a shame
you're not in criminal investigation.

00:02:21.044 --> 00:02:22.000
Who is the guy?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.970
Do we know him?

00:02:23.044 --> 00:02:24.377
Is there a photo from the front?

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.910
Judging from his back,

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.100
he looks pretty handsome.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.666
Did you finish revising your proposal?

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.220
Get back to your work.

00:02:32.844 --> 00:02:33.630
- Jin...
- Jin...

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.310
I have a conference call later. I'm off.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.280
- Jin.
- Tell us, please.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.310
We won't tell anyone.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.066
Send me the proposal before the meeting.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.620
What's this smell?

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.410
Smells like happiness, right?

00:02:56.622 --> 00:02:57.380
Can you see that?

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.380
Is that Li Wu?

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.380
Him?

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.810
I don't think so.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.810
What's wrong with your eyes?

00:03:06.844 --> 00:03:09.220
How can you not tell it's him?
It's clearly Li Wu.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.010
That's not the point.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.120
The point is,

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.940
why are they holding hands?

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.850
That's not normal.

00:03:18.933 --> 00:03:19.888
Something's going on.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.660
From recycling

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.940
and resource reuse,

00:03:24.022 --> 00:03:25.533
it can provide data to make a decision.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.120
This whole afternoon

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.290
has been really insightful.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.870
I'll sort out

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.360
the ideas.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.120
If there's anything I don't understand,

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.180
I'll ask you again.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.220
Alright.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.080
Go get busy.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.266
Thank you, Professor Liu.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.940
I won't keep you any longer.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:45.250
Alright.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.970
Incorrect password.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.250
Zero nine zero three.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.130
You're here, Mrs. Cen.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.690
Wu.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.080
You're home?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.940
Not at work?

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:15.560
I'm done for the day,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.830
so I came back early

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:17.888
for a conference call.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.020
Go ahead and work.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.920
I came to visit Jin

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.020
and brought her some food.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.950
It's fine.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.390
I'm done with work.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.100
I'll help you bring these in.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.490
Sure.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.660
What's wrong with this lock?

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.370
I'll do it.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:37.850
Don't worry. I got it.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.340
I always get it wrong.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.040
You've been away so long,

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.530
and you still remember the password?

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.340
Well...

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.600
Yeah.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.100
Well,

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.120
I didn't remember it before either.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.850
It's just that

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.340
I live nearby,

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.850
so, when I help Sister

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.480
take parcels

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.390
or something,

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.370
she told me.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.370
Right, taking parcels.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.950
A few days ago,

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.170
I told Jin

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.870
that since you two live right across,

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.260
you can look out for each other.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.510
See?

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.140
Yeah.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.270
Yes. Right.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.160
Please come in.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.580
Good.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.660
Mrs. Cen, do you want me

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.100
to put these in the fridge?

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.340
Yes.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:32.460
Wu,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.270
you've been living right across

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.290
for so long,

00:05:36.466 --> 00:05:37.844
and I've never been to your place.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.050
I'd like to take a look.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.170
Can I?

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.390
Of course.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.510
I haven't had time

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.460
to show you around.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.410
Then...

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.000
I'll show you around.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.140
Sure.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.170
Let's go.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.050
Mrs. Cen.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.460
It's quite spacious.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.850
Not bad.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.170
I like your style.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.170
Bedroom?

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:23.260
Yes, bedroom.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:29.610
Very nice.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
For a guy,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.370
you really keep things tidy.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.140
Yeah.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:38.070
Bathroom?

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.700
Yes, bathroom.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:43.660
Not bad.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.850
I like this style.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.260
Not bad.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.040
Yeah.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.900
Did you go to a wedding with Jin?

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.020
Yes.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.900
Sister said

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.370
she had to attend a client's wedding

00:07:01.377 --> 00:07:02.720
and needed someone to tag along,

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.830
so I went

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:04.970
with her.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.370
Look at her.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.800
She's

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.660
troubling you.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.020
It's not trouble.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:13.020
She always

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.390
looks out for me.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:15.310
Helping her

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.260
is the least I can do.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.610
This shirt is nice.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.850
Cen Jin has one, too.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:35.580
Really?

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.580
This is a basic style.

00:07:38.755 --> 00:07:39.600
Basic white shirt.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.970
Everyone wears it to work.

00:07:42.577 --> 00:07:45.780
I always bump into people
wearing the same thing.

00:07:48.444 --> 00:07:49.644
You get back to your work.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.530
I'll head back.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.160
Pretty good.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.160
I like this place.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:53.510
Right.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:54.700
Let me walk you out, Mrs. Cen.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.660
Well...

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.410
You're only wearing one layer.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:07.850
Aren't your legs cold?

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.660
Where's the button?

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.490
Coming.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:55.820
You're home early today.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.700
No overtime?

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.150
Looks like the system issue

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.320
got fixed.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.460
You're in a good mood.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.510
Have you eaten?

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:02.630
Come with me again.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:03.540
I haven't had dinner.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:13.670
Mom,

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.250
why are you suddenly here?

00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:16.511
You haven't eaten, right?

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:18.970
Come in. I'll cook.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.700
Why didn't you give me a heads-up?

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.030
I gave you the look.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.480
Did you?

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.460
Do you want shrimp?

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.130
Yes. Coming.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:44.220
No.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:45.650
Listen carefully.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.820
I don't agree.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.100
Why not?

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.490
Why not?

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.420
How old are you?

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.340
How old is Li Wu?

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.790
When he was born,

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:58.600
you were old enough

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.370
to run around.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.460
Tell me.

00:10:00.644 --> 00:10:02.130
How am I supposed to agree to this?

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.870
He's an adult.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.060
I'm an adult.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.750
What's wrong

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.030
with two adults dating?

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.600
The problem is that you two adults

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.850
have too big an age gap.

00:10:13.933 --> 00:10:15.355
Besides, your family backgrounds

00:10:15.733 --> 00:10:18.120
and the environments you grew up in

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.180
are completely different.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.840
It's not as simple as you think.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.480
You'll run into

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.420
all kinds of problems
in the future, girl.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.940
Then, we'll deal with them
when they come.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:31.420
Let me ask you.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.320
Why didn't you tell me

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.866
about Dr. Lu going away for training?

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.480
Mom,

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.320
did you

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.220
text him again?

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:40.820
I already explained everything to him.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.840
Besides,

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.580
love isn't just about being compatible.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:45.360
If it were that simple,

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.580
no one would still be single.

00:10:47.711 --> 00:10:48.630
Then why was he

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:49.610
suddenly transferred?

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.370
That's his business.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:54.460
Forget it.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.360
You never listen anyway.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.360
Cook for yourself.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.177
I'm not serving you.

00:10:59.177 --> 00:10:59.888
Mom...

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:00.850
I...

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.720
Don't eat it.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.000
No! Don't eat any of it.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:05.844
I'm taking it away.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.100
I haven't finished eating.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.010
This is infuriating.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:16.490
Cen!

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:19.750
Why did you bring back

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:20.844
the things you gave Jin?

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.420
Don't.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:25.777
Something's happened.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.150
Something really happened.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.060
What happened?

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.370
Cen Jin

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:31.320
and Li Wu.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.820
They are together.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:34.870
Really?

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:35.970
Of course.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.130
Let me be clear.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.180
I will never agree to this.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.730
Calm down first.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.340
Don't get worked up.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.770
It's bad for your health.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.370
Look.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.730
If you ask me,

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:56.970
Jin is a grown-up.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.650
Sometimes,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.180
we parents

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.130
shouldn't control everything.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.650
What do you mean by that?

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.000
You're her father.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.180
How can you be so relaxed?

00:12:08.422 --> 00:12:09.790
You know our family's situation

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:10.770
with Li Wu.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.000
And the age gap between them

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.730
is huge.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.130
Jin will definitely get hurt.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.100
I don't think

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.540
it's that serious.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.250
Not that serious?

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.970
Cen Qiaoyuan.

00:12:29.133 --> 00:12:30.030
Did you know something

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:30.890
beforehand?

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:31.700
This...

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.220
How would I know?

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.460
I just think

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.200
Jin is a grown-up.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.100
She can make her own judgment.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.000
How about this?

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.120
You calm down first.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.820
I'll talk to her later.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:46.420
You talk to her?

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.610
I won't buy that.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.720
You'd probably

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.730
tip her off.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:54.150
I won't.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.180
You absolutely will.

00:12:56.133 --> 00:12:57.480
I've lived with you for so long.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.650
I know you too well.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:00.320
Alright.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.370
Enough about you.

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:03.610
My priority right now

00:13:03.733 --> 00:13:05.222
is to nip whatever is going on

00:13:05.222 --> 00:13:07.100
between them in the bud.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:10.600
You.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.010
Put everything back in the fridge.

00:13:15.784 --> 00:13:17.220
Don't you dare tip off your daughter.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:18.940
I promise we're on the same side.

00:13:19.933 --> 00:13:20.960
You've been busy all day.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.377
You haven't taken your meds, right?

00:13:22.377 --> 00:13:23.555
Want me to bring it?

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.250
What did your mom say?

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:38.630
My mom was talking

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:39.750
out of anger.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:40.850
I didn't take it seriously.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:42.490
Don't ask.

00:13:43.711 --> 00:13:45.444
I'm afraid she'll make things hard
for you.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.320
She's my mom.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.955
Why would she make things hard for me?

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:51.390
Besides,

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.000
you know

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.940
what she's like.

00:13:53.311 --> 00:13:55.511
She says harsh words,
but she doesn't really mean it.

00:13:55.622 --> 00:13:57.422
Everything will be fine
once she cools down.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.370
If I could be more mature,

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:08.580
maybe she wouldn't worry so much.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:11.580
Don't worry.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.130
I'll work on it.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.910
Compared to people your age,

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.250
you're very mature.

00:14:31.911 --> 00:14:33.580
I'm afraid
that if you become more mature,

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:34.970
you'll over-ripen.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:42.610
One second.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.933
(Jin, let's hang out tomorrow.)

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.850
That's my dad, not my mom.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:08.820
(Okay!)

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.510
You know

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:22.866
what you look like right now?

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.060
What?

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.700
When I was a kid
and had to get blood drawn,

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:30.490
I didn't dare look at the needle.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.540
It looks exactly like you now.

00:15:35.355 --> 00:15:37.180
If that's all it was,
I wouldn't be scared.

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:47.490
Cen Jin.

00:15:49.466 --> 00:15:51.250
Why are you suddenly
calling my full name?

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.820
I just wanted to.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.440
Look at your smile.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.340
You look so much better.
Don't always frown.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:07.540
Whatever happens,

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.540
we'll face it together,

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:11.770
alright?

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:23.300
Together.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:01.340
So, what we need to do next is...

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.170
focus on training

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.450
and run the sectional tests.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:10.310
Also,

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:11.480
even though

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.400
we've shown the program

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.070
to Mr. Guo,

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:16.720
during the small-scale internal testing

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.666
these past few days,

00:17:17.688 --> 00:17:19.410
we still found a few issues.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.510
So over the next few days,

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:23.610
I'll need everyone
to patch things up where needed.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:26.400
I'll compile all the problems again,

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.350
and each of you

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:28.410
will handle your own part.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.400
If there are any questions,

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.540
come talk to me anytime.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.310
I'll be doing a final check at the end.

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:33.880
Alright?

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.270
I'll be in the office.
Okay. That's all. We got this.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:37.500
- Thanks, Wu.
- Alright, Wu.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.540
Mr. Li.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.260
Chenyang.

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:54.690
I need to talk to you.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:55.740
What's wrong?

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.540
I want to resign.

00:18:00.933 --> 00:18:02.210
Why are you suddenly resigning?

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.260
I'm sorry, Mr. Li.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:06.780
I'm not capable enough.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.890
I can't handle this job.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:12.820
Chenyang,

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:15.160
you know

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.488
we're short-handed right now.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.820
If you have any issues

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.790
or requests,

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:20.580
tell me.

00:18:20.711 --> 00:18:21.890
I'll try my best to meet them.

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.610
No need.

00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:24.200
I don't have any issues or requests.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:32.690
Alright.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:34.890
But according to the company policy,

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.980
you need to give one month's notice.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.740
We signed this when you joined.

00:18:39.955 --> 00:18:41.444
Besides, you're the tech team leader,

00:18:41.466 --> 00:18:43.019
and there's confidential work involved.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.860
I'll arrange for someone
to take over from you.

00:18:44.866 --> 00:18:45.370
Sure.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.020
Whatever it is.

00:18:58.688 --> 00:18:59.844
Where are you going?

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.980
Why is Zhang Chenyang leaving?

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.060
What's with that face?

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:19.930
He wants to resign.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.410
He's the tech team leader,

00:19:25.444 --> 00:19:26.640
and he suddenly walks away

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.488
at a time like this?

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:28.410
This is strange.

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.450
He's determined to leave.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:33.780
Feels like he has found another job.

00:19:34.866 --> 00:19:36.600
So what are you going to do now?

00:19:37.911 --> 00:19:39.200
We need to hire someone fast.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.288
Do you have enough people?

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:41.070
Of course not.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:41.890
I'll have to hire.

00:19:42.333 --> 00:19:43.750
But whoever comes in at this stage

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:44.850
won't be able to keep up.

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:51.820
The pressure's there.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.440
But we're

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.500
at the final stretch.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.830
It's so close.

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.170
We can't afford mistakes now.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.650
My plan is to get through
all the procedures first.

00:20:04.688 --> 00:20:06.533
Once we secure the investment
from Yuanshi,

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:07.070
the pressure

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.260
should ease a bit.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.500
Alright then.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:12.130
I don't know technology as you do.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.930
I'll do everything to back you up.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.100
Jin, you're here.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:27.920
When did you get here, Dad?

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.930
I just arrived, too.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.619
You see, it's a workday, and I asked you

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.210
to come over.
You must be tired, right?

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:34.340
Not at all.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.410
It's rare that I get to
have a nice meal.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:37.130
Really?

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.100
You should eat more later.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:40.930
Excuse me,

00:20:41.022 --> 00:20:42.244
you can serve the dishes now.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.410
Dad, you already know, right?

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:00.300
Have you seriously decided

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.060
to be with Wu?

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.480
Actually, before he went abroad,

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.820
we had already been together.

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.890
Well...

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:15.930
Sorry.

00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:18.022
I didn't mean to hide it
from you and Mom.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:23.000
At the beginning,

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.980
when I realized he liked me,

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.550
I was conflicted.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:28.100
It's not like I didn't try to resist it.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.210
But gradually,

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.650
he won me over.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:33.030
I really never thought

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:34.020
I'd end up with him.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.580
But feelings are feelings.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.210
If you like someone, you like someone.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.740
I didn't want to lie to myself, right?

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.580
Later, because he didn't want to
be separated from me,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.780
he hid the fact that he wanted
to give up his exchange program.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.370
I found out,

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:52.650
and I broke up with him.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.410
Hence,

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.740
he was really hurt by that.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.370
I didn't know you and Wu

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:04.650
had all that history.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.890
Can you tell me

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.020
what it is about Wu

00:22:14.711 --> 00:22:17.170
that makes you fall in love
with him again?

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:22.540
Dad,

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:25.820
I'm not falling for him again.

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:27.820
I've always

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.020
liked him.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:34.790
I have met

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:36.000
other guys

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.060
over the years.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.370
But only Li Wu

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.580
gives me that kind of strong feeling.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:44.690
How do I put it?

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:47.930
Someone like Lu Weiyan

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.790
is great too.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:51.511
He has a decent job
and good character.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.170
But it's just not the same.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.260
To me, Li Wu

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:57.850
is exactly the kind of love

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.370
I hoped for.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:03.480
Sometimes, he's so good

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.822
that it doesn't even feel real.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:08.210
Every single time,

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:09.740
he's so genuine

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.450
and passionate.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.820
I can't help but fall for that.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.690
Just knowing there's someone

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.890
who will choose me,

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:24.300
no matter what happens,

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.300
that makes me feel very safe.

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:31.340
Dad,

00:23:32.311 --> 00:23:33.980
I don't know
what the future will be like.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.930
But at least

00:23:36.266 --> 00:23:37.450
this is how I feel right now.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:45.370
I'll be frank with you.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:46.790
Before I came,

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:48.410
I was still unsure.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.060
But after hearing what you just said,

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:53.610
my first reaction was

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.020
relief.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.060
I finally

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.650
felt at ease.

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:02.610
Dad, you're not against it?

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.740
What's there to oppose?

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.590
My only hope for you now is

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:10.060
that you're happy.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.480
Whoever can make my daughter happy

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.450
is fine by me.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.260
As for Wu,

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.440
you two were apart for so long

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.690
and still ended up back together.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.240
That means your relationship

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.340
has been tested, right?

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.690
As long as you've thought it through

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.780
and can open your heart to love him

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.610
and also feel happy with him,

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.370
I don't think

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.790
anything is more important

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:42.650
than that.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.510
Dad,

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:46.060
stop being so sentimental.

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:47.450
I'm being sentimental?

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.930
Alright.

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:50.370
I'll stop.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:52.930
I'll stop.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:57.850
Thank you.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.500
Look.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.850
I don't know Wu

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.580
as well as you do,

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:06.740
but from what I've seen,

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.650
he's a good guy.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.650
He's young,

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:14.580
but the way he handles things,

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:16.580
his personality, and his thinking

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:18.060
are steady.

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:20.450
So...

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:23.170
I trust your judgment.

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:25.340
I support your choice.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.160
And more importantly,

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.100
I'm going to

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:31.980
stay right by your side

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.300
and be your strongest backup.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:38.210
Dad, you're the best.

00:25:39.066 --> 00:25:39.850
Let's dig in.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:45.640
As for your mom,

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.780
I'll talk to her.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.000
You know how she is.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:49.980
She's stubborn,

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:51.440
especially

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.260
with the whole thing
about Wu Fu before...

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:54.790
She can't get over it

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:55.510
right away.

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:56.650
That's understandable.

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:58.110
But she

00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:59.260
means well.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.370
She just wants you...

00:26:02.022 --> 00:26:03.540
Well, I'll ladle you some soup first.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.410
She just wants you

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.500
to find someone reliable,

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.020
so it won't be a big problem.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:15.580
You have to understand her.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:17.740
I know, Dad.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.340
I don't mean to make her angry either.

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:21.130
So,

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:24.580
are you sure you can handle her temper?

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.030
We've been married for so many years.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:30.930
My strategy has always been

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.740
turning hard steel into soft silk.

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.200
Everything takes time.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.100
Don't rush it.

00:26:39.111 --> 00:26:40.260
Then, I'm counting on you.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.260
Alright.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.130
I'll ladle some soup.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.340
Try this.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.740
These little fish are good.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.540
Good.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.030
Dad, I'm heading off then.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:55.410
Okay.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.790
Call me when you get home.

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:57.340
Got it.

00:26:58.222 --> 00:26:59.830
Do you want to bring the food home?

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:00.933
You can heat it up tomorrow.

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:01.550
No need.

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:03.044
Mom likes that one. Let her have it.

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:04.070
Okay.

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.540
I'm off.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.270
Be careful on the way.

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:06.780
I will.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.410
Hui,

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.160
look what I bought you

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.210
on the way home.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:05.100
Lin Hui?

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.060
Oh, no!

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:33.450
She's gearing up for a long battle.

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:35.400
Hello, Dad?

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.580
I just got home. Why?

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.020
You're back.

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:43.370
Mom? What are you doing here?

00:29:44.133 --> 00:29:45.400
I'm having a footbath.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.240
I saw online

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.210
that soaking before bed
helps with sleep.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.260
Wait.

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.310
Why didn't you tell me

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:52.690
you were coming?

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.820
Also, your luggage...

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.410
Do I have to file a report

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.422
before coming
to my own daughter's place?

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.440
I just felt like

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.888
you've been too busy lately

00:30:03.933 --> 00:30:06.200
that you don't have time to come home
for dinner.

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:07.580
I thought

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.070
maybe I should move in for a while

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.980
and take care of you.

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:13.890
Stop eating all that instant junk
and takeout.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.200
This is better, isn't it?

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.660
I can cook at home, and when you come back,
you'll have a hot meal.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:18.890
Mom, you don't need to.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.130
My work hours aren't fixed.

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:22.790
My schedule doesn't match

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:23.880
your time at all.

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.550
It's fine.

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:25.650
I'm free anyway.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.340
If you can't make it back,
I'll bring dinner to your office.

00:30:28.733 --> 00:30:29.622
No, don't do that.

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:30.540
I'll come home

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.450
for dinner.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.930
Do you want to soak your feet like me?

00:30:34.222 --> 00:30:35.740
I brought a bunch of herbal packs.

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.740
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:59.260
(Here's something
I want to share with you.)

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.044
(Relationships with big age gaps)

00:31:06.088 --> 00:31:08.400
(often come with very different
worldviews, values,)

00:31:08.422 --> 00:31:09.500
(and life experiences.)

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.466
(Those differences make it hard
to truly understand each other.)

00:31:12.466 --> 00:31:15.980
(In the end,
the relationship usually falls apart.)

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:23.380
(Cen Jin: My mom came.)

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:50.610
(Are you asleep?)

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:02.740
Hello?

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.260
You're off work?

00:32:06.933 --> 00:32:08.210
I just reached downstairs.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.650
Did you argue with your mom?

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.780
No.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.060
Good.

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:17.680
I have good news

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.450
for you.

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:23.020
I met my dad today.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:24.820
He told me

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:26.410
he supports my choice.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.170
As long as I'm happy.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.340
Are you happy?

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:34.060
I am.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.260
I'm happy every day.

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:40.880
Alright.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.920
You must be tired.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.690
Go get some rest.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.060
What if I can't sleep?

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:49.890
Then lie down and rest your eyes.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.690
But I miss you.

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:56.880
We live next door.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.222
No need to be this clingy, right?

00:32:58.244 --> 00:32:58.888
No.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.650
Now that you say that,

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.260
I kind of miss you, too.

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:12.650
Do you want to come out?

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.890
I want to hug you.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.200
Are you crazy?

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.510
Go to sleep.

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:18.740
Just for a bit.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.980
Three minutes.

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:26.370
Are you upstairs now?

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:29.020
Right away.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.770
Let's go to my place.

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:08.860
Okay.

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:17.580
Softly.

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.380
Let's go.

00:35:51.666 --> 00:35:52.580
Where are you going?

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.460
It's 6 AM.

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:56.770
I need to get back
before my mom wakes up.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:58.230
It's only 6 PM.

00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:59.330
Stay with me a bit longer.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.250
Just one minute.

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:04.550
Alright.

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:05.500
Just one minute.

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:07.330
One minute.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.320
By the way,

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:12.590
you've been so busy lately.

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:13.730
Has your headache come back?

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.810
My headaches are gone.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:18.100
Are you still taking the meds?

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.840
I'm alright now.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:22.980
Why would I take meds?

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:24.730
You're my meds.

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:27.510
I'm serious.

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:28.580
Don't joke around.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.420
I'm serious too.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.810
My headaches are gone.

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:44.920
Alright, time's up.

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:45.580
I have to go.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.280
If my mom wakes up,

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:47.940
I'm done for.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:05.730
Bye-bye.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.460
Bye-bye.

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:41.860
You're up this early?

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.480
Mom,

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:44.690
why do you walk like a cat?

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.060
No sound at all.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:46.960
What?

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.844
Should I bang gongs and drums
when I walk?

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.770
You...

00:37:51.777 --> 00:37:52.690
What are you doing?

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.690
I went out for a morning run.

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:56.940
Morning run?

00:37:58.070 --> 00:37:58.960
I didn't know

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:00.130
you had such a good habit.

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.280
I have plenty of good habits.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.380
You just don't know them.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.330
Go ahead then.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.060
I just got back.

00:38:08.088 --> 00:38:09.577
I'm getting changed for work.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.980
Wu.

00:38:20.111 --> 00:38:20.690
Good morning.

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:25.290
Wu.

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:26.210
Wu.

00:38:26.377 --> 00:38:27.060
Good morning.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.420
Chenyang didn't come to work?

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.500
No.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.020
Li Wu!

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:35.460
What's wrong?

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:36.250
Come here.

00:38:47.444 --> 00:38:48.911
Take a look at yourself.

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:56.880
(AI Environmental System Launch Event)
(Kejun is launching a new system,)

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.190
(which uses AI environmental
protection technology)

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:03.380
(as support for industrial parks,)

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:05.550
(hospitals, high-end hotels,)

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:07.480
(and many other facilities.)

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.130
(Currently,)

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.210
(in the domestic)

00:39:09.533 --> 00:39:11.466
(environmental protection
monitoring industry,)

00:39:11.533 --> 00:39:13.510
(this is a major technological
breakthrough.)

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:14.110
Isn't this

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:14.900
our core technology?

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:16.000
How did Kejun

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:16.900
get to launch it first?

00:39:28.911 --> 00:39:30.840
(Tongchen Trio)
(Hu Yi: Just letting you two know.)

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.360
(Due to a divergence in our management,)

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:34.230
(I've decided to withdraw my shares
from Tongchen.)

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:35.210
(My lawyer will handle)

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.630
(the follow-up matters)

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:37.460
(with you.)

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.230
Why did he quit now,

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:42.250
of all times?

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.330
Don't tell me he's behind this.

00:39:47.377 --> 00:39:49.466
But he doesn't know anything
about technology.

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:50.290
Zhang Chenyang.

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.770
Zhang Chenyang?

00:39:58.070 --> 00:39:59.500
No wonder he resigned.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.710
I didn't expect those two pricks

00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:02.733
to stab us in the back.

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:07.820
(Considering the cost issues,
including two-way data and distributed.)

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:10.610
How is it, Lawyer Li?

00:40:10.711 --> 00:40:12.060
Can we sue them for infringement?

00:40:13.555 --> 00:40:15.840
You haven't completed
the patent application process yet.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.290
So technically,

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.500
it's hard to prove

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:21.290
they stole your CloudMap system.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.440
But we have

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.800
the full R&D documentation.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.900
Everything is timestamped.

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:28.280
Plus, it's obvious

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.460
that Yi is behind this.

00:40:29.533 --> 00:40:31.355
Call him over.
I'll confront him in person!

00:40:31.377 --> 00:40:32.290
Alright.

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:33.800
Calm down first.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.610
This isn't the time to vent.

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:37.420
I understand how you feel.

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:40.000
But this timing

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.130
is really tricky.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.210
They clearly knew
this was their best chance.

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:46.650
If you decide to sue,

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:47.710
you need to be ready

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:48.940
for a long fight.

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:51.330
How long?

00:40:51.377 --> 00:40:52.800
It may take one to two years,

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.020
or...

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:56.810
Even three to five years.

00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:58.900
So during that time,

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:00.550
we can't do anything

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:01.810
or release our product?

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:04.210
Can we put out a statement?

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.130
I don't recommend it.

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:08.130
Public opinion can backfire.

00:41:08.222 --> 00:41:10.110
And you're in the middle
of securing investment.

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:13.170
If they bite back,
things could spiral out of control.

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:31.340
(Notice of Yuanshi Capital's Withdrawal
from Tongchen Smart System Project)

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.130
Hello, Mr. Guo?

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.540
Mr. Guo?

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:48.610
Look,

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.290
here's the thing.

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:52.190
We'd like to

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:54.110
explain the situation to you in person.

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:55.400
I'm not sure if you're available.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.250
That's alright. Tomorrow is fine.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.550
Or the day after?

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:00.755
Yes, the day after is fine too.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.540
Yes, I understand.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:07.280
Yes.

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.440
This is our fault.

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.320
But I promise

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.690
we'll handle it properly.

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:12.170
I hope

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:13.980
you can give us another chance.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:26.690
I understand.

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:31.690
Alright.

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:35.170
Well...

00:42:35.955 --> 00:42:38.060
I hope we can
work together again in the future.

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:43.100
Sure.

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.980
Yuanshi Capital?

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.100
They're pulling out.

00:42:58.280 --> 00:42:59.940
The only good news is

00:43:00.333 --> 00:43:01.730
they won't hold us accountable.

00:43:03.044 --> 00:43:04.670
I'll ask my uncle, see if he can help.

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:05.210
No, no.

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:06.550
Yiyang

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:07.540
has helped us enough.

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:09.170
Don't bother him anymore.

00:43:10.244 --> 00:43:11.730
We'll figure something out ourselves.
