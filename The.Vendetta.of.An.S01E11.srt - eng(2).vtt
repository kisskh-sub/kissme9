00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:01.705
All four regional military commanders
enter the Capital tomorrow.

00:02:02.905 --> 00:02:04.305
Once they enter the Capital,

00:02:04.385 --> 00:02:06.225
they must surely know
that they face the danger

00:02:06.305 --> 00:02:08.744
of losing military authority.

00:02:09.385 --> 00:02:11.105
They won't submit easily.

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:17.425
Let's take a guess

00:02:17.505 --> 00:02:19.025
at the kinds of plots
they'll come up with.

00:02:19.865 --> 00:02:20.865
How much can we guess?

00:02:24.145 --> 00:02:25.305
Where's Gu Yu?

00:02:25.385 --> 00:02:26.465
Can he make it in time?

00:02:28.665 --> 00:02:32.425
Xie Huai'an is already
preparing a rescue plan.

00:02:33.505 --> 00:02:34.985
He's out of our control.

00:02:36.105 --> 00:02:37.465
We can't predict his moves.

00:02:43.105 --> 00:02:44.865
Back in the day,

00:02:46.225 --> 00:02:49.185
we were able to anticipate many things.

00:02:50.145 --> 00:02:52.145
Same for this military campaign
against Chang'an.

00:02:52.225 --> 00:02:55.385
We also knew that the useless soldiers

00:02:55.465 --> 00:02:57.625
under my brother's command

00:02:57.705 --> 00:02:59.025
were unable to hold the city gates.

00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:01.505
Now that we've won ourselves an empire,

00:03:02.185 --> 00:03:03.345
it feels the further we go,

00:03:03.945 --> 00:03:07.665
the more uncertainties we'll face.

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:12.905
Perhaps, as the saying goes,

00:03:14.225 --> 00:03:15.465
"It's easier to seize power

00:03:16.545 --> 00:03:17.905
than to hold onto it."

00:04:53.665 --> 00:04:55.945
How's the situation outside?

00:04:59.145 --> 00:05:01.785
The four commanders have arrived,
moving discreetly.

00:05:02.825 --> 00:05:04.145
Luckily, Xiaoqing was able to find out.

00:05:06.065 --> 00:05:07.305
Do you truly think

00:05:07.385 --> 00:05:10.265
Gao Yan, Xiao Wuyang, and the rest
plan to strike the commanders?

00:05:11.385 --> 00:05:13.305
They will, if we fail to rescue Gu Yu

00:05:14.465 --> 00:05:15.545
in time.

00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:20.105
Instead of letting the commanders
align themselves with the Huben Army,

00:05:20.185 --> 00:05:23.065
we should kill them first.

00:05:24.225 --> 00:05:25.745
With Chancellor Gao's capabilities,

00:05:26.505 --> 00:05:28.585
he would pacify the four towns

00:05:28.665 --> 00:05:30.345
while cutting down the commanders.

00:05:31.105 --> 00:05:33.985
Perhaps he has already dispatched his men.

00:05:35.305 --> 00:05:36.745
Now that Gu Yu is captured,

00:05:36.825 --> 00:05:39.145
undercurrents are stirring once more
under the city of Chang'an.

00:05:39.225 --> 00:05:40.385
As for Gu Yu,

00:05:41.585 --> 00:05:42.585
I've already found him.

00:05:45.145 --> 00:05:46.105
You found him?

00:05:46.945 --> 00:05:47.825
We should act, then.

00:05:47.905 --> 00:05:49.465
A war will start in the city, you know?

00:05:50.625 --> 00:05:51.825
Let's wait a little longer.

00:05:51.905 --> 00:05:53.705
I have something else in mind.

00:05:56.465 --> 00:05:59.305
Hand this to Chancellor Gao.

00:06:00.105 --> 00:06:02.905
He'll hold his position
once he reads this.

00:06:02.985 --> 00:06:05.105
-Can I read this?
-Of course.

00:06:05.825 --> 00:06:07.785
I'm just worried
that you cannot understand it.

00:06:08.865 --> 00:06:09.705
I won't read it, then.

00:06:11.505 --> 00:06:13.265
Tell the pageboy to keep a close eye
on Wang Xing.

00:06:13.345 --> 00:06:14.985
Is he doing things properly?

00:06:17.105 --> 00:06:18.065
It's a long story.

00:06:18.145 --> 00:06:19.585
But I'll summarize it.

00:06:20.585 --> 00:06:22.025
He has already done Wang Xing in.

00:06:24.945 --> 00:06:26.505
But it wasn't not his fault.

00:06:26.585 --> 00:06:28.545
Anyway, you should stop worrying.

00:06:28.625 --> 00:06:30.745
Finish your task inside.
We'll talk once you're out.

00:06:32.105 --> 00:06:32.945
All right.

00:06:42.025 --> 00:06:43.345
Make way!

00:06:47.065 --> 00:06:49.225
Watch where you're going!

00:06:50.905 --> 00:06:52.545
Mother, we have a customer.

00:06:53.105 --> 00:06:54.185
A customer?

00:06:54.745 --> 00:06:58.905
-If so, get him some food later, okay?
-Miss. Get me two buns.

00:06:58.985 --> 00:07:00.345
Coming right up.

00:07:05.465 --> 00:07:06.505
It's hot. Be careful.

00:07:13.905 --> 00:07:17.025
Eat up. My mother's buns are delicious.

00:07:19.545 --> 00:07:21.945
What about your father?

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:23.865
I don't remember who my father is.

00:07:23.945 --> 00:07:26.665
Mother said it's been three years
since he last returned.

00:07:26.745 --> 00:07:27.785
My wife

00:07:28.385 --> 00:07:32.185
often wears a purple dress,
faded from all the washing.

00:07:35.345 --> 00:07:37.145
You'll know when you see her.

00:07:41.785 --> 00:07:47.945
LIU'S BAMBOO SHOP

00:08:05.185 --> 00:08:06.185
‎Come on.

00:08:06.265 --> 00:08:07.905
I'll make you something nice
when we're back.

00:08:11.225 --> 00:08:13.625
-Mother, are you tired?
-Not at all.

00:08:25.985 --> 00:08:26.905
Young lady.

00:08:29.305 --> 00:08:30.385
Young lady.

00:08:32.385 --> 00:08:33.745
Young lady.

00:08:33.825 --> 00:08:34.985
Young lady.

00:08:40.065 --> 00:08:41.065
Young lady.

00:08:41.144 --> 00:08:42.865
Young lady, open up.

00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:46.425
Stop hiding.

00:08:46.505 --> 00:08:49.665
I just want to help you guys out.

00:08:49.745 --> 00:08:51.185
It's already been two months.

00:08:51.265 --> 00:08:53.065
Why are you still avoiding me?

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:54.825
I know

00:08:54.905 --> 00:08:58.185
that your shop is right here.

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:00.625
Your daughter is still very young.

00:09:00.705 --> 00:09:02.225
And you're alone.

00:09:02.305 --> 00:09:03.665
You have only two eyes.

00:09:03.745 --> 00:09:05.425
You won't be able
to watch her every moment.

00:09:05.505 --> 00:09:07.625
Mother. I'm scared.

00:09:09.625 --> 00:09:10.905
I'm here for you.

00:09:13.385 --> 00:09:14.105
Young lady!

00:09:14.745 --> 00:09:16.185
Young lady, open the door!

00:09:45.505 --> 00:09:48.425
Mother. Let's call Father back.

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:51.145
-Let's call Father back.
-Okay.

00:09:51.225 --> 00:09:52.785
I'll write to your father now.

00:09:52.865 --> 00:09:54.425
I'll ask him to return at once, all right?

00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:56.345
Stop crying.

00:10:12.185 --> 00:10:14.105
Mister. I want a bowl of noodles.

00:10:14.185 --> 00:10:15.105
Give me extra vegetables.

00:10:15.705 --> 00:10:17.705
‎Please cut some raddish for me.

00:10:17.785 --> 00:10:19.145
-I'll come back for it later.
-Okay.

00:10:30.425 --> 00:10:33.345
Say, you still have a habit of being late
even after all these years, huh?

00:10:34.385 --> 00:10:35.505
Lamb won't be as tasty

00:10:35.585 --> 00:10:37.465
if you cook it for too long.

00:10:38.985 --> 00:10:40.425
Are we here just to eat lamb?

00:10:41.145 --> 00:10:43.585
Didn't we return to Chang'an
to devour other people?

00:10:43.665 --> 00:10:45.345
Not necessarily.

00:10:45.425 --> 00:10:47.945
If we do a bad job,
we'll be devoured instead.

00:10:52.185 --> 00:10:54.505
Can you guys talk about something
that won't spoil my appetite?

00:10:55.945 --> 00:10:57.385
If I'm not mistaken,

00:10:57.465 --> 00:10:59.385
when we followed the founding emperor
into Chang'an,

00:10:59.465 --> 00:11:01.065
we had our first meal here.

00:11:01.145 --> 00:11:03.505
No wonder you settled here
after searching everywhere.

00:11:03.585 --> 00:11:06.425
Thirty years ago, after that meal,
we followed the founding emperor

00:11:07.385 --> 00:11:08.865
into the palace.

00:11:09.665 --> 00:11:11.105
He conquered the empire

00:11:12.025 --> 00:11:13.625
while we seized the military seals.

00:11:14.585 --> 00:11:15.585
I told you already.

00:11:16.185 --> 00:11:17.785
This is a lucky spot.

00:11:18.385 --> 00:11:20.265
But 30 years passed
in the blink of an eye.

00:11:20.865 --> 00:11:22.465
The founding emperor is long gone.

00:11:22.545 --> 00:11:26.465
And now, his son
wants to take back our military seals.

00:11:28.505 --> 00:11:30.385
If we agree to it,

00:11:30.465 --> 00:11:31.705
it'll mean

00:11:32.305 --> 00:11:34.345
that our lifetime will be in vain.

00:11:36.465 --> 00:11:39.185
Is there really no room for maneuver
in this matter?

00:11:42.225 --> 00:11:43.745
Our lives may not be in vain after all.

00:11:44.345 --> 00:11:47.265
If that does happen,
at least I still own this alley.

00:11:52.105 --> 00:11:55.265
A few years ago,
I spent some money and bought this alley.

00:11:55.345 --> 00:11:58.465
The lamb we're having
is served by my shop.

00:11:59.465 --> 00:12:00.985
You're something else indeed.

00:12:01.065 --> 00:12:03.025
-You're a cunning old fox.
-You are hogging all the food.

00:12:41.545 --> 00:12:43.785
-Have all of their men arrived?
-They have.

00:12:44.385 --> 00:12:45.425
What about our men?

00:12:45.505 --> 00:12:46.585
Our men have arrived as well.

00:12:46.665 --> 00:12:48.265
Chancellor, we await your command.

00:12:51.745 --> 00:12:54.505
On the night of murder,
one should savor tea to the fullest.

00:13:03.465 --> 00:13:05.785
ABUNDANT FORTUNE

00:13:21.185 --> 00:13:23.505
You're not acting yourself today.

00:13:24.105 --> 00:13:26.305
You see, it's a long story.

00:13:26.385 --> 00:13:27.785
Consider this my penance.

00:13:31.305 --> 00:13:34.385
Your expression, tone,
and the way you act…

00:13:35.945 --> 00:13:37.625
You look more like a hired blade.

00:13:37.705 --> 00:13:39.865
Those who don't know might think
that you're one of my peers.

00:13:39.945 --> 00:13:42.385
So, why are we meeting here?

00:13:42.985 --> 00:13:45.505
Now, I just want to go home
and have a bowl of hot porridge.

00:13:46.185 --> 00:13:47.185
Forget about the porridge.

00:13:49.385 --> 00:13:50.465
Let's have some hot tea.

00:13:54.105 --> 00:13:55.785
Tonight, Chancellor Gao
will make his move here.

00:13:55.865 --> 00:13:57.225
He means to kill the four commanders.

00:13:59.145 --> 00:13:59.985
What?

00:14:00.065 --> 00:14:01.225
Don't act so surprised.

00:14:01.305 --> 00:14:04.145
Our current mission
is to prevent that from happening.

00:14:06.705 --> 00:14:09.705
Chancellor Gao
is having tea in that tea house now.

00:14:09.785 --> 00:14:10.985
The commanders

00:14:11.505 --> 00:14:13.385
are having lamb hotpot in that very alley.

00:14:14.745 --> 00:14:15.985
And us? Must we just

00:14:16.945 --> 00:14:17.985
stand here like fools?

00:14:23.265 --> 00:14:24.425
Take this to Chancellor Gao.

00:14:24.505 --> 00:14:26.985
Huai'an said Chancellor Gao
would stop his operation immediately

00:14:27.065 --> 00:14:27.945
after seeing this.

00:14:34.785 --> 00:14:35.785
Why not go yourself?

00:14:36.465 --> 00:14:37.785
Chancellor Gao has set a trap inside.

00:14:37.865 --> 00:14:39.745
I'm sure there are many assassins
lying in wait.

00:14:39.825 --> 00:14:42.065
I have to locate the assassins first.

00:14:42.145 --> 00:14:43.265
What if something goes wrong?

00:14:43.945 --> 00:14:45.145
Can you fend them off?

00:14:46.345 --> 00:14:47.185
You're right.

00:14:57.105 --> 00:14:59.025
-Can you understand it?
-Of course.

00:14:59.945 --> 00:15:00.945
This is a huge deal.

00:15:01.705 --> 00:15:03.425
Chancellor Gao will stop at once
if he hears this.

00:15:06.625 --> 00:15:07.585
Keep this safe.

00:15:07.665 --> 00:15:08.785
Huai'an said His Majesty

00:15:08.865 --> 00:15:11.185
gave him the Marquis of Wuyang's
official seal himself.

00:15:11.265 --> 00:15:14.145
With it, one can move freely
throughout Chang'an.

00:15:21.105 --> 00:15:22.425
That's Chancellor Gao's messenger.

00:15:23.625 --> 00:15:26.145
They'll commence the operation soon.
I have to stop them.

00:15:28.705 --> 00:15:29.545
Don't mess this up.

00:15:30.905 --> 00:15:31.945
Hey!

00:15:32.025 --> 00:15:32.865
I…

00:15:36.665 --> 00:15:37.745
The tea house?

00:15:38.865 --> 00:15:40.465
Where is it?

00:15:43.545 --> 00:15:46.385
HALL OF TALENT

00:15:53.305 --> 00:15:55.185
According to Chancellor Gao,
tonight is the night…

00:15:56.865 --> 00:15:58.185
Who are you?

00:15:58.265 --> 00:16:00.705
According to Chancellor Gao, all of you

00:16:01.585 --> 00:16:02.945
have to remain here tonight.

00:16:11.745 --> 00:16:12.785
That darned Ye Zheng.

00:16:13.345 --> 00:16:14.665
He only gave me a direction.

00:16:15.185 --> 00:16:17.625
He didn't give me
the tea house's exact location.

00:16:17.705 --> 00:16:18.545
I…

00:16:23.945 --> 00:16:25.665
-Who's there?
-Who's there?

00:16:25.745 --> 00:16:27.825
I wish you all prosperity.

00:16:34.065 --> 00:16:35.345
LONGSHENG INN

00:16:51.185 --> 00:16:52.105
Who's there?

00:16:59.105 --> 00:17:00.265
I bear the Marquis of Wuyang's seal.

00:17:00.345 --> 00:17:01.225
I must see the chancellor.

00:17:05.385 --> 00:17:07.224
Chancellor, someone came with the seal
His Majesty had given.

00:17:07.305 --> 00:17:08.825
-He says it's urgent…
-Get out of the way.

00:17:09.585 --> 00:17:12.145
I came to tell you
not to kill the commanders.

00:17:12.224 --> 00:17:13.464
But now I must tell you

00:17:13.545 --> 00:17:14.905
they mean to kill you.

00:17:14.985 --> 00:17:16.825
Therefore, you have to escape.

00:17:20.505 --> 00:17:21.825
In just one night,

00:17:22.825 --> 00:17:25.704
you managed to uncover two deadly plots.

00:17:28.224 --> 00:17:29.425
Who are you?

00:17:31.785 --> 00:17:33.905
I'm Mr. Xie Huai'an's pageboy.

00:17:33.985 --> 00:17:35.105
This seal is the proof.

00:17:38.425 --> 00:17:41.225
Xie Huai'an is remarkably intelligent.

00:17:41.305 --> 00:17:42.705
It seems the pageboy he has chosen

00:17:43.825 --> 00:17:45.225
is pretty intelligent as well.

00:17:48.065 --> 00:17:50.825
How did you find out
that they were after my life?

00:17:51.985 --> 00:17:53.945
Their hitmen
are waiting at the tavern right next door.

00:17:54.025 --> 00:17:56.665
All of them carried military blades.
I could tell at first glance.

00:18:00.865 --> 00:18:02.465
LONGSHENG INN

00:18:08.825 --> 00:18:10.025
I suppose it's time.

00:18:10.105 --> 00:18:12.505
They should be acting as we speak.

00:18:14.785 --> 00:18:16.425
You guys don't need to be that nervous.

00:18:17.665 --> 00:18:20.425
After all, our target is Gao Yan.

00:18:41.625 --> 00:18:43.025
How can you sit here drinking tea?

00:18:43.705 --> 00:18:45.265
Hurry and escape!

00:18:49.825 --> 00:18:51.945
Wait. Did you know about this long ago?

00:18:57.105 --> 00:18:58.465
You're cunning, aren't you?

00:18:59.625 --> 00:19:00.905
You held back.

00:19:00.985 --> 00:19:02.065
Let them make the first move.

00:19:02.145 --> 00:19:04.225
Now you have grounds to act in the open.

00:19:05.065 --> 00:19:06.145
Am I right?

00:19:08.625 --> 00:19:09.865
You are indeed intelligent.

00:19:13.705 --> 00:19:14.545
But…

00:19:15.705 --> 00:19:17.305
But my men

00:19:17.385 --> 00:19:19.225
have subdued all of your men.

00:19:21.305 --> 00:19:22.905
If so,

00:19:22.985 --> 00:19:26.905
does that mean your plan won't succeed?

00:19:41.105 --> 00:19:43.785
No matter what,
the commanders' hitmen will arrive soon.

00:19:43.865 --> 00:19:45.225
We'd better make a run for it.

00:19:46.905 --> 00:19:47.745
I'm not leaving.

00:19:50.745 --> 00:19:52.105
If I leave, it means I yield.

00:19:53.465 --> 00:19:55.705
Old people like us hate losing, you know?

00:19:55.785 --> 00:19:57.865
What are you saying?
What exactly do you want?

00:19:57.945 --> 00:19:59.825
You won't get to leave
when they arrive, you know?

00:19:59.905 --> 00:20:01.265
Your men

00:20:02.105 --> 00:20:04.865
have subdued my men,
causing my plan to be thwarted.

00:20:04.945 --> 00:20:07.465
And now, I'm in danger because of you.

00:20:07.545 --> 00:20:11.145
You should be the one
coming up with a solution for me.

00:20:16.425 --> 00:20:18.025
Do you want me to find you a way out?

00:20:20.745 --> 00:20:21.825
Are you sure about that?

00:20:31.945 --> 00:20:34.225
Help!

00:20:34.305 --> 00:20:37.065
Someone's trying to kill
the regional military commanders!

00:20:37.705 --> 00:20:39.025
Help!

00:20:39.745 --> 00:20:42.065
Someone's trying to kill
the regional military commanders!

00:20:42.145 --> 00:20:43.785
Help!

00:20:44.385 --> 00:20:47.825
Regional military commanders, run away!

00:20:47.905 --> 00:20:49.705
Someone's after your lives!

00:20:49.785 --> 00:20:51.505
Run away!

00:20:51.585 --> 00:20:54.265
Someone's trying to
kill the regional military commanders!

00:20:55.105 --> 00:20:58.105
Regional military commanders, run away!

00:20:58.185 --> 00:21:00.025
-Someone's after your lives!
-What is he up to?

00:21:01.345 --> 00:21:04.025
Someone's trying to kill
the regional military commanders!

00:21:04.105 --> 00:21:06.105
Regional military commanders, run away!

00:21:06.185 --> 00:21:07.825
Did you give them the wrong order?

00:21:08.345 --> 00:21:10.865
Do I look that foolish to you?

00:21:10.945 --> 00:21:12.225
This seems like…

00:21:12.305 --> 00:21:13.945
It's a trap laid by Gao Yan.

00:21:14.465 --> 00:21:15.945
He's trying to kill us.

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:55.385
This is what we call a feint attack.

00:21:56.905 --> 00:21:59.465
I assume the hitmen have rushed back
to rescue their commanders.

00:22:10.865 --> 00:22:11.945
Chancellor,

00:22:12.025 --> 00:22:14.065
we've already dealt
with the hitmen outside.

00:22:18.785 --> 00:22:19.945
What about the four main targets?

00:22:20.025 --> 00:22:21.185
Don't worry.

00:22:21.945 --> 00:22:23.705
Our men are keeping an eye on them.

00:22:25.865 --> 00:22:27.625
-Time to get to work.
-No, you mustn't!

00:22:31.385 --> 00:22:32.585
Yan Fengshan is returning to the Capital.

00:22:32.665 --> 00:22:34.705
I assume to bargain with the commanders.

00:22:34.785 --> 00:22:36.065
If you kill them now,

00:22:36.145 --> 00:22:38.185
we'll have no bait to lure
Yan Fengshan back.

00:22:54.425 --> 00:22:55.465
This is my proof.

00:23:03.465 --> 00:23:04.305
My master, Xie Huai'an,

00:23:05.305 --> 00:23:08.225
is already coming up
with a way to deal with Yan Fengshan.

00:23:17.105 --> 00:23:18.065
Your Majesty,

00:23:18.825 --> 00:23:19.825
you should be the one

00:23:20.465 --> 00:23:21.865
who makes the call.

00:23:34.505 --> 00:23:36.225
‎EXQUISITE DELICACIES

00:23:51.425 --> 00:23:53.785
I suppose a young man like you
is still filled with fear

00:23:54.425 --> 00:23:56.225
when you see the ruler of the land.

00:24:00.665 --> 00:24:01.505
Raise your head.

00:24:08.305 --> 00:24:10.145
Nothing is more important

00:24:10.825 --> 00:24:12.785
than killing Yan Fengshan.

00:24:13.705 --> 00:24:14.545
Understood?

00:24:17.985 --> 00:24:18.825
Do you understand?

00:24:24.465 --> 00:24:28.425
I… I'm done here.

00:24:29.105 --> 00:24:30.225
I'll make a move.

00:24:50.825 --> 00:24:52.225
After all these years,

00:24:52.945 --> 00:24:54.785
to think that you're the first person

00:24:54.865 --> 00:24:57.545
to come within five steps of my reach

00:24:58.905 --> 00:25:00.145
with a weapon on you.

00:25:01.545 --> 00:25:03.625
It seems we're too careless.

00:25:04.225 --> 00:25:05.185
Indeed.

00:25:06.545 --> 00:25:07.425
Even the best plans have flaws.

00:25:18.705 --> 00:25:20.105
Go!

00:25:23.585 --> 00:25:24.745
What's the situation?

00:25:24.825 --> 00:25:27.025
Every man we sent after Chancellor Gao
is dead.

00:25:27.105 --> 00:25:28.465
However,

00:25:29.225 --> 00:25:31.425
his men posted outside have pulled back.

00:25:33.585 --> 00:25:35.065
It is finally over.

00:25:35.145 --> 00:25:36.465
That was a close shave.

00:25:37.065 --> 00:25:38.505
If that person hadn't shouted for help,

00:25:38.585 --> 00:25:40.425
we'd have thought
everything was under control.

00:25:40.505 --> 00:25:41.785
We almost fell for his trap.

00:25:42.385 --> 00:25:44.225
If I must say,

00:25:44.305 --> 00:25:46.225
we're not really good at coming up
with schemes either.

00:25:46.825 --> 00:25:49.105
Am I right, Wang Pu?

00:25:59.585 --> 00:26:01.025
If they dare move against you,

00:26:01.705 --> 00:26:02.905
they'll dare move against me.

00:26:02.985 --> 00:26:06.425
The four of them would never
dare such boldness on their own.

00:26:07.385 --> 00:26:08.225
Indeed.

00:26:09.105 --> 00:26:10.105
In my opinion,

00:26:10.185 --> 00:26:11.465
it'll be better to kill them

00:26:11.545 --> 00:26:14.225
than to let them ally themselves
with the Huben Army.

00:26:14.305 --> 00:26:15.145
Now, it seems like

00:26:15.225 --> 00:26:18.385
the covenant between them
has long been established.

00:26:22.305 --> 00:26:24.465
Right now, only two things

00:26:24.545 --> 00:26:25.825
can change the current situation.

00:26:27.065 --> 00:26:29.545
Either Gu Yu staying alive or

00:26:30.665 --> 00:26:32.585
Yan Fengshan dying.

00:26:35.785 --> 00:26:37.025
We should leave both tasks

00:26:38.305 --> 00:26:39.905
to White Hair.

00:26:47.065 --> 00:26:48.545
General Gao, you have great foresight.

00:26:50.065 --> 00:26:51.985
I would've bought this alley as well

00:26:52.985 --> 00:26:54.625
if I were as rich as you all.

00:26:54.705 --> 00:26:56.545
You're young and talented.

00:26:56.625 --> 00:27:00.305
You might end up
owning half of the city in the future.

00:27:01.385 --> 00:27:02.825
You're still in the mood to eat?

00:27:02.905 --> 00:27:06.105
Now, we've already fallen out
with Xiao Wuyang.

00:27:06.185 --> 00:27:08.465
I'll see what else you've got planned.

00:27:12.585 --> 00:27:13.545
I've nothing else planned.

00:27:15.785 --> 00:27:17.865
But, you don't need to panic.

00:27:18.665 --> 00:27:19.945
Up next,

00:27:20.025 --> 00:27:21.985
General Fengshan will soon
join the fray himself.

00:27:27.785 --> 00:27:28.985
Please look forward

00:27:30.425 --> 00:27:31.945
to it.

00:27:42.185 --> 00:27:43.345
Thank you.

00:27:44.625 --> 00:27:47.105
You accepted Gu Yu's recommendation
to go to the Capital back then.

00:27:47.185 --> 00:27:48.545
According to the plan,

00:27:48.625 --> 00:27:51.305
I assume you'll be sparing Xiao Wenjing.

00:27:51.385 --> 00:27:52.225
Indeed.

00:27:53.105 --> 00:27:54.465
Why is that?

00:27:54.545 --> 00:27:56.585
It's because of a misunderstanding.

00:27:57.345 --> 00:27:58.305
A misunderstanding?

00:28:05.745 --> 00:28:08.665
The current emperor
is weak and incompetent.

00:28:10.545 --> 00:28:12.985
He might as well
not have taken the throne.

00:28:13.905 --> 00:28:15.385
He should

00:28:16.545 --> 00:28:19.025
become a scholar instead.

00:28:19.905 --> 00:28:21.225
That's right!

00:28:23.065 --> 00:28:24.985
He doesn't even have the freedom
to choose.

00:28:25.065 --> 00:28:26.585
If he had the freedom to choose,

00:28:27.185 --> 00:28:29.745
perhaps he wouldn't have wanted
to be the emperor.

00:28:31.425 --> 00:28:32.385
What a poor soul.

00:28:33.465 --> 00:28:34.705
What a poor soul!

00:28:35.625 --> 00:28:37.865
To the poor soul called the emperor.

00:28:40.785 --> 00:28:41.745
Come!

00:28:43.105 --> 00:28:45.185
To the poor soul called the emperor!

00:28:45.745 --> 00:28:47.185
To him!

00:29:06.265 --> 00:29:07.225
What are you doing?

00:29:07.305 --> 00:29:08.425
What are you doing?

00:29:08.505 --> 00:29:09.665
Yan Fengshan,

00:29:09.745 --> 00:29:11.665
didn't you say
that I could enjoy myself outside

00:29:11.745 --> 00:29:13.225
for two hours each month?

00:29:13.305 --> 00:29:14.785
Has it even been two hours?

00:29:20.825 --> 00:29:22.705
I want to drink more!

00:29:23.625 --> 00:29:26.105
I haven't had my fill yet.

00:29:26.185 --> 00:29:27.505
I don't want to go back!

00:29:27.585 --> 00:29:28.425
I won't go back!

00:29:28.505 --> 00:29:30.185
I want to keep drinking!

00:29:30.265 --> 00:29:31.545
I want to keep drinking!

00:29:31.625 --> 00:29:33.105
I want to keep drinking!

00:29:33.945 --> 00:29:35.305
I don't want to go back!

00:29:39.905 --> 00:29:41.225
Only then did I find out

00:29:41.865 --> 00:29:44.185
that he was suppressed by
Yan Fengshan all along.

00:29:44.265 --> 00:29:45.785
Although he was the emperor,

00:29:46.505 --> 00:29:48.985
in reality, he was just a bird
living in a cage.

00:29:52.785 --> 00:29:53.945
After that,

00:29:54.665 --> 00:29:56.705
I went through many of his manuscripts.

00:29:56.785 --> 00:29:58.425
These four lines
left a deep impression on me.

00:29:59.465 --> 00:30:00.705
"For those who would be ministers,

00:30:00.785 --> 00:30:02.785
discern right from wrong,
heed not gain or loss."

00:30:02.865 --> 00:30:05.185
"For those who would be soldiers,
hold realm and kin above all,

00:30:05.265 --> 00:30:06.425
count not life or death."

00:30:06.505 --> 00:30:07.785
"For those who would be sovereign,

00:30:07.865 --> 00:30:09.785
hear the people's woes,
seek not glory nor splendor."

00:30:10.585 --> 00:30:13.225
"And for those
who would be common folk,

00:30:13.305 --> 00:30:14.505
keep to their fields and livelihood,

00:30:14.585 --> 00:30:15.425
fret not over prices."

00:30:15.505 --> 00:30:17.225
Especially the last part.

00:30:17.865 --> 00:30:19.265
Although his writing wasn't refined,

00:30:19.865 --> 00:30:23.425
from it, I could tell
that he cared for his people.

00:30:25.345 --> 00:30:27.305
He wrote those
when he was the crown prince.

00:30:28.265 --> 00:30:30.105
He wrote them
with an innocent heart back then.

00:30:31.025 --> 00:30:32.145
What a shame.

00:30:32.825 --> 00:30:35.105
He proved to be too soft
after ascending the throne.

00:30:35.185 --> 00:30:36.905
He was suppressed by Yan Fengshan
for many years.

00:30:37.545 --> 00:30:39.465
He was unable to establish a peaceful era.

00:30:42.225 --> 00:30:43.625
Times have changed indeed.

00:30:44.345 --> 00:30:45.465
Now,

00:30:45.545 --> 00:30:48.105
there probably isn't anyone
who wants him to remain emperor.

00:30:49.345 --> 00:30:50.985
I'm the only stubborn one
who won't change.

00:30:55.945 --> 00:30:56.785
Huai'an.

00:30:59.745 --> 00:31:01.305
I've prepared a letter.

00:31:01.385 --> 00:31:03.385
If anything happens to me,

00:31:05.225 --> 00:31:06.305
please deliver this

00:31:07.505 --> 00:31:08.345
to him.

00:31:19.505 --> 00:31:20.345
All right.

00:31:21.065 --> 00:31:22.865
Do you know where he is?

00:31:25.465 --> 00:31:26.425
I do not.

00:31:27.825 --> 00:31:31.345
But I'm sure he's also staring
at the same moon as we are.

00:31:40.345 --> 00:31:41.265
Hey.

00:31:42.585 --> 00:31:44.305
What exactly have you
experienced out there?

00:31:46.305 --> 00:31:47.585
It's as if you're a different man now.

00:31:49.465 --> 00:31:50.825
You didn't bungle anything either.

00:31:58.465 --> 00:31:59.345
Nasty One.

00:32:03.385 --> 00:32:04.225
What's the matter?

00:32:05.385 --> 00:32:06.265
What's on your mind?

00:32:07.905 --> 00:32:08.985
I met my elder brother.

00:32:09.065 --> 00:32:10.105
Who's your elder brother?

00:32:12.425 --> 00:32:13.265
You mean Xiao Wuyang?

00:32:14.545 --> 00:32:16.065
And, you actually left in one piece?

00:32:16.985 --> 00:32:18.425
He didn't intend to kill me.

00:32:20.185 --> 00:32:21.905
He couldn't even recognize me.

00:32:22.825 --> 00:32:24.425
But what's even stranger

00:32:26.305 --> 00:32:28.465
is that I didn't feel like
killing him either.

00:32:29.305 --> 00:32:30.825
Logically speaking,

00:32:31.665 --> 00:32:33.505
he took my empire from me.

00:32:33.585 --> 00:32:36.385
Thanks to him, I ended up like this
and became a pageboy.

00:32:36.985 --> 00:32:40.625
From a life of luxury
to chopping wood and cooking meals…

00:32:40.705 --> 00:32:42.385
I was once above everyone else.

00:32:42.985 --> 00:32:44.305
And now, I'm not.

00:32:46.825 --> 00:32:48.745
I should've hated him for it.

00:32:50.145 --> 00:32:51.825
But when I met him,

00:32:51.905 --> 00:32:53.065
I only realized

00:32:53.985 --> 00:32:56.025
that I hated the bully at Wazi Alley

00:32:56.705 --> 00:32:58.025
much more than him.

00:33:04.985 --> 00:33:05.865
Perhaps

00:33:06.905 --> 00:33:08.945
I don't love the empire
as much as I thought.

00:33:10.425 --> 00:33:11.625
Even so,

00:33:12.745 --> 00:33:14.025
there's nothing wrong with it.

00:33:16.065 --> 00:33:17.065
But you see,

00:33:18.065 --> 00:33:19.985
it's not as if any beauties here
could lead me astray.

00:33:25.225 --> 00:33:26.545
Why are you staring at me like that?

00:33:27.145 --> 00:33:29.425
The person beside me
is either you or Huai'an.

00:33:31.785 --> 00:33:32.945
Zhaolu isn't around either.

00:33:37.145 --> 00:33:38.785
Stop acting like that.

00:33:40.225 --> 00:33:42.065
I'm not used to you being this down.

00:33:44.305 --> 00:33:46.065
I prefer you when you're a nasty brat.

00:33:49.745 --> 00:33:50.585
Thanks for that.

00:33:53.985 --> 00:33:54.985
That's more like it.

00:34:11.385 --> 00:34:12.905
Did everything go smoothly last night?

00:34:12.985 --> 00:34:13.905
Were you hurt?

00:34:14.505 --> 00:34:15.625
I wasn't hurt.

00:34:16.465 --> 00:34:17.505
I claim no credit.

00:34:19.465 --> 00:34:20.465
Last night's success

00:34:20.545 --> 00:34:22.425
was all thanks to
Nasty One's quick thinking.

00:34:26.545 --> 00:34:29.185
He's both observant and witty.

00:34:30.225 --> 00:34:31.065
No wonder they admire him.

00:34:32.744 --> 00:34:33.705
People admire him?

00:34:33.784 --> 00:34:35.465
What a joke.

00:34:37.585 --> 00:34:39.105
But speaking of which,

00:34:39.185 --> 00:34:40.945
he can be quite amusing

00:34:42.145 --> 00:34:43.545
at times.

00:34:47.705 --> 00:34:48.545
Huai'an.

00:34:50.505 --> 00:34:51.585
Speaking of which,

00:34:52.505 --> 00:34:54.145
what do you plan to do

00:34:54.985 --> 00:34:56.025
once everything is over?

00:35:00.945 --> 00:35:03.425
What do you mean?
What are you trying to get at?

00:35:08.785 --> 00:35:10.065
Once everything is over,

00:35:11.625 --> 00:35:12.825
you should reunite with Bai Wan.

00:35:14.225 --> 00:35:15.665
You'll soften up a bit

00:35:16.505 --> 00:35:17.945
with loved ones by your side.

00:36:20.985 --> 00:36:22.225
Mr. Wang Pu, what brings you here?

00:36:25.465 --> 00:36:27.265
Mr. Wang, let me do the dirty chores.

00:36:27.345 --> 00:36:28.505
Do not soil your hands.

00:36:29.145 --> 00:36:30.465
It's fine.

00:36:34.465 --> 00:36:36.345
You did a great job at categorizing them.

00:36:38.705 --> 00:36:41.385
From east to west, from south to north,

00:36:41.465 --> 00:36:43.825
every alley and every household
you collected from,

00:36:43.905 --> 00:36:45.265
you marked.

00:36:47.225 --> 00:36:48.305
Why did you do it?

00:36:50.345 --> 00:36:52.145
Mr. Wang, please spare me. I can explain.

00:36:52.225 --> 00:36:53.185
I can explain.

00:36:56.825 --> 00:36:57.665
Explain yourself, then.

00:37:00.025 --> 00:37:01.345
Mr. Wang,

00:37:01.425 --> 00:37:02.905
I did the same job for seven years

00:37:02.985 --> 00:37:04.825
prior to joining Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:37:04.905 --> 00:37:06.385
I was already used to categorizing items.

00:37:06.465 --> 00:37:07.985
And, I'm quick to snatch up bargains.

00:37:08.065 --> 00:37:09.105
There's always a bargain

00:37:09.185 --> 00:37:10.585
in the places I know.

00:37:12.665 --> 00:37:13.505
Mr. Wang, look.

00:37:14.425 --> 00:37:16.545
This is a tattered fabric
from a fabric shop.

00:37:16.625 --> 00:37:17.785
This kind of fabric

00:37:17.865 --> 00:37:19.505
is good enough
for someone like me to wear.

00:37:20.745 --> 00:37:22.825
And, as for the damp herbs collected
from the pharmacies,

00:37:22.905 --> 00:37:24.545
I dried them after collecting them.

00:37:24.625 --> 00:37:25.665
I can now resell them.

00:37:25.745 --> 00:37:28.185
As for the wealthy families
living in the alley…

00:37:28.265 --> 00:37:29.185
Understood.

00:37:31.385 --> 00:37:32.945
You're smart.

00:37:34.425 --> 00:37:37.505
Later, I'll assign other tasks to you.

00:37:41.465 --> 00:37:43.065
-But,
-Mr. Wang,

00:37:43.985 --> 00:37:44.825
right now, I…

00:37:45.425 --> 00:37:46.905
You'll earn far more
than scavenging trash.

00:37:48.585 --> 00:37:50.785
Thank you, Mr. Wang. Thank you, Mr. Wang.

00:37:50.865 --> 00:37:51.705
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

00:38:01.545 --> 00:38:02.825
Mr. Wang,

00:38:02.905 --> 00:38:04.785
may I know why you came to
such a place personally?

00:38:06.345 --> 00:38:07.505
I'm looking for someone.

00:38:12.745 --> 00:38:13.785
I don't understand.

00:38:21.185 --> 00:38:24.025
Lately, quite a few outsiders have been
sneaking into Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:38:24.105 --> 00:38:25.545
I have to locate them.

00:38:28.425 --> 00:38:29.705
No matter how well they hide,

00:38:29.785 --> 00:38:31.545
they'll surely leave behind some tracks

00:38:31.625 --> 00:38:33.185
as long as they live here.

00:38:34.425 --> 00:38:38.465
And trash is where traces
are most easily left behind.

00:38:39.065 --> 00:38:40.625
Why else do you suppose

00:38:41.265 --> 00:38:43.745
I was able to find
the Baiwenhu soldier among our ranks?

00:38:49.145 --> 00:38:51.705
I've visited this place several times.

00:38:52.305 --> 00:38:54.225
I suppose I have to thank you

00:38:54.305 --> 00:38:56.465
for the excellent categorization.

00:39:02.665 --> 00:39:04.065
Since they intend to rescue Gu Yu,

00:39:04.985 --> 00:39:06.865
I'm sure they won't come alone.

00:39:32.825 --> 00:39:33.665
I found it.

00:39:38.345 --> 00:39:39.505
Mr. Wang, what is this?

00:39:42.745 --> 00:39:44.385
The Baiwenhu Army stayed
on the frontier year-round.

00:39:44.465 --> 00:39:46.945
And, the northern regions
are bitterly cold.

00:39:47.825 --> 00:39:49.145
Therefore,

00:39:49.225 --> 00:39:51.025
the Gu family hired a famous physician

00:39:51.105 --> 00:39:52.625
to develop a medicinal plaster

00:39:52.705 --> 00:39:55.145
that could relieve knee pain.

00:40:05.545 --> 00:40:07.705
I think I found their den.

00:40:14.425 --> 00:40:15.865
West Third Alley,

00:40:16.585 --> 00:40:17.705
Unit 8.

00:41:14.145 --> 00:41:15.785
Wang Pu found your tracks.

00:42:17.825 --> 00:42:19.145
This trash wasn't here before.

00:42:20.185 --> 00:42:22.425
You're right. Someone tampered with it.

00:42:24.105 --> 00:42:25.505
Thank you for the reminder.

00:42:25.585 --> 00:42:27.145
Otherwise, I'd still be in the dark.

00:42:28.265 --> 00:42:29.145
But speaking of which,

00:42:31.105 --> 00:42:31.985
how did you find out?

00:42:33.065 --> 00:42:34.025
It's because you told me

00:42:34.785 --> 00:42:36.305
Wang Pu killed a Baiwenhu soldier.

00:42:37.145 --> 00:42:39.305
The Baiwenhu Army
has gone through countless battles.

00:42:39.385 --> 00:42:41.185
Generally, they don't give away any clues.

00:42:42.265 --> 00:42:44.665
But Wang Pu is the top strategist
under Yan Fengshan.

00:42:44.745 --> 00:42:46.585
Therefore, he's more meticulous
than others.

00:42:48.785 --> 00:42:49.945
Since we can

00:42:50.025 --> 00:42:52.905
use trash to investigate
Hidden Soldier Alley,

00:42:52.985 --> 00:42:55.265
of course they can
use the same way to locate

00:42:55.345 --> 00:42:56.225
the Baiwenhu Army.

00:42:56.865 --> 00:42:58.385
How many of them remain hidden here?

00:42:59.305 --> 00:43:01.505
I've already transferred
the rest of them away.

00:43:01.585 --> 00:43:03.825
According to the information you gave me,

00:43:03.905 --> 00:43:06.905
several residences to the west
are already vacant.

00:43:09.305 --> 00:43:12.065
This is the complete map
of the Hidden Soldier Alley base.

00:43:12.145 --> 00:43:14.025
We've marked everything we found out

00:43:14.105 --> 00:43:15.625
on this map.

00:43:16.225 --> 00:43:18.785
The key to the operation
lies at Zuihua Tower.

00:43:18.865 --> 00:43:19.785
ZUIHUA TOWER

00:43:19.865 --> 00:43:21.065
The shops on both sides

00:43:21.145 --> 00:43:22.785
of the street,
and the Huben soldiers as well,

00:43:22.865 --> 00:43:25.865
were all posted here
to keep watch and lie in ambush.

00:43:26.865 --> 00:43:27.705
Where are the goods?

00:43:28.385 --> 00:43:30.185
They are ready.
We're merely biding our time.

00:43:32.425 --> 00:43:33.505
The sun will set soon.

00:43:33.585 --> 00:43:35.425
It's time to act.

00:43:50.145 --> 00:43:51.545
Act according to the plan.

00:43:51.625 --> 00:43:52.505
At the very end,

00:43:52.585 --> 00:43:54.745
we will evacuate the general
from the designated location.

00:43:55.865 --> 00:43:57.305
The Huben Army will chase us hard.

00:43:58.465 --> 00:43:59.705
You must be careful.

00:43:59.785 --> 00:44:01.025
Don't worry.

00:44:01.105 --> 00:44:03.465
My friend and I will make it in time.

00:44:04.545 --> 00:44:06.865
This time, the Baiwenhu Army owes you one.

00:44:35.745 --> 00:44:36.785
Has it begun?

00:44:37.465 --> 00:44:38.545
It has.

00:46:24.945 --> 00:46:25.905
Wang Pu,

00:46:26.905 --> 00:46:29.305
the top strategist under Yan Fengshan.

00:46:29.385 --> 00:46:30.545
How long do you think

00:46:30.625 --> 00:46:32.705
it'll take for him to notice
that you've rescued Gu Yu?
