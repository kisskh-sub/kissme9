00:00:01.742 --> 00:00:03.812
(Episode 38)

00:00:23.432 --> 00:00:24.432
Dad.

00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:29.002
I was wrong.

00:00:32.212 --> 00:00:33.812
I was so completely wrong.

00:00:34.882 --> 00:00:35.882
What?

00:00:36.482 --> 00:00:37.982
What is this all of a sudden?

00:00:38.612 --> 00:00:40.452
Why are you suddenly on your knees?

00:00:41.722 --> 00:00:44.422
Why didn't you tell me? Why?

00:00:46.422 --> 00:00:47.992
Dad, how could you just take that?

00:00:49.422 --> 00:00:51.432
You were humiliated like that because of me,

00:00:51.862 --> 00:00:54.262
so why didn't you tell me sooner?

00:00:55.362 --> 00:00:56.362
Hold on.

00:00:56.902 --> 00:00:58.772
What have you heard?

00:00:59.772 --> 00:01:01.802
Can you at least explain what this is about?

00:01:03.472 --> 00:01:04.712
I met Jung Bo A.

00:01:07.612 --> 00:01:08.882
She came back to Korea.

00:01:10.582 --> 00:01:11.682
And she found out.

00:01:14.012 --> 00:01:16.352
Are you talking about the money for the clothes?

00:01:26.392 --> 00:01:30.062
My mother must not have known who you were when she let you in.

00:01:30.932 --> 00:01:32.472
Say what you have to say and get out.

00:01:34.272 --> 00:01:37.342
The CEO sent me to deliver this.

00:01:39.072 --> 00:01:40.172
What's this?

00:01:40.872 --> 00:01:42.282
It doesn't look like a letter.

00:01:43.542 --> 00:01:46.052
I get the feeling you have a message to deliver as well.

00:01:47.852 --> 00:01:49.652
I will relay his exact words.

00:01:50.952 --> 00:01:54.192
If we're assigning blame for the wedding being called off,

00:01:55.162 --> 00:01:58.262
the CEO and his wife are not at fault.

00:01:58.892 --> 00:02:00.562
So they could have just cut all ties,

00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:06.132
but out of moral obligation, all the expenses for the wedding...

00:02:06.502 --> 00:02:09.042
were paid by CEO Jung Ho Yeong of Haneul Construction.

00:02:10.372 --> 00:02:12.612
He knows the groom's family isn't well-off,

00:02:13.772 --> 00:02:17.742
and it seems your only expense was for the family's outfits.

00:02:18.812 --> 00:02:20.912
He said this is to reimburse you for your out-of-pocket costs.

00:02:22.522 --> 00:02:25.252
Reimburse our out-of-pocket costs?

00:02:27.192 --> 00:02:29.362
He also said that if you, Lee Ji Hyuk's father,

00:02:30.522 --> 00:02:34.162
feel this amount is insufficient,

00:02:35.332 --> 00:02:37.532
I am to remind you that Jung Bo A called off the wedding,

00:02:38.302 --> 00:02:40.472
and therefore, her father, CEO Jung Ho Yeong,

00:02:41.132 --> 00:02:44.472
is not liable for any damages.

00:02:44.842 --> 00:02:49.612
So he's taking it out on my son for losing his pathetic daughter.

00:02:54.552 --> 00:02:56.582
Fine. Let's see it.

00:03:02.062 --> 00:03:03.522
Twenty thousand dollars?

00:03:04.592 --> 00:03:05.992
Is my son, Ji Hyuk,

00:03:06.762 --> 00:03:07.862
only worth this much to you?

00:03:09.762 --> 00:03:11.032
Twenty thousand dollars?

00:03:12.632 --> 00:03:14.942
I'm sorry, sir.

00:03:19.442 --> 00:03:20.512
Here. Take it back.

00:03:21.942 --> 00:03:25.112
If I don't give you this, the CEO will have my head.

00:03:25.352 --> 00:03:26.952
If you leave this here,

00:03:27.682 --> 00:03:29.722
that jerk, Jung Ho Yeong, will die by my hands.

00:03:30.182 --> 00:03:31.182
Got it?

00:03:31.752 --> 00:03:34.252
Your side can take responsibility for the damages your daughter did,

00:03:34.592 --> 00:03:36.922
and I'll take responsibility for the ones my son caused.

00:03:38.332 --> 00:03:42.762
And if I so much as hear the name "Haneul Construction" again,

00:03:43.162 --> 00:03:45.902
tell him I'll come over there and kill Jung Ho Yeong myself.

00:03:47.272 --> 00:03:49.172
The nerve of him. Like father, like daughter.

00:03:49.502 --> 00:03:51.842
How dare he take it out on us when he can't control his own child?

00:03:58.312 --> 00:04:00.552
Sang Cheol...

00:04:02.552 --> 00:04:04.992
My poor son.

00:04:05.622 --> 00:04:07.422
My son, what are we going to do?

00:04:08.022 --> 00:04:09.122
My goodness.

00:04:09.392 --> 00:04:14.332
How can they be so vile and shameless? My goodness.

00:04:15.902 --> 00:04:19.502
It's for the best. We're lucky we didn't become in-laws...

00:04:19.602 --> 00:04:22.872
with a jerk like that. Gosh, my son. It's okay.

00:04:23.842 --> 00:04:25.642
My goodness, my poor son.

00:04:30.542 --> 00:04:32.082
Why didn't you tell me?

00:04:34.722 --> 00:04:36.622
That you were humiliated like that because of me.

00:04:38.722 --> 00:04:40.252
You should have told me right away.

00:04:42.962 --> 00:04:46.392
The bride ran away and ruined the wedding.

00:04:47.292 --> 00:04:49.062
"Here's money for your clothes. Now, get lost."

00:04:50.562 --> 00:04:54.002
That's the humiliation I suffered. And you ask why I didn't tell you?

00:04:55.572 --> 00:04:57.002
How could I possibly tell you?

00:04:57.742 --> 00:04:59.012
What was I supposed to say?

00:05:00.042 --> 00:05:01.042
That you...

00:05:01.542 --> 00:05:03.342
tried to marry a woman...

00:05:04.912 --> 00:05:07.012
who was in love with someone else for her money,

00:05:07.782 --> 00:05:10.122
and that I was humiliated by it? Should I have said that?

00:05:12.292 --> 00:05:13.492
How could I bring that up...

00:05:15.262 --> 00:05:17.292
when I knew it would only hurt you more?

00:05:18.332 --> 00:05:20.732
What kind of parent attacks their own child's weak spot?

00:05:22.532 --> 00:05:23.532
Dad.

00:05:26.202 --> 00:05:28.042
So you were just suffering in silence?

00:05:28.872 --> 00:05:30.042
Ji Hyuk.

00:05:31.272 --> 00:05:33.512
Why did you turn out like this?

00:05:33.512 --> 00:05:35.782
I don't think this is how I raised you.

00:05:36.682 --> 00:05:38.612
If you believe your life is right,

00:05:39.582 --> 00:05:40.852
then just keep believing it.

00:05:43.952 --> 00:05:46.122
But don't force your children to agree with you.

00:05:46.892 --> 00:05:47.892
I...

00:05:48.792 --> 00:05:50.992
haven't done anything wrong to you.

00:05:52.162 --> 00:05:56.662
Stop taking your victim complex out on me. All right?

00:05:56.862 --> 00:05:59.802
You think you've done nothing wrong?

00:06:00.802 --> 00:06:02.542
Oh, you have. You definitely have.

00:06:03.002 --> 00:06:05.112
You've done something wrong.

00:06:06.712 --> 00:06:07.712
Like what?

00:06:08.642 --> 00:06:10.212
What is it, Dad?

00:06:10.942 --> 00:06:14.852
I can't tell you, you punk. If you found out...

00:06:16.082 --> 00:06:19.222
No. It's not the time. Not yet.

00:06:20.322 --> 00:06:21.322
I'm sorry.

00:06:25.632 --> 00:06:26.662
I'm sorry.

00:06:27.992 --> 00:06:29.462
I'm sorry, Dad.

00:06:31.502 --> 00:06:32.832
You rotten kid.

00:06:33.702 --> 00:06:38.242
Couldn't you just say "I was wrong" before you knew the whole story?

00:06:38.972 --> 00:06:43.142
Was that so much to ask? Why are all you kids so proud?

00:06:43.982 --> 00:06:45.782
Your father was telling you how hard it's been.

00:06:46.082 --> 00:06:49.422
You just had to say, "I was wrong." Why was that so hard for you?

00:06:50.422 --> 00:06:51.752
For everything that went wrong today...

00:06:52.192 --> 00:06:53.792
and for the great trouble I've caused you both,

00:06:54.492 --> 00:06:57.062
I am truly sorry. I am so sorry.

00:06:57.062 --> 00:06:58.532
I apologised.

00:06:58.862 --> 00:07:00.332
Not "I was wrong."

00:07:00.332 --> 00:07:03.232
That I humiliated you and Mom and never begged for forgiveness.

00:07:03.902 --> 00:07:06.572
- Is that what makes you so angry? - You think that's all I am? Angry?

00:07:07.132 --> 00:07:10.502
You trampled all over my 33-year career, you punk!

00:07:10.572 --> 00:07:12.372
You turned your back on everything I am.

00:07:12.372 --> 00:07:14.742
You made me feel like my whole life was for nothing, you punk.

00:07:14.842 --> 00:07:18.152
The life I lived as a provider, a father, and a son...

00:07:18.212 --> 00:07:20.252
You completely trampled all over it, you little punk!

00:07:21.212 --> 00:07:22.452
Back then...

00:07:25.452 --> 00:07:27.892
I honestly didn't think I was doing anything wrong.

00:07:30.192 --> 00:07:32.532
I thought you had no idea the pain I was in.

00:07:34.432 --> 00:07:36.302
I thought you were criticizing me...

00:07:37.902 --> 00:07:40.802
for blaming my circumstances.

00:07:44.342 --> 00:07:46.872
Even though she still loved another man,

00:07:49.842 --> 00:07:51.082
I ignored that...

00:07:52.982 --> 00:07:55.952
and tried to marry her just for her status...

00:07:58.992 --> 00:08:00.692
The idea that you simply couldn't accept it...

00:08:03.422 --> 00:08:05.792
That never even crossed my mind.

00:08:07.232 --> 00:08:09.232
Since it never crossed your mind,

00:08:09.832 --> 00:08:12.072
I guess that's why you pushed forward with the wedding.

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:18.872
I was truly...

00:08:19.912 --> 00:08:22.342
I was truly wrong, Dad.

00:08:24.642 --> 00:08:25.652
I really was...

00:08:28.852 --> 00:08:30.882
I was so wrong.

00:08:32.492 --> 00:08:35.162
Those simple words, "I was wrong."

00:08:36.592 --> 00:08:38.392
Was it that hard to swallow your pride and say them?

00:08:39.392 --> 00:08:40.392
Was it?

00:08:44.562 --> 00:08:47.032
You rotten kid. You awful, rotten kid.

00:08:47.502 --> 00:08:48.942
You think you're so great, don't you? You brat.

00:08:49.202 --> 00:08:50.542
So high and mighty, you punk.

00:08:58.382 --> 00:09:00.052
Dad.

00:09:14.662 --> 00:09:16.262
Please forgive me...

00:09:17.502 --> 00:09:18.832
for my terrible choice.

00:09:22.102 --> 00:09:23.102
Mom.

00:09:23.702 --> 00:09:26.972
Did Dad and Ji Hyuk really have all that history between them?

00:09:27.442 --> 00:09:29.812
I had no idea things were that bad between them.

00:09:32.352 --> 00:09:34.312
It's over now. It's finally over.

00:09:35.452 --> 00:09:38.622
I guess Grandma wanted them to reconcile as she was leaving us.

00:09:41.022 --> 00:09:42.692
On the day when they came by to give us the money,

00:09:44.022 --> 00:09:45.392
Grandma and Dad...

00:09:45.962 --> 00:09:47.432
must have been so devastated.

00:09:49.002 --> 00:09:51.332
The reason your father couldn't let it go for so long...

00:09:51.902 --> 00:09:52.972
It all makes sense now.

00:09:54.632 --> 00:09:55.642
Come on.

00:10:06.852 --> 00:10:08.652
Honey, Ji Hyuk.

00:10:09.252 --> 00:10:11.052
We're about to have some ramyeon.

00:10:11.382 --> 00:10:14.722
Should I just cook 2 packs for Su Bin and me, or make 4?

00:10:17.362 --> 00:10:19.532
Aren't you hungry?

00:10:20.892 --> 00:10:21.902
I am hungry.

00:10:23.662 --> 00:10:26.232
Aren't you hungry, Dad?

00:10:27.602 --> 00:10:29.902
I knew it. I heard your stomach rumbling.

00:10:43.382 --> 00:10:46.452
My, I smell ramyeon! Are you guys eating already?

00:10:46.852 --> 00:10:49.692
- I'm hungry too. - Okay, I'll make you some.

00:10:49.692 --> 00:10:52.392
Mom, come on. You're not even fully recovered yet.

00:10:53.332 --> 00:10:55.532
Hey, Su Bin. You don't want a puffy face.

00:10:55.602 --> 00:10:56.602
You're not drinking the broth, are you?

00:10:56.662 --> 00:10:58.432
I'm feeling empty inside. I need the broth.

00:10:59.302 --> 00:11:00.472
Then just wait a minute.

00:11:08.882 --> 00:11:10.982
Wow, this is amazing. Bean sprout ramyeon.

00:11:16.422 --> 00:11:18.522
It's only been a few days since your grandmother passed,

00:11:18.892 --> 00:11:20.752
and here we are enjoying ramyeon...

00:11:22.092 --> 00:11:23.592
with bean sprouts and everything.

00:11:25.132 --> 00:11:28.802
Mom, stop talking like you should feel guilty.

00:11:29.762 --> 00:11:31.332
Go to any wake.

00:11:31.732 --> 00:11:33.772
You think the chief mourners starve for three whole days?

00:11:34.272 --> 00:11:37.972
They cry, then they get hungry, so they eat.

00:11:38.942 --> 00:11:40.272
That's just being human.

00:11:41.012 --> 00:11:45.482
That's right. At the funeral, I had the soup and rice they served.

00:11:48.212 --> 00:11:50.582
But, Ji Hyuk, why are you so quiet? Just eating your ramyeon.

00:11:51.922 --> 00:11:53.022
Your eyes are all puffy.

00:11:53.652 --> 00:11:54.922
Were you crying?

00:11:55.662 --> 00:11:57.322
Are you still that sad?

00:11:57.992 --> 00:12:00.592
Ji Wan, hurry up with the ramyeon. I need my broth.

00:12:09.002 --> 00:12:10.242
So how does it feel?

00:12:11.002 --> 00:12:13.342
You finally got Ji Hyuk to admit he was wrong.

00:12:13.912 --> 00:12:16.242
He formally apologised. How do you feel now?

00:12:17.312 --> 00:12:20.712
What do you mean, "finally?" It was the least he could do.

00:12:21.152 --> 00:12:22.322
Exactly.

00:12:22.722 --> 00:12:24.582
Whether it was "finally" or "the least he could do,"

00:12:25.022 --> 00:12:27.022
Ji Hyuk got on his knees and apologised.

00:12:28.562 --> 00:12:30.792
It felt like a huge weight was lifted off my chest.

00:12:32.832 --> 00:12:33.832
I bet.

00:12:34.262 --> 00:12:36.532
Nothing hurts more than being wounded by your own child.

00:12:37.402 --> 00:12:40.732
And the thing is, they're completely oblivious to it.

00:12:41.942 --> 00:12:45.512
How can they know how parents feel? They're too busy trying to get by.

00:12:47.172 --> 00:12:48.172
By the way, honey,

00:12:48.582 --> 00:12:51.312
they call our generation the "Last-First Generation."

00:12:52.212 --> 00:12:53.212
What?

00:12:54.152 --> 00:12:56.652
We're the last generation to take care of our parents...

00:12:57.052 --> 00:13:01.192
and the first kids won't support. Hence, the "Last-First Generation."

00:13:02.222 --> 00:13:04.092
That's not wrong,

00:13:05.092 --> 00:13:06.732
but thinking about it makes me kind of sad.

00:13:12.172 --> 00:13:14.932
I feel so relieved now that I've admitted I was wrong.

00:13:19.172 --> 00:13:20.842
I should go have a beer with Dad.

00:13:25.412 --> 00:13:26.412
What?

00:13:28.822 --> 00:13:29.882
Is that Seong Jae's car?

00:13:31.222 --> 00:13:32.522
He might as well just be my parents' son.

00:13:33.552 --> 00:13:34.552
Wait.

00:13:34.852 --> 00:13:36.222
Wait, that's not the way to our house.

00:13:40.262 --> 00:13:42.762
Park Seong Jae! What do you think you're doing?

00:13:45.372 --> 00:13:46.532
What is he talking about?

00:13:59.682 --> 00:14:01.782
Seong Jae, why did you speed like that?

00:14:02.422 --> 00:14:04.482
Ji Hyuk sent me a strange text.

00:14:05.082 --> 00:14:06.952
I guess I panicked for nothing.

00:14:08.092 --> 00:14:09.222
Ji Hyuk did?

00:14:10.362 --> 00:14:11.462
What did it say?

00:14:11.892 --> 00:14:14.192
Was Ji Hyuk home when you left?

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:15.562
Yes.

00:14:16.532 --> 00:14:21.072
Hey, do you know what happened with Dad and Ji Hyuk today?

00:14:21.172 --> 00:14:24.902
Man, what on earth could this mean?

00:14:26.342 --> 00:14:27.342
Seong Jae?

00:14:29.982 --> 00:14:30.982
Yes.

00:14:31.342 --> 00:14:33.112
Look at me when you talk to me.

00:14:33.852 --> 00:14:35.352
Sorry.

00:14:42.492 --> 00:14:44.362
- Ji Hyuk? - Hey, Ji Hyuk.

00:14:50.902 --> 00:14:51.902
Both of you, get out.

00:15:05.912 --> 00:15:06.912
Park Seong Jae.

00:15:07.682 --> 00:15:08.882
What do you think you're doing?

00:15:09.582 --> 00:15:12.722
- Ji Hyuk, I liked him first. - Ji Hyuk...

00:15:12.792 --> 00:15:13.792
Lee Su Bin.

00:15:14.492 --> 00:15:16.622
- Go home. - I liked him first,

00:15:16.622 --> 00:15:18.092
and I confessed my feelings first.

00:15:18.162 --> 00:15:20.732
Seong Jae kept saying no and that it was a bad idea,

00:15:20.992 --> 00:15:23.932
but I insisted we date. Seong Jae didn't do anything wrong.

00:15:23.932 --> 00:15:25.232
I said get in the house!

00:15:26.702 --> 00:15:28.172
Don't yell at Su Bin.

00:15:28.772 --> 00:15:29.772
Take it out on me.

00:15:30.302 --> 00:15:32.272
Don't act like you're to blame. You didn't do anything wrong.

00:15:34.012 --> 00:15:35.342
I can't believe these two.

00:15:35.482 --> 00:15:37.182
I'll take Su Bin home. We can talk after.

00:15:37.512 --> 00:15:38.582
It's a one-minute run from here.

00:15:40.312 --> 00:15:41.312
Su Bin.

00:15:42.452 --> 00:15:44.052
- Go. - Ji Hyuk.

00:15:44.122 --> 00:15:45.122
Are you going or not?

00:15:47.892 --> 00:15:48.892
Fine.

00:15:51.762 --> 00:15:53.762
Seong Jae, I'll go by myself.

00:15:54.292 --> 00:15:55.832
Call me if anything happens.

00:16:07.442 --> 00:16:08.442
Seong Jae.

00:16:09.442 --> 00:16:10.482
You...

00:16:11.212 --> 00:16:13.912
What do you think you're doing with my sister?

00:16:15.082 --> 00:16:17.422
How could you? With Su Bin...

00:16:18.152 --> 00:16:19.392
Seriously, how long has this been going on?

00:16:20.222 --> 00:16:22.622
You were into Eun Oh until recently, right?

00:16:23.622 --> 00:16:28.232
You were into Eun Oh for years, so why are you with my sister?

00:16:28.592 --> 00:16:30.232
It wasn't that I was in love with Eun Oh.

00:16:30.962 --> 00:16:33.002
I told you. I admired her.

00:16:34.102 --> 00:16:35.332
It was admiration.

00:16:36.772 --> 00:16:38.472
I thought, "I want to love someone like her."

00:16:38.912 --> 00:16:42.682
"I wish a girl like her were mine." Or maybe...

00:16:43.782 --> 00:16:46.482
Maybe I was just in love with the feeling...

00:16:47.512 --> 00:16:48.782
of being in love.

00:16:50.552 --> 00:16:52.092
And you just told me that.

00:16:52.122 --> 00:16:56.322
You're the one who made me realise that I wasn't in love with Eun Oh.

00:16:57.692 --> 00:17:00.162
Seong Jae, you... You're not in love with Eun Oh.

00:17:00.432 --> 00:17:01.562
I can't hold back.

00:17:01.832 --> 00:17:05.262
I just can't bring myself to. I want to tell Eun Oh right now.

00:17:05.672 --> 00:17:06.832
Hearing you...

00:17:06.832 --> 00:17:09.202
and seeing the look in your eyes, I wondered, "Is that what love is?"

00:17:10.402 --> 00:17:12.342
And Su Bin made me understand what that is.

00:17:14.012 --> 00:17:17.012
Su Bin means that much to you?

00:17:17.342 --> 00:17:19.412
Did it take you a long time to fall for Ji Eun Oh?

00:17:20.582 --> 00:17:22.482
Developing romantic feelings for her after ten years of friendship...

00:17:23.382 --> 00:17:25.952
Has it been a year since you fell so hard you couldn't hold back?

00:17:29.892 --> 00:17:33.292
Hearing you, I finally understood what that feeling was.

00:17:33.862 --> 00:17:35.332
And I'm telling you, it was because of Su Bin.

00:17:36.162 --> 00:17:37.832
That's how this happened with Su Bin.

00:17:40.002 --> 00:17:41.172
So please, Ji Hyuk.

00:17:43.602 --> 00:17:46.642
Can't you just cut me some slack this once?

00:17:46.712 --> 00:17:48.072
Cut you some slack? Are you kidding me?

00:17:49.482 --> 00:17:51.942
You're divorced, you jerk.

00:17:53.482 --> 00:17:54.582
And that's not all, is it?

00:17:55.622 --> 00:17:56.782
What about my parents?

00:17:56.852 --> 00:18:01.352
No, forget them. What about your own family?

00:18:04.192 --> 00:18:05.292
How could you do this to me...

00:18:06.332 --> 00:18:08.662
How could you do this to my parents?

00:18:08.662 --> 00:18:10.402
That's why I tried to stop myself.

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:12.602
I told you. I tried not to start anything.

00:18:13.332 --> 00:18:14.732
But I just couldn't help myself.

00:18:15.642 --> 00:18:16.772
You're the one who said it.

00:18:17.102 --> 00:18:19.212
That you couldn't hold back. That you just couldn't do it!

00:18:20.242 --> 00:18:21.242
You can.

00:18:21.872 --> 00:18:23.812
I'm holding back with Eun Oh, aren't I?

00:18:24.242 --> 00:18:25.482
That's just you bottling it up.

00:18:26.152 --> 00:18:28.312
- That's not holding back. - Then you bottle it up too.

00:18:32.352 --> 00:18:35.092
- So we can't even date? - No, you can't even "just date."

00:18:36.122 --> 00:18:37.292
Because you'll get attached.

00:18:38.422 --> 00:18:39.462
Ji Hyuk.

00:18:40.692 --> 00:18:44.432
We agreed to just try dating for 100 days.

00:18:45.302 --> 00:18:46.302
Hey.

00:18:47.172 --> 00:18:48.602
Su Bin's a lot younger than me, you know.

00:18:50.042 --> 00:18:51.772
A young, pretty girl like Su Bin...

00:18:52.572 --> 00:18:54.212
Why would she like a guy like me for a long time?

00:18:54.212 --> 00:18:55.782
It's just a passing crush.

00:18:56.682 --> 00:18:59.312
She might get tired of me and end it before we even hit 100 days.

00:19:00.152 --> 00:19:02.982
So please, just for 100 days.

00:19:05.082 --> 00:19:06.522
Just let it slide this once. Please?

00:19:06.752 --> 00:19:08.122
Don't give me that "100 days" nonsense.

00:19:08.962 --> 00:19:10.892
What if you're still together after 100 days?

00:19:11.592 --> 00:19:13.362
What if your feelings for each other grow even stronger?

00:19:14.562 --> 00:19:16.532
What, are you going to ask for a one-year extension?

00:19:17.132 --> 00:19:18.902
Or two years? Three?

00:19:21.172 --> 00:19:23.442
I know exactly what your family is like.

00:19:24.502 --> 00:19:25.872
I saw it all happen.

00:19:26.772 --> 00:19:28.672
The second you secretly married Yeo Jin,

00:19:29.142 --> 00:19:32.082
your father cut you off completely...

00:19:33.812 --> 00:19:36.722
and bribed your landlord to get you kicked out of your home.

00:19:36.782 --> 00:19:38.052
Things are different now.

00:19:38.722 --> 00:19:39.852
I'm in a different position now.

00:19:41.992 --> 00:19:44.992
I won't let Su Bin go through anything like that.

00:19:45.832 --> 00:19:48.632
- I'll get your parents' permission. - My parents?

00:19:49.762 --> 00:19:51.302
If you let my parents find out about this,

00:19:52.872 --> 00:19:53.972
you're a dead man.

00:19:57.742 --> 00:19:59.672
If you want to date Su Bin for even 100 days,

00:20:00.312 --> 00:20:01.742
you get your father's permission first.

00:20:02.412 --> 00:20:04.342
Even if you were just "talking,"

00:20:04.342 --> 00:20:06.582
you should've handled your father first.

00:20:08.252 --> 00:20:11.322
Especially since it's my little sister.

00:20:14.992 --> 00:20:15.992
You're right.

00:20:18.192 --> 00:20:19.662
I'm truly sorry about that, Ji Hyuk.

00:20:22.562 --> 00:20:23.762
Until you get his permission,

00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:26.272
don't contact Su Bin.

00:20:29.842 --> 00:20:30.842
Ji Hyuk...

00:20:44.552 --> 00:20:45.552
How did it go?

00:20:46.192 --> 00:20:47.422
He didn't hit you, did he?

00:20:50.162 --> 00:20:51.192
Lee Su Bin.

00:20:58.762 --> 00:21:00.032
So you didn't hit him.

00:21:01.672 --> 00:21:03.302
You were worried I might've hit Seong Jae?

00:21:03.672 --> 00:21:05.172
Gosh, kid.

00:21:06.712 --> 00:21:09.112
I'm done talking with Seong Jae.

00:21:10.412 --> 00:21:12.952
Did Seong Jae say he'd break up with me?

00:21:13.812 --> 00:21:15.822
Do you think I'd be friends with a guy who'd do that?

00:21:16.252 --> 00:21:19.292
I knew it! There's no way he'd do that.

00:21:19.952 --> 00:21:21.592
You know him better than anyone.

00:21:22.592 --> 00:21:25.932
You know what a great person Seong Jae is.

00:21:26.692 --> 00:21:29.162
How on earth did you end up liking Seong Jae?

00:21:29.432 --> 00:21:31.632
Did it happen while filming YouTube?

00:21:31.632 --> 00:21:34.032
Or because he's a rich heir?

00:21:34.172 --> 00:21:36.802
Of course not. I'm not like you!

00:21:37.772 --> 00:21:38.772
What?

00:21:38.842 --> 00:21:40.312
No matter how rich he is,

00:21:40.312 --> 00:21:42.212
do you really think I would go for a divorced guy?

00:21:42.882 --> 00:21:44.212
Especially with Mom and Dad to consider.

00:21:45.642 --> 00:21:49.252
But it got to the point where his divorce didn't matter.

00:21:49.952 --> 00:21:51.682
That's how much I fell for Seong Jae.

00:21:52.722 --> 00:21:53.752
Su Bin.

00:21:55.992 --> 00:21:57.122
It's not just about the divorce.

00:21:58.222 --> 00:21:59.862
What do you mean, it's not just about the divorce?

00:22:00.492 --> 00:22:01.962
There's a whole world you don't know about.

00:22:02.732 --> 00:22:05.432
So, until Seong Jae sorts this out and I give you my permission,

00:22:05.902 --> 00:22:07.502
don't contact Seong Jae for the time being.

00:22:08.072 --> 00:22:09.242
This is a warning from your older brother.

00:22:10.902 --> 00:22:14.672
Let's not break Mom and Dad's hearts after they just lost Grandma.

00:22:15.742 --> 00:22:20.682
- But we just want to date. - Enough. Don't see him for a while.

00:22:21.312 --> 00:22:22.312
Got it?

00:22:26.892 --> 00:22:28.492
Seong Jae won't be contacting you for a while either.

00:22:29.462 --> 00:22:31.862
Don't take this as a joke.

00:22:38.902 --> 00:22:41.632
A joke? I'm terrified right now.

00:22:42.542 --> 00:22:44.402
What is going on that's making him act like this?

00:22:50.642 --> 00:22:52.512
If you want to date Su Bin for even 100 days,

00:22:53.782 --> 00:22:55.382
you get your father's permission first.

00:23:02.022 --> 00:23:03.192
Ji Hyuk...

00:23:04.562 --> 00:23:06.792
knows my own father's a lost cause.

00:23:07.662 --> 00:23:11.062
Melt plenty of butter in a pan and add milk so it doesn't burn.

00:23:11.532 --> 00:23:13.672
Flip the slices of bread back and forth,

00:23:14.032 --> 00:23:15.632
and let it soak up the melted butter.

00:23:16.202 --> 00:23:18.502
Wait, is that butter I smell? What are you doing?

00:23:19.002 --> 00:23:20.312
I'm making French toast.

00:23:20.842 --> 00:23:22.312
Why are you making this?

00:23:22.812 --> 00:23:24.942
If you wanted some, you should've just asked me.

00:23:25.512 --> 00:23:29.452
From now on, no more big breakfasts with rice, soup, and side dishes.

00:23:29.522 --> 00:23:32.352
Let's just eat something simple. It doesn't have to be Korean food.

00:23:32.892 --> 00:23:35.792
Right, but even so, why are you the one making it?

00:23:36.522 --> 00:23:37.622
Where did you get the ingredients?

00:23:37.762 --> 00:23:40.932
I woke up early and went to a convenience store to get them.

00:23:41.792 --> 00:23:44.362
And from now on, on the days I don't have my part-time job,

00:23:44.632 --> 00:23:46.102
I'll make breakfast. Okay?

00:23:47.772 --> 00:23:50.602
- What's that smell? - Ji Hyuk.

00:23:50.902 --> 00:23:52.512
Your father's making breakfast.

00:23:53.412 --> 00:23:56.442
Is he? What's so weird about that?

00:23:56.712 --> 00:23:58.942
There are no gender roles for chores anymore.

00:23:59.452 --> 00:24:00.652
Gosh, son.

00:24:00.912 --> 00:24:04.822
Can't you just say something like, "Dad, you're amazing?"

00:24:05.482 --> 00:24:07.452
Dad, you're amazing.

00:24:08.022 --> 00:24:09.862
You bet I am. You brat.

00:24:10.422 --> 00:24:11.892
- This looks good. - Yes.

00:24:13.762 --> 00:24:18.932
I was planning to go with you if it was just for your checkup,

00:24:19.002 --> 00:24:21.602
but your friends are visiting Woo Jin too.

00:24:22.602 --> 00:24:25.272
Even if they weren't, I could totally go alone.

00:24:25.642 --> 00:24:27.572
I'm well enough to go to work, you know.

00:24:28.842 --> 00:24:32.312
So today's the day you tell them about you and Woo Jin, right?

00:24:32.912 --> 00:24:37.252
Yeong In, Gyeong Hui, and Min Seong are going to flip out.

00:24:37.722 --> 00:24:39.222
Of course, I have to tell them.

00:24:39.952 --> 00:24:41.952
They're Woo Jin's only friends.

00:24:43.262 --> 00:24:46.632
Just thinking about it makes my heart race.

00:24:47.492 --> 00:24:48.962
I'll tell you all about it tonight, Mom.

00:24:49.502 --> 00:24:51.632
- I'm heading out. - Okay. Don't push yourself.

00:24:51.632 --> 00:24:52.702
I won't.

00:25:09.622 --> 00:25:11.222
Woo Jin's friends are here.

00:25:11.952 --> 00:25:15.962
Hello. Woo Jin, I'll come back later.

00:25:23.302 --> 00:25:24.602
Woo Jin, it's okay.

00:25:25.102 --> 00:25:26.302
Don't worry, Han Woo Jin.

00:25:31.342 --> 00:25:32.872
What's with those looks?

00:25:33.542 --> 00:25:35.542
Woo Jin must've told them everything.

00:25:35.842 --> 00:25:37.442
That clueless fool.

00:25:38.342 --> 00:25:41.382
Woo Jin and Eun Oh. Those two are trouble.

00:25:44.422 --> 00:25:45.922
We're heading out. Take care of yourself.

00:25:46.022 --> 00:25:48.952
- Good luck. Rest up. We're off. - I'll be in touch.

00:25:49.092 --> 00:25:50.722
- Thanks for coming. - Bye!

00:25:53.632 --> 00:25:57.102
Woo Jin. Let's go to the exam room. You can walk, right?

00:26:05.672 --> 00:26:06.742
I'm going to get my tests done.

00:26:07.872 --> 00:26:11.412
There's a caregiver waiting outside. Go with her for your tests.

00:26:12.712 --> 00:26:14.312
You and I need to talk.

00:26:15.712 --> 00:26:18.452
- Mom. - Woo Jin. Do your tests first.

00:26:18.452 --> 00:26:20.422
We'll talk later.

00:26:33.002 --> 00:26:36.242
You're not going to like this, but this is how I do things.

00:26:37.072 --> 00:26:39.342
How else am I supposed to thank you, if not with money?

00:26:40.242 --> 00:26:43.712
That's how life works. You get something, you pay for it.

00:26:47.682 --> 00:26:48.682
I understand.

00:26:52.152 --> 00:26:53.292
(Cashier's Check: One Million Dollars)

00:26:54.652 --> 00:26:55.692
It's one million dollars.

00:26:59.592 --> 00:27:00.792
Leave Woo Jin alone.

00:27:04.062 --> 00:27:06.002
You've grown up to have a backbone.

00:27:06.832 --> 00:27:08.472
But Woo Jin is fragile.

00:27:09.172 --> 00:27:12.572
This kind of chaos isn't good for him right now.

00:27:12.742 --> 00:27:14.872
That his sister was his friend?

00:27:15.342 --> 00:27:17.112
Or that his friend turned out to be his sister?

00:27:18.282 --> 00:27:19.382
Both.

00:27:20.352 --> 00:27:23.822
And that more and more people are finding out about your story.

00:27:28.322 --> 00:27:29.622
For Woo Jin's sake,

00:27:31.022 --> 00:27:32.262
cut off all contact with him.

00:27:33.632 --> 00:27:34.862
Is that a request?

00:27:36.462 --> 00:27:37.532
You're not saying...

00:27:37.532 --> 00:27:39.832
that was in the deal for just a million, are you?

00:27:51.042 --> 00:27:52.242
Says the one who took the money.

00:27:56.122 --> 00:27:58.452
(Reception, Patient Services)

00:28:07.592 --> 00:28:09.762
Go take a 15-minute coffee break.

00:28:17.872 --> 00:28:19.912
I've settled things with Eun Oh.

00:28:22.342 --> 00:28:25.582
- "Settled things?" - I thanked her for the transplant.

00:28:27.212 --> 00:28:28.352
How?

00:28:29.352 --> 00:28:32.922
- What did you say to her? - What do you think? With money.

00:28:33.452 --> 00:28:35.322
I offered her a million dollars, and she just snatched it up.

00:28:39.632 --> 00:28:40.662
Really?

00:28:41.092 --> 00:28:44.262
- Did Eun Oh really take the money? - Why?

00:28:44.532 --> 00:28:46.302
Did you think she was above taking it?

00:28:49.902 --> 00:28:53.912
So, don't feel burdened by Eun Oh anymore. We paid her.

00:28:55.342 --> 00:28:58.242
Instead, focus on recovering quickly and going back to the US.

00:28:58.942 --> 00:29:01.912
Finish your last semester strong and keep your grades up.

00:29:03.822 --> 00:29:06.822
For some reason, Seong Jae isn't the same person he used to be.

00:29:07.522 --> 00:29:10.862
Chairman Park promoted Seong Jae to Vice President.

00:29:12.092 --> 00:29:14.592
He's not the mess he used to be.

00:29:17.962 --> 00:29:20.632
So, you need to get your act together.

00:29:23.872 --> 00:29:25.242
Don't forget...

00:29:25.242 --> 00:29:27.912
the lengths I went to in order to save you.

00:29:28.312 --> 00:29:29.312
Got it?

00:29:45.522 --> 00:29:46.762
Hey, why are you on your laptop?

00:29:47.562 --> 00:29:49.292
Aren't you supposed to be studying for your certification?

00:29:49.632 --> 00:29:52.602
No. This is something else. A side hustle.

00:29:54.572 --> 00:29:55.572
What kind of side hustle?

00:29:56.542 --> 00:30:00.412
I was looking up your webtoon, and I found a webtoon story contest.

00:30:00.512 --> 00:30:03.782
It's a contest for story pitches, and the prize is 10,000 dollars.

00:30:04.682 --> 00:30:06.482
So you're writing a story for it?

00:30:06.482 --> 00:30:09.622
Yes. I actually had a story in mind,

00:30:09.782 --> 00:30:10.782
so I thought I'd give it a shot.

00:30:13.292 --> 00:30:14.292
What's it about?

00:30:14.552 --> 00:30:16.262
Hey, that's a secret.

00:30:17.192 --> 00:30:20.632
I could help you, you know. Since you helped me.

00:30:21.632 --> 00:30:22.632
Really?

00:30:23.702 --> 00:30:25.362
You know the story of Rapunzel, right?

00:30:26.332 --> 00:30:28.202
You mean Rapunzel, locked away in her tower?

00:30:28.272 --> 00:30:32.202
Yes. This is a modern-day version of Rapunzel.

00:30:32.472 --> 00:30:35.472
There's this girl. At first,

00:30:35.542 --> 00:30:38.942
she's so clueless about the world that you'd think she's a brat.

00:30:39.342 --> 00:30:42.552
She can't make her own decisions, and she's a total coward.

00:30:42.982 --> 00:30:47.192
But deep down inside, she has this fiery...

00:30:47.252 --> 00:30:48.592
spark in her.

00:30:49.762 --> 00:30:53.032
So why was she living like such a spoiled, clueless brat?

00:30:54.092 --> 00:30:56.332
Because there was a witch who raised her to be that way.

00:30:57.162 --> 00:30:58.962
So it really is a modern-day Rapunzel.

00:30:59.402 --> 00:31:03.202
- And then what? - Then, she meets a bodyguard.

00:31:03.372 --> 00:31:07.242
The bodyguard plays the role of Rapunzel's long hair.

00:31:07.612 --> 00:31:10.612
Anyway, it's about her trying to escape.

00:31:11.742 --> 00:31:12.812
A bodyguard?

00:31:14.812 --> 00:31:15.812
Wait.

00:31:16.522 --> 00:31:17.822
Isn't this about me?

00:31:18.322 --> 00:31:19.592
This sounds like my mom and me.

00:31:20.492 --> 00:31:21.492
You think so?

00:31:21.792 --> 00:31:26.392
But in the story, the two of them escape the mansion in the woods,

00:31:26.462 --> 00:31:30.062
and they make it out of the forest, despite all the obstacles. See?

00:31:30.062 --> 00:31:31.162
That's different from your story, right?

00:31:33.202 --> 00:31:34.202
That sounds interesting.

00:31:35.302 --> 00:31:38.102
You inspired it, so if it wins, I'll give you half,

00:31:38.172 --> 00:31:39.172
which is 5,000 dollars.

00:31:41.012 --> 00:31:43.012
I bet I could do a great job illustrating it.

00:31:43.412 --> 00:31:46.612
Go ahead and work on it. I'm going to step out for one hour.

00:31:51.582 --> 00:31:53.192
(Resignation Letter)

00:31:53.652 --> 00:31:54.992
This is my letter of resignation.

00:31:55.952 --> 00:31:57.262
A resignation letter?

00:31:58.192 --> 00:32:00.232
The stalker Yang Ji Il's first trial verdict...

00:32:00.232 --> 00:32:02.492
is in mid-January.

00:32:03.632 --> 00:32:06.472
Once the verdict is delivered and he's in custody,

00:32:06.672 --> 00:32:08.632
your daughter won't need a bodyguard anymore.

00:32:11.542 --> 00:32:15.772
I offered you the job of running our employee fitness center.

00:32:17.082 --> 00:32:19.782
I wouldn't want to impose.

00:32:20.252 --> 00:32:21.252
Impose?

00:32:21.582 --> 00:32:23.352
It's a position we need to fill for the company.

00:32:25.922 --> 00:32:26.922
Is that so?

00:32:27.752 --> 00:32:29.022
The thing is,

00:32:29.352 --> 00:32:31.622
I'm planning to join a security firm.

00:32:32.562 --> 00:32:36.192
Working as a bodyguard, I realised that protecting people...

00:32:36.362 --> 00:32:38.602
is a really good fit for me.

00:32:39.332 --> 00:32:40.472
A security firm?

00:32:41.002 --> 00:32:44.402
That's why I'm studying for my official certification.

00:32:56.982 --> 00:32:58.122
Grandma.

00:33:00.092 --> 00:33:02.592
I still haven't heard from Seong Jae at all.

00:33:04.522 --> 00:33:07.062
You always liked Seong Jae.

00:33:08.732 --> 00:33:12.762
If you were here, I know you would've helped me.

00:33:17.342 --> 00:33:18.902
I miss you so much.

00:33:32.382 --> 00:33:34.852
Have them redo the graph for refunds and exchange fluctuations.

00:33:34.922 --> 00:33:37.222
And separate the data for domestic and international stores.

00:33:37.292 --> 00:33:38.562
Yes, sir.

00:33:45.262 --> 00:33:47.432
If you want to date Su Bin for even 100 days,

00:33:47.932 --> 00:33:49.502
you get your father's permission first.

00:34:00.252 --> 00:34:01.252
Grandma...

00:34:10.692 --> 00:34:11.862
My father's permission?

00:34:21.232 --> 00:34:23.642
So please, Ji Hyuk.

00:34:23.842 --> 00:34:25.502
Can't you just cut me some slack this once?

00:34:27.012 --> 00:34:28.112
This is driving me crazy.

00:34:29.212 --> 00:34:31.842
I need to make them break up before Mom and Dad find out.

00:34:34.482 --> 00:34:35.482
Yes.

00:34:35.552 --> 00:34:39.382
(Apfel Kitchen)

00:34:40.452 --> 00:34:41.922
Here is your off-site schedule for next week.

00:34:42.592 --> 00:34:44.222
You'll tour Factory One...

00:34:44.222 --> 00:34:46.292
and meet the general managers of each showroom.

00:34:46.932 --> 00:34:48.332
Here's the requested data...

00:34:48.332 --> 00:34:51.732
on B2B and B2C sales changes by material.

00:34:53.432 --> 00:34:54.502
Cheol Min?

00:34:55.132 --> 00:34:56.742
"Do it! Don't do it!"

00:34:57.272 --> 00:34:59.372
Let's say phrases like that are off-limits.

00:34:59.702 --> 00:35:02.912
On a scale of strong, medium, and weak,

00:35:02.912 --> 00:35:05.182
at what point do you think it could be stopped?

00:35:05.442 --> 00:35:08.412
- What's your gut feeling on that? - "Do it."

00:35:09.282 --> 00:35:11.222
"Don't do it."

00:35:11.222 --> 00:35:12.922
Is it within your rights to say that?

00:35:18.492 --> 00:35:21.392
I can't give you a proper read on it without knowing that, Mr. Lee.

00:35:25.432 --> 00:35:27.302
The right to say that?

00:35:29.232 --> 00:35:30.372
I think I have that right.

00:35:32.002 --> 00:35:33.002
Don't I?

00:35:39.212 --> 00:35:42.982
- His resignation letter? - Yes. He came by the office today.

00:35:43.482 --> 00:35:45.852
He'll only work until Yang Ji Il's initial verdict is out.

00:35:46.452 --> 00:35:47.792
Since it's a sure thing he'll be locked up.

00:35:48.392 --> 00:35:50.022
So he really submitted his resignation?

00:35:50.922 --> 00:35:53.962
- And you accepted it? - I did.

00:35:54.432 --> 00:35:57.462
I even offered him the job at our employee fitness center,

00:35:57.762 --> 00:35:58.762
but he turned that down too.

00:35:59.302 --> 00:36:00.672
He says he wants to join a security firm.

00:36:01.302 --> 00:36:02.732
Apparently, he enjoyed being a bodyguard.

00:36:03.972 --> 00:36:05.402
That can't be right.

00:36:07.172 --> 00:36:10.642
He was very clear and firm about resigning before he left.

00:36:11.342 --> 00:36:13.312
There's no need for you to get all worked up about it.

00:36:21.992 --> 00:36:23.192
Just give me two months.

00:36:24.622 --> 00:36:27.462
It's just that I really want to see this through to the end.

00:36:28.192 --> 00:36:30.932
Just let me do this one thing, and I'll do whatever you want.

00:36:31.962 --> 00:36:33.572
Was it really just about the webtoon?

00:36:35.672 --> 00:36:38.102
She wouldn't dare try to fool Chairman Park.

00:37:05.932 --> 00:37:08.172
Hey. What are you doing here?

00:37:09.102 --> 00:37:10.442
It's way too early for you to be at the office.

00:37:11.142 --> 00:37:12.142
Hey, what's with you?

00:37:13.002 --> 00:37:16.172
Do you just barge into my office whenever I'm not here?

00:37:17.042 --> 00:37:18.242
What, me?

00:37:18.982 --> 00:37:21.652
No, I just came in because I had to do something before you got here.

00:37:22.682 --> 00:37:24.952
This is a welcome-back-to-work gift.

00:37:25.322 --> 00:37:27.322
And these are some snacks.

00:37:27.992 --> 00:37:28.992
And this is...

00:37:31.022 --> 00:37:32.022
an air purifier.

00:37:32.562 --> 00:37:34.062
Since it's hard to get fresh air in the winter.

00:37:36.762 --> 00:37:39.302
This is a lot for a company perk, isn't it?

00:37:40.472 --> 00:37:41.472
It's not a company perk.

00:37:41.872 --> 00:37:43.602
I bought all of this with my own money.

00:37:44.342 --> 00:37:45.742
With some ulterior motives, of course.

00:37:49.712 --> 00:37:53.712
And one more thing. Can you please not come in so early?

00:37:56.312 --> 00:37:58.422
(Apel Kitchen)

00:38:00.352 --> 00:38:02.692
That guy's so shameless and slick.

00:38:35.692 --> 00:38:37.662
Ms. Ji, the CEO would like to see you in his office.

00:38:37.892 --> 00:38:40.832
(Apfel Kitchen)

00:38:45.802 --> 00:38:46.802
Why are you standing?

00:38:47.832 --> 00:38:50.872
You've been sitting since 7am.

00:38:51.342 --> 00:38:54.772
So, what's more comfortable for you? Standing or sitting?

00:38:55.142 --> 00:38:56.242
I have something to discuss.

00:38:56.942 --> 00:38:58.842
You're okay with having a meeting while standing?

00:38:59.712 --> 00:39:02.312
Call it a tailor-made service for my partner.

00:39:04.252 --> 00:39:05.782
I'll stand, then.

00:39:06.322 --> 00:39:07.322
Go ahead.

00:39:07.792 --> 00:39:08.792
The thing is...

00:39:09.122 --> 00:39:12.022
I was hoping you would take on the model home project.

00:39:13.732 --> 00:39:16.392
So you're asking me to join AP?

00:39:16.962 --> 00:39:19.002
AP isn't really structured for partnerships.

00:39:19.732 --> 00:39:20.772
What if I say no?

00:39:21.602 --> 00:39:22.602
Then...

00:39:22.932 --> 00:39:24.802
I guess you'd have to go independent with Eunoism.

00:39:25.442 --> 00:39:28.572
But I feel that instead of running around job sites,

00:39:28.642 --> 00:39:31.442
your real talent lies in design.

00:39:32.382 --> 00:39:33.382
That's why...

00:39:35.082 --> 00:39:37.322
I want you to be AP's Head of Design.

00:39:37.852 --> 00:39:38.852
I really hope you will.

00:39:41.692 --> 00:39:42.752
I'll think about it.

00:39:43.322 --> 00:39:44.322
Okay.

00:39:52.902 --> 00:39:54.232
What if she says she wants to go independent?

00:40:04.712 --> 00:40:05.712
Sang Cheol.

00:40:06.982 --> 00:40:08.012
Don't...

00:40:08.912 --> 00:40:10.752
run yourself ragged like this.

00:40:12.282 --> 00:40:13.722
For 33 years,

00:40:14.722 --> 00:40:16.122
you've been the man of the house.

00:40:17.762 --> 00:40:19.962
But I can't just let it all go.

00:40:21.232 --> 00:40:24.702
If I live to be your age, Mom, I've still got another 25 years.

00:40:26.002 --> 00:40:27.002
Mom.

00:40:27.732 --> 00:40:31.042
Am I ever going to get a job as a technician at this rate?

00:40:32.472 --> 00:40:33.472
What am I going to do then?

00:40:35.612 --> 00:40:37.012
What do you mean, "What am I going to do?"

00:40:37.712 --> 00:40:39.712
You just have to keep at it, you fool. Man up.

00:40:41.552 --> 00:40:43.882
Oh! The Spring.

00:40:44.482 --> 00:40:46.822
Wait, until I get a job, I could follow her around...

00:40:47.122 --> 00:40:48.692
and learn a thing or two about interior design.

00:40:49.752 --> 00:40:53.092
It has been a while since I last contacted her.

00:40:55.462 --> 00:40:56.592
Gosh, that scared me. What is this?

00:40:57.002 --> 00:40:59.002
Mr. Early, how have you been?

00:41:00.272 --> 00:41:01.872
What a surprise.

00:41:02.202 --> 00:41:03.402
(The Spring)

00:41:03.502 --> 00:41:05.102
I know it's been a while, hasn't it?

00:41:05.472 --> 00:41:07.342
I've been going through some wild stuff.

00:41:07.912 --> 00:41:11.482
I even had major surgery. Curious?

00:41:11.942 --> 00:41:13.012
Can you spare some time for me?

00:41:13.482 --> 00:41:16.182
I need to vent, and I need some advice.

00:41:16.282 --> 00:41:19.282
Man, how are we always so in sync?

00:41:19.922 --> 00:41:21.422
And she's so young... My gosh.

00:41:22.852 --> 00:41:23.962
(Personal Information)

00:41:25.562 --> 00:41:27.592
Just as you predicted, he's been seeing a woman.

00:41:27.992 --> 00:41:30.432
Since we were short on time, I only looked into the key details.

00:41:38.542 --> 00:41:39.872
(Personal Information: Lee Su Bin, Age 24)

00:41:41.142 --> 00:41:42.742
(YouTuber)

00:41:42.942 --> 00:41:45.842
A 24-year-old YouTuber?

00:41:48.082 --> 00:41:50.052
She's probably just full of herself.

00:41:53.122 --> 00:41:54.992
So, a pretty young thing...

00:41:55.692 --> 00:41:57.792
latched onto a divorced guy for his money.

00:42:04.832 --> 00:42:06.262
Well, Seong Jae.

00:42:07.632 --> 00:42:10.202
You're doing a great job getting on your father's bad side yourself.

00:42:26.222 --> 00:42:27.292
Did you lock the door?

00:42:28.192 --> 00:42:30.592
Get out. Now. Before I have you thrown out.

00:42:32.162 --> 00:42:33.932
That guy is her brother?

00:42:38.832 --> 00:42:40.132
That's right. The CEO.

00:42:42.532 --> 00:42:44.272
The one who knows everything about me and Ji Eun Oh?

00:42:47.842 --> 00:42:48.972
He's her brother?

00:42:51.242 --> 00:42:52.942
And Seong Jae is dating that little brat?

00:43:01.792 --> 00:43:02.792
What is it?

00:43:02.852 --> 00:43:04.722
(Shoealls)

00:43:04.862 --> 00:43:05.862
Father.

00:43:08.132 --> 00:43:09.132
I...

00:43:09.962 --> 00:43:11.362
There's someone I care about.

00:43:12.332 --> 00:43:14.832
And I'm dating her.

00:43:15.632 --> 00:43:16.632
What?

00:43:18.472 --> 00:43:19.772
For now, we're just dating.

00:43:21.512 --> 00:43:22.512
"For now?"

00:43:23.442 --> 00:43:24.442
"Just dating?"

00:43:26.382 --> 00:43:28.882
So you're telling me to stop setting you up on dates?

00:43:30.452 --> 00:43:31.452
Yes.

00:43:32.282 --> 00:43:33.822
This time, please just let me be.

00:43:34.722 --> 00:43:35.722
I'm asking you, please.

00:43:38.722 --> 00:43:41.132
It sounds like this isn't just a casual relationship.

00:43:42.992 --> 00:43:46.102
What does she do? And her family? I don't even have to ask, do I?

00:43:46.602 --> 00:43:49.802
All that talk about just dating and so on.

00:43:49.802 --> 00:43:50.872
It's a smokescreen for her family, right?

00:43:51.502 --> 00:43:53.812
No. I'm telling you we're dating...

00:43:54.712 --> 00:43:56.372
because that's exactly what we're doing.

00:43:56.642 --> 00:43:59.112
I'm telling you this so you won't interfere.

00:44:00.552 --> 00:44:03.552
I have no intention of marrying the person you choose for me.

00:44:04.752 --> 00:44:07.122
Just like you married my stepmother for love,

00:44:07.892 --> 00:44:09.222
don't I have that right as well?

00:44:09.992 --> 00:44:12.862
So you're saying you intend to marry this girl?

00:44:13.832 --> 00:44:14.832
Who knows?

00:44:15.492 --> 00:44:16.492
Would she...

00:44:17.432 --> 00:44:19.332
even want to marry someone like me?

00:44:20.432 --> 00:44:22.532
- What? - I already told you.

00:44:23.332 --> 00:44:24.572
We're just dating.

00:44:27.372 --> 00:44:29.442
I'm telling you this so you'll stay out of it.

00:44:30.342 --> 00:44:31.842
I'm asking you. Please.

00:44:33.642 --> 00:44:34.752
And if I refuse?

00:44:39.152 --> 00:44:42.222
Fine. Take a day to think about it and give me your answer.

00:44:43.122 --> 00:44:44.322
And I will give you my answer then as well.

00:44:45.922 --> 00:44:50.232
(Shoealls)

00:44:54.802 --> 00:44:55.802
What's gotten into him?

00:45:05.582 --> 00:45:06.882
Did something happen?

00:45:07.852 --> 00:45:09.312
Seong Jae...

00:45:10.682 --> 00:45:11.882
says he's seeing someone.

00:45:12.422 --> 00:45:13.652
Out of the blue, he asked for my blessing.

00:45:14.292 --> 00:45:15.552
He told him already?

00:45:17.022 --> 00:45:18.362
Really?

00:45:19.692 --> 00:45:22.032
He should've told us if he was seeing someone.

00:45:22.532 --> 00:45:25.432
And I was pushing him to date, not knowing a thing.

00:45:26.062 --> 00:45:27.372
I need you to look into it.

00:45:28.072 --> 00:45:31.972
All this talk about "just dating" means she's not from a good family.

00:45:32.842 --> 00:45:36.542
But it's the first time he's brought up a woman himself,

00:45:36.542 --> 00:45:37.612
so it bothers me.

00:45:39.482 --> 00:45:41.652
- Okay. - Thanks.

00:45:54.632 --> 00:45:56.862
He told him to stay out of it because they're just dating?

00:45:58.032 --> 00:45:59.662
And he was the one who brought her up?

00:46:00.332 --> 00:46:02.932
Of all people, it had to be that jerk's sister.

00:46:03.672 --> 00:46:06.072
Get out. Now. Before I have you thrown out.

00:46:06.842 --> 00:46:09.872
If he learns I'm Seong Jae's mother, he'll tell Seong Jae immediately,

00:46:10.342 --> 00:46:12.412
and Seong Jae will go straight to Park Jin Seok.

00:46:13.282 --> 00:46:16.182
Then everything about Woo Jin will be exposed too.

00:46:16.752 --> 00:46:18.122
There's no way out of this.

00:46:34.432 --> 00:46:36.872
Why do I get the feeling she's looking at me?

00:46:42.412 --> 00:46:43.412
Me?

00:46:49.182 --> 00:46:51.082
I've never seen her before. Who is she?

00:46:54.892 --> 00:46:55.992
Hello, Su Bin.

00:46:57.152 --> 00:46:58.162
Who are you?

00:47:01.462 --> 00:47:02.592
I'm Seong Jae's mother.

00:47:10.332 --> 00:47:11.702
You're quite pretty.

00:47:13.002 --> 00:47:14.172
And so young.

00:47:14.712 --> 00:47:16.242
I suppose that's what men like about you.

00:47:20.912 --> 00:47:22.612
I assume you know why I'm here.

00:47:24.022 --> 00:47:25.222
I'm afraid I don't.

00:47:26.922 --> 00:47:29.322
My son, Seong Jae, is divorced,

00:47:29.592 --> 00:47:32.922
nine years older, and the eldest son of the Shoe Joy Group.

00:47:33.222 --> 00:47:37.132
And he has a duty to marry a woman who is suitable for our family.

00:47:38.032 --> 00:47:39.332
Are you aware of all this?

00:47:40.702 --> 00:47:43.772
I knew everything but the marriage part.

00:47:44.872 --> 00:47:46.772
That happens to be the most important part.

00:47:48.542 --> 00:47:50.272
The woman my Seong Jae marries...

00:47:50.712 --> 00:47:52.812
will be chosen by his father and me.

00:47:54.482 --> 00:47:56.052
And it's not going to be you.

00:47:58.382 --> 00:48:01.122
I've never said I was going to marry him.

00:48:02.392 --> 00:48:06.322
Really? Then why are you seeing him? At your pretty, young age.

00:48:06.692 --> 00:48:08.832
What, just for fun?

00:48:09.732 --> 00:48:13.362
At Seong Jae's age, am I to believe it's just casual dating?

00:48:14.332 --> 00:48:16.332
We haven't been seeing each other for very long.

00:48:16.602 --> 00:48:18.042
We're just casually dating.

00:48:18.802 --> 00:48:22.842
So you'll just date for a while, and then break up?

00:48:23.272 --> 00:48:25.512
Well, in that case, I misunderstood.

00:48:26.042 --> 00:48:27.852
And here I was, worried that...

00:48:28.112 --> 00:48:30.482
this would make Seong Jae lose favour with the Chairman.

00:48:32.022 --> 00:48:34.452
Then would you like to sign an agreement?

00:48:35.152 --> 00:48:37.792
- An agreement? - What would be a good end date?

00:48:38.492 --> 00:48:40.832
Let's make it a clean break by the end of the year.

00:48:41.262 --> 00:48:43.162
We can even agree on a settlement amount.

00:48:44.202 --> 00:48:46.662
Oh, I should have picked a cafe.

00:48:49.002 --> 00:48:51.002
I won't be signing any agreement.

00:48:54.412 --> 00:48:56.812
- Why not? - Because there's no reason to.

00:48:58.242 --> 00:49:01.082
How long we date and whether we end up getting married...

00:49:01.982 --> 00:49:04.922
Isn't that for Seong Jae and me to decide first?

00:49:06.182 --> 00:49:07.452
I knew it.

00:49:08.492 --> 00:49:11.892
Hey, are you really with Seong Jae because you like him?

00:49:12.762 --> 00:49:15.192
It's not Seong Jae himself you want, is it?

00:49:15.532 --> 00:49:16.932
It's Seong Jae with money.

00:49:18.432 --> 00:49:21.432
But you can never have them both.

00:49:22.972 --> 00:49:25.342
Choose. Which will it be?

00:49:29.812 --> 00:49:30.812
Seong Jae.

00:49:32.482 --> 00:49:33.482
What did you say?

00:49:34.512 --> 00:49:36.182
For you to be this bold in front of his mother,

00:49:36.612 --> 00:49:38.422
you're quite a piece of work.

00:49:38.852 --> 00:49:40.552
You're the kind of girl who'll ruin my son!

00:49:41.392 --> 00:49:44.492
She would smile, but she was like thin ice.

00:49:45.192 --> 00:49:47.592
But you're not even Seong Jae's real mother.

00:49:50.192 --> 00:49:51.202
What?

00:49:55.532 --> 00:49:56.702
Why you little...

00:50:04.412 --> 00:50:08.152
My birth mother had an affair and left my dad when I was four.

00:50:09.512 --> 00:50:11.682
My current mother came into our lives when I was five.

00:50:12.982 --> 00:50:13.982
How should I put it?

00:50:16.052 --> 00:50:17.052
Not even for a single moment...

00:50:17.822 --> 00:50:19.562
was she ever a real mother to me.

00:50:23.992 --> 00:50:25.262
How could she be like that?

00:50:26.132 --> 00:50:28.172
She's raised you since you were five.

00:50:29.732 --> 00:50:30.842
Some people are just like that.

00:50:32.172 --> 00:50:34.142
That's why I'm so fond of your parents.

00:50:35.442 --> 00:50:36.442
I bet...

00:50:36.812 --> 00:50:39.682
I got more love from your mother than I ever did from mine.

00:50:43.482 --> 00:50:47.052
So, were you mistreated growing up?

00:50:49.252 --> 00:50:50.822
If she had at least mistreated me,

00:50:51.992 --> 00:50:53.592
my father would have noticed.

00:50:57.392 --> 00:50:58.402
She would smile,

00:50:59.432 --> 00:51:01.172
but she was like thin ice.

00:51:03.332 --> 00:51:05.872
Someone can smile and be like thin ice?

00:51:07.872 --> 00:51:08.872
Let go of me!

00:51:09.612 --> 00:51:12.712
My mom, my dad, my brothers,

00:51:14.312 --> 00:51:15.312
and my grandmother...

00:51:16.282 --> 00:51:17.622
all love me dearly. I'm precious to them,

00:51:18.822 --> 00:51:20.152
so don't you dare treat me like this again.

00:51:25.162 --> 00:51:28.632
I raised him since he was five. So I'm not his real mother?

00:51:29.762 --> 00:51:31.102
I am Seong Jae's mother.

00:51:31.532 --> 00:51:35.102
- And I'm Chairman Park's wife! - If you were Seong Jae's mother,

00:51:35.802 --> 00:51:37.132
you wouldn't have laid a hand...

00:51:38.042 --> 00:51:39.802
on the woman your son loves.

00:51:41.112 --> 00:51:42.672
She's got quite a backbone.

00:51:44.312 --> 00:51:46.482
If you're finished, I'll be going now.

00:51:50.352 --> 00:51:51.822
Fine. Then listen to what I really have to say.

00:51:56.752 --> 00:51:57.762
Go ahead.

00:52:00.562 --> 00:52:01.692
Seong Jae's first marriage.

00:52:02.662 --> 00:52:04.502
Seong Jae's father forced him to get a divorce.

00:52:05.602 --> 00:52:06.862
Even though they were already legally married.

00:52:08.232 --> 00:52:11.142
For the heir of a conglomerate, marriage isn't a personal matter.

00:52:11.542 --> 00:52:13.872
It's a business arrangement with a family that aids the company.

00:52:21.652 --> 00:52:24.822
Seong Jae's father will never give up on him.

00:52:25.822 --> 00:52:30.322
I know. That's why I stepped in now, before you both get hurt even more.

00:52:31.192 --> 00:52:34.292
As his mother, it would be easier on my Seong Jae...

00:52:34.962 --> 00:52:37.032
if you were the one to end things.

00:52:37.762 --> 00:52:40.162
Do you understand me?

00:52:40.632 --> 00:52:42.432
I understand what you mean.

00:52:44.642 --> 00:52:46.142
Please, be realistic.

00:52:47.042 --> 00:52:50.842
Chairman Park will stop at nothing when it comes to Seong Jae.

00:52:52.212 --> 00:52:53.712
It won't just be you.

00:52:55.182 --> 00:52:57.082
Your family will be in danger, too.

00:53:03.692 --> 00:53:06.522
If you truly love Seong Jae, let him go.

00:53:08.062 --> 00:53:09.432
Because of your relationship with him,

00:53:09.862 --> 00:53:11.802
do you want him to be disowned by his family?

00:53:13.032 --> 00:53:15.672
Do you want Seong Jae to lose everything?

00:53:18.542 --> 00:53:19.942
Because true love means...

00:53:20.802 --> 00:53:22.712
wanting the other person to be happy.

00:53:25.082 --> 00:53:26.512
Please, make the right decision.

You're asking me to be a model?

00:54:09.352 --> 00:54:13.122
- Grandma got her first model job. - Left side, pose.

00:54:13.792 --> 00:54:15.492

cried so much making this.

I've come for your answer, Father.

What if the answer is no?

00:55:27.662 --> 00:55:28.872
I'll resign.

00:55:33.942 --> 00:55:34.972
You'll resign?

00:55:36.242 --> 00:55:39.542
I'll return all the company stock you gave me.

00:55:41.712 --> 00:55:43.052
And to think you said you were just dating.

00:55:43.452 --> 00:55:45.282
You're willing to give up everything and walk out?

00:55:45.982 --> 00:55:47.922
I'm saying I'll leave your company.

00:55:49.522 --> 00:55:51.662
I'll focus on growing Next Labs,

the company I started with the money from Grandpa.

00:55:54.122 --> 00:55:55.662
Besides, I'm more interested in investing.

00:55:58.602 --> 00:56:03.332
So now that you have your own money, you think you can do as you please?

No.

I'm saying you can't control me with your money anymore.

00:56:13.982 --> 00:56:15.282
This isn't about marriage, is it?

00:56:16.782 --> 00:56:18.552
Right. We're just dating.

00:56:19.682 --> 00:56:20.722
For now.

But I really have to get going right now.

- I just came back to get my phone. - I make you uncomfortable, right?

00:57:43.332 --> 00:57:46.102
Showing up right after your surgery when you couldn't even move,

00:57:47.242 --> 00:57:48.772
hanging around your hospital room,

00:57:50.572 --> 00:57:52.342
telling you I can't give up on you,

00:57:53.812 --> 00:57:54.882
and now...

00:57:55.982 --> 00:57:57.482
asking you to join my company.

00:58:01.122 --> 00:58:04.192
Why are you saying all this all of a sudden?

00:58:04.722 --> 00:58:06.792
There's something I've been meaning to tell you,

00:58:08.432 --> 00:58:09.532
and I'm going to say it now.

00:58:14.162 --> 00:58:15.732
I've been a real jerk.

00:58:19.202 --> 00:58:20.372
Eun Oh, I...

00:58:21.672 --> 00:58:23.912
When I decided to marry Jung Bo A,

00:58:25.582 --> 00:58:28.052
I truly thought it was a win-win marriage.

00:58:30.182 --> 00:58:32.252
She had what I lacked,

00:58:33.652 --> 00:58:35.092
and she needed me.

00:58:37.152 --> 00:58:40.822
So I truly believed I wasn't doing anything wrong.

00:58:46.132 --> 00:58:47.802
I know that's what you thought.

00:58:49.202 --> 00:58:50.202
But...

00:58:50.732 --> 00:58:53.842
- why are you saying this now? - But I overlooked something.

00:58:56.172 --> 00:58:57.372
The fact that Jung Bo A was still...

00:58:58.942 --> 00:59:00.782
in love with another man.

00:59:04.212 --> 00:59:05.852
And even though I knew all that,

00:59:07.552 --> 00:59:09.022
I was still going to marry her.

00:59:11.522 --> 00:59:13.292
A real jerk who was just in it for the money.

00:59:14.962 --> 00:59:15.962
That was me.

00:59:20.562 --> 00:59:22.002
And you're only just now realising that?

00:59:22.172 --> 00:59:24.232
So I can only imagine how much you must've despised me.

00:59:26.072 --> 00:59:27.972
And yet, I showed up at your cafe...

00:59:27.972 --> 00:59:30.242
trying to come back and bothering you.

00:59:32.742 --> 00:59:33.742
In the process...

00:59:36.212 --> 00:59:37.512
I ended up falling for you.

00:59:44.862 --> 00:59:45.922
As for that,

00:59:47.022 --> 00:59:49.262
I already gave you my answer back then.

00:59:50.832 --> 00:59:52.332
You're just pathetic.

00:59:52.832 --> 00:59:54.702
What's the point of you liking me now?

00:59:55.232 --> 00:59:58.172
It's all pointless now. That kind of person...

00:59:58.872 --> 00:59:59.902
I can't stand them.

00:59:59.902 --> 01:00:02.212
Someone who would marry without love for money...

01:00:02.272 --> 01:00:04.072
I despise people like that.

01:00:07.282 --> 01:00:08.312
You did.

01:00:10.012 --> 01:00:12.922
That our values are too different,

01:00:13.722 --> 01:00:15.222
so we're a terrible match.

01:00:17.422 --> 01:00:19.792
I told you we were beyond repair.

01:00:21.992 --> 01:00:23.032
But...

01:00:26.462 --> 01:00:27.462
Eun Oh.

01:00:31.502 --> 01:00:32.942
I really think...

01:00:34.912 --> 01:00:36.312
you're the only one for me, for as long as I live.

01:00:39.682 --> 01:00:41.812
How can I earn your forgiveness?

01:00:45.422 --> 01:00:46.552
Can you please tell me?

01:00:48.592 --> 01:00:49.592
What I have to do...

01:00:51.692 --> 01:00:53.322
to earn your forgiveness.

01:00:59.132 --> 01:01:01.032
Watching you go through surgery this time...

01:01:03.172 --> 01:01:04.532
made me realise it for sure.

01:01:08.242 --> 01:01:09.542
I just can't let you go.

01:01:15.182 --> 01:01:17.112
You're so shameless.

01:01:18.852 --> 01:01:20.552
After getting your way with everything,

01:01:21.182 --> 01:01:23.122
now you're trying to get your way with me too.

01:01:24.962 --> 01:01:26.162
The reasons this won't work between us...

01:01:27.162 --> 01:01:28.632
I've explained them more than enough.

01:01:31.902 --> 01:01:32.962
I'm sorry.

01:01:35.672 --> 01:01:36.732
I really am.

01:01:40.042 --> 01:01:41.142
I'm truly sorry.

01:01:46.282 --> 01:01:47.742
I want you to forgive me.

01:01:59.892 --> 01:02:01.162
You said it yourself, right?

01:02:03.432 --> 01:02:06.002
"I'm going to do everything I can for you."

01:02:07.102 --> 01:02:08.272
"And you do whatever you want."

01:02:11.132 --> 01:02:12.302
Fine, let's do that.

01:02:14.502 --> 01:02:15.512
Because I'm...

01:02:16.372 --> 01:02:17.972
going to do exactly what I want, too.

01:02:22.412 --> 01:02:23.512
I have to be somewhere.

01:02:25.082 --> 01:02:26.082
Right.

01:02:26.822 --> 01:02:27.822
You...

01:02:28.752 --> 01:02:29.822
You just told me...

01:02:30.422 --> 01:02:31.892
to do whatever I want, didn't you?

01:02:33.222 --> 01:02:34.592
Then that's exactly what I'll do.

01:02:51.912 --> 01:02:52.912
What?

01:02:55.952 --> 01:02:56.952
What a klutz.

01:02:57.882 --> 01:02:59.122
Especially when it's so cold out.

01:03:02.292 --> 01:03:04.152
What? Did she grab a cab already?

01:03:08.392 --> 01:03:09.992
She's taking the bus?

01:03:13.902 --> 01:03:15.172
Eun Oh, you dropped this...

01:03:29.352 --> 01:03:30.952
What? Dad!

01:03:32.952 --> 01:03:33.982
Dad?

01:03:34.582 --> 01:03:37.292
- Mr. Early, you're his dad? - What?

01:03:39.262 --> 01:03:40.822
Wait, "Mr. Early?"

01:03:41.932 --> 01:03:45.732
Hold on, you know my father?

01:04:30.512 --> 01:04:32.782
(Our Golden Days)

01:04:33.442 --> 01:04:34.442
I love you.

01:04:34.512 --> 01:04:37.882
Marriage? A hundred days turn into a year, then two years.

01:04:37.952 --> 01:04:39.552
And who knows? We might actually get married.

01:04:39.652 --> 01:04:43.792
- Actually, I met that young lady. - She's a feisty one, isn't she?

01:04:43.992 --> 01:04:46.592
Why should I have to tell you about my friends?

01:04:46.662 --> 01:04:48.022
Come out, you punk.

01:04:48.292 --> 01:04:52.502
- You have a crush on her, right? - Dad!

01:04:52.562 --> 01:04:55.032
Honey, you really get a kick out of teasing Ji Hyuk.

01:04:55.102 --> 01:04:57.602
- You got this, right? - You got this, too, right?

01:04:57.672 --> 01:04:59.902
I'm the architect of this project.

01:05:00.402 --> 01:05:02.142
There's someone I want to go see...
