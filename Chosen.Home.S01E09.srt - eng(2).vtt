00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:06.578
Gentle-hearted gay man Genichi Hatano

00:00:06.644 --> 00:00:08.513
and his partner, Saku Sakuta,

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.748
struggles to find a home
to serve as a "clamp."

00:00:10.815 --> 00:00:13.551
Hotaru has finally found a dream
in making guitars,

00:00:13.618 --> 00:00:15.687
but their fake relationship
is discovered by the police,

00:00:15.753 --> 00:00:18.056
and she’s sent to a child guidance center.

00:00:18.123 --> 00:00:20.592
Meanwhile, Hotaru’s mother, Tomoe,

00:00:20.658 --> 00:00:24.028
had her bag stolen,
along with all her keychains.

00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:26.030
Her dad, Jin Ichigaya, though,

00:00:26.097 --> 00:00:28.333
has made off with the 30 million
from Genichi’s apartment.

00:00:30.168 --> 00:00:32.770
It’s gone! The 30 million yen…

00:00:32.837 --> 00:00:34.506
Stop following me!

00:00:34.572 --> 00:00:35.907
This is a crime!

00:00:35.974 --> 00:00:37.809
-You’re gonna get arrested!
-Shut up!

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.711
Hey!

00:00:39.777 --> 00:00:41.679
-Coming through!
-Watch out!

00:00:42.847 --> 00:00:44.082
Get out of our way!

00:00:46.151 --> 00:00:47.118
Huh?

00:00:47.752 --> 00:00:48.686
Hey!

00:00:49.254 --> 00:00:50.622
Where did he go?

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:52.957
Where are you?

00:00:53.658 --> 00:00:55.226
Hold it right there!

00:00:58.763 --> 00:01:00.899
Red means stop.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.535
You seem to be on the run.

00:01:04.035 --> 00:01:04.936
What?

00:01:05.703 --> 00:01:08.339
May I check what's inside?

00:01:08.973 --> 00:01:10.241
No.

00:01:10.308 --> 00:01:12.010
-Let me see it.
-I said no!

00:01:12.577 --> 00:01:14.212
Do you have any sort of ID on you?

00:01:14.712 --> 00:01:16.848
I’m not a suspicious person.

00:01:16.915 --> 00:01:17.949
Here you go.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:19.884
JIN ICHIGAYA

00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:22.220
-Mr. Jin Ichigaya.
-That's right.

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:27.358
And your ex-wife’s name is Tomoe Kusunoki?

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.596
Your daughter’s name is Hotaru Kusunoki?

00:01:32.497 --> 00:01:33.331
‎What?

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:36.734
If this little one is here,

00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:38.403
then he must be the one who did it.

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:39.671
He's not picking up.

00:01:39.737 --> 00:01:40.772
Everything is exposed,

00:01:40.838 --> 00:01:42.640
and on top of that,
the 30 million was stolen?

00:01:42.707 --> 00:01:45.009
I didn’t lock up properly.
I’m really sorry.

00:01:45.076 --> 00:01:47.178
It’s just 30 million yen.
Don’t have to apologize.

00:01:47.245 --> 00:01:48.513
"Just"?

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.381
The one at fault is my dad.

00:01:50.448 --> 00:01:52.417
And the one who embezzled is my mom.

00:01:52.483 --> 00:01:53.918
You don’t have to force yourself.

00:01:53.985 --> 00:01:55.987
I'm not though.

00:01:56.054 --> 00:01:57.021
Sorry to interrupt.

00:01:57.088 --> 00:01:59.557
Did you forget something?

00:01:59.624 --> 00:02:01.259
No. Hotaru?

00:02:01.826 --> 00:02:02.827
Yes?

00:02:04.028 --> 00:02:05.063
Please come out already.

00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:07.999
What?

00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:09.701
After stopping by here,

00:02:09.767 --> 00:02:11.970
I questioned this man.

00:02:12.036 --> 00:02:13.871
He goes by the name Jin Ichigaya,

00:02:13.938 --> 00:02:16.975
so I thought he might be Hotaru’s dad
and brought him here.

00:02:18.476 --> 00:02:20.278
He’s not my dad.

00:02:20.345 --> 00:02:21.679
He’s a thief.

00:02:21.746 --> 00:02:22.780
A thief?

00:02:22.847 --> 00:02:23.881
No, I'm not!

00:02:23.948 --> 00:02:25.583
Please give that back!

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.752
What? Does it belong to you, Mr. Sakuta?

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.454
Well, uh…

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.822
It’s mine. Mine. It’s mine!

00:02:30.888 --> 00:02:32.023
But it's not, right?

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.125
In any case, he’s not my dad.

00:02:35.426 --> 00:02:36.594
Is that right?

00:02:38.596 --> 00:02:40.832
-That’s a shame.
-What?

00:02:40.898 --> 00:02:44.402
If your real dad were here,
then we won’t need to question you

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:46.437
or report this to the school
or child guidance center.

00:02:46.504 --> 00:02:47.338
Really?

00:02:47.405 --> 00:02:48.706
-Oh?
-Oh my!

00:02:48.773 --> 00:02:50.041
Truly unfortunate.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.282
Looking closely, he is my dad.

00:02:57.348 --> 00:02:58.549
Huh?

00:02:58.616 --> 00:02:59.517
He's my dad after all.

00:02:59.584 --> 00:03:01.252
-What's this all of a sudden?
-Dad!

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.720
W-What is it?

00:03:02.787 --> 00:03:05.556
Why have you been leaving her
alone all this time?

00:03:05.623 --> 00:03:07.358
Hotaru has been living here by herself,

00:03:07.425 --> 00:03:09.727
asking strangers to pretend
to be her parents!

00:03:09.794 --> 00:03:12.263
-She's the one wh--
-I just didn’t contact him!

00:03:13.798 --> 00:03:16.567
Are you willing to take care
of Hotaru from now on?

00:03:17.168 --> 00:03:18.303
-Uh…
-Yes.

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:19.837
I think he will, right?

00:03:19.904 --> 00:03:21.806
Play along, or I’ll tell her you stole it.

00:03:24.175 --> 00:03:25.343
What will it be?

00:03:26.611 --> 00:03:28.413
I’ll take care of her.

00:03:29.414 --> 00:03:33.351
As her father,
I’ll properly look after Hotaru.

00:03:34.285 --> 00:03:36.020
Are you sure this is okay?

00:03:38.556 --> 00:03:41.826
Thank you so much for bringing him here.

00:03:44.062 --> 00:03:45.029
Okay.

00:03:47.198 --> 00:03:49.133
-That's great to hear.
-Yes!

00:03:49.967 --> 00:03:51.002
Yeah, good for her.

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:55.306
What?

00:03:55.873 --> 00:03:58.109
Did you two manage to make up?

00:03:58.876 --> 00:04:01.579
Ah! Well, yeah.

00:04:03.481 --> 00:04:05.883
I’ll consider the situation
resolved for now.

00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:08.286
From here on, please look after

00:04:08.353 --> 00:04:10.621
Hotaru as her neighbors.

00:04:11.155 --> 00:04:12.423
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:16.260
-I’m trusting you on this.
-Thank you.

00:04:16.327 --> 00:04:17.261
I'll excuse myself.

00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:26.237
-After looking closely, you're not my dad.
-Huh?

00:04:26.304 --> 00:04:27.839
Please give that back.

00:04:27.905 --> 00:04:29.574
-I don't wanna!
-Give it back!

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.242
I said no!

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:33.144
Then give me back my rabbit!

00:04:34.212 --> 00:04:35.546
Stop aiming for my lower body!

00:04:35.613 --> 00:04:37.248
-Stop--
-I'll be taking that from you.

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:38.850
Excuse me!

00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:41.652
-Yes?
-The 30 million…

00:04:42.186 --> 00:04:43.488
The money my mom embezzled.

00:04:43.554 --> 00:04:46.457
What happens if the total was returned
without any of it being used?

00:04:46.524 --> 00:04:48.493
-Do you have the 30 million with you?
-Oh, no.

00:04:49.193 --> 00:04:51.396
Just hypothetically speaking.

00:04:51.462 --> 00:04:54.031
I’m not sure of the exact verdict,

00:04:54.098 --> 00:04:55.600
but chances of a lighter sentence

00:04:55.666 --> 00:04:58.403
or a reprieve would likely increase,
I believe.

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:59.470
Is that right?

00:05:00.438 --> 00:05:02.440
You sure you don’t want me
to call the police?

00:05:02.507 --> 00:05:03.674
Yeah.

00:05:03.741 --> 00:05:06.411
I’m fine, really.
There's no need for the police.

00:05:07.078 --> 00:05:08.212
But your bag…

00:05:08.946 --> 00:05:10.982
There wasn’t anything important in it.

00:05:11.048 --> 00:05:12.450
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

00:05:13.184 --> 00:05:15.486
The person who stole them

00:05:15.553 --> 00:05:18.790
might be freaking out now
with all the keychains spilling out.

00:05:18.856 --> 00:05:21.359
If you're fine with that. Wait here, okay?

00:05:22.994 --> 00:05:23.828
DRAFT BEER

00:05:23.895 --> 00:05:25.196
Here's a little freebie!

00:05:25.263 --> 00:05:26.230
Thank you.

00:05:26.297 --> 00:05:27.532
Cheer up.

00:05:28.766 --> 00:05:30.034
My wallet was in my pocket.

00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:31.869
Then you can get home!

00:05:33.037 --> 00:05:34.138
Yes.

00:05:35.273 --> 00:05:38.042
I’m… going home.

00:05:42.647 --> 00:05:43.981
Oh, come on!

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.251
-Please give it back!
-It’s not your money!

00:05:47.318 --> 00:05:48.853
It’s not yours either!

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.621
-Give it back!
-Give it back?

00:05:50.688 --> 00:05:52.156
It’s embezzled cash!

00:05:52.223 --> 00:05:53.891
-What?
-I was safekeeping it!

00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.226
So, it’s mine for now!

00:05:55.293 --> 00:05:56.494
We guarded it together,

00:05:56.561 --> 00:05:57.795
so it’s mine too!

00:05:57.862 --> 00:05:59.864
That’s right! We’re in this together!

00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:00.865
Accomplice?

00:06:00.932 --> 00:06:02.133
Why are you so obsessed wi--

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.402
Because I can't bear to give them up!

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:06.737
A big car…

00:06:07.338 --> 00:06:08.739
with my wife and daughter…

00:06:08.806 --> 00:06:12.343
and my parents and a big dog…
Everyone together at the beach.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.845
And by doing this…

00:06:14.445 --> 00:06:16.781
Taking off my sunglasses and looking cool…

00:06:17.348 --> 00:06:19.884
That’s a man’s happiness!

00:06:23.588 --> 00:06:25.223
So, this time…

00:06:25.723 --> 00:06:26.858
I’m gonna do things right…

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:29.560
Oh, why are you here?

00:06:29.627 --> 00:06:31.929
Oh, um… I saw him

00:06:31.996 --> 00:06:33.965
running away with the suitcase

00:06:34.031 --> 00:06:36.934
and chased him but lost him,
so I came back here,

00:06:37.001 --> 00:06:38.469
and well, this is where I am.

00:06:38.536 --> 00:06:40.738
I see. Thanks.

00:06:40.805 --> 00:06:43.774
So, about this money…

00:06:43.841 --> 00:06:47.278
You were all hiding the embezzled cash
the entire time?

00:06:47.345 --> 00:06:48.613
Well, yeah.

00:06:49.547 --> 00:06:52.550
If we return it unused,
Mom might not get arrested.

00:06:53.851 --> 00:06:55.820
That police officer said so.

00:06:59.724 --> 00:07:01.025
Are you hungry?

00:07:02.093 --> 00:07:03.127
Huh?

00:07:03.194 --> 00:07:06.297
Do you have somewhere warm to sleep?

00:07:06.364 --> 00:07:09.433
Don't worry. You can stay here tonight.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.303
As if I'm gonna stay
in this rundown place!

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:13.771
Good luck sleeping on the streets then.

00:07:14.705 --> 00:07:15.540
What?

00:07:16.107 --> 00:07:17.775
Here.

00:07:17.842 --> 00:07:20.144
Eat up and have some hot tea.

00:07:21.812 --> 00:07:23.881
We still haven’t gotten
the money back though.

00:07:24.382 --> 00:07:26.117
He’s too cowardly

00:07:26.183 --> 00:07:27.385
to actually spend it.

00:07:27.985 --> 00:07:29.387
I sure hope that's the case.

00:07:29.453 --> 00:07:32.490
You’re not calling the police?

00:07:32.557 --> 00:07:35.660
-Hey!
-I won't call them, okay?

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.163
But… Wow.

00:07:40.731 --> 00:07:42.867
Pretending to be a parent is already bad,

00:07:42.934 --> 00:07:44.435
but hiding embezzled money too?

00:07:44.502 --> 00:07:46.437
You guys are absolutely insane.

00:07:46.504 --> 00:07:47.371
Sorry.

00:07:50.575 --> 00:07:54.078
I'm such a bore, aren't I?

00:07:54.145 --> 00:07:55.179
What?

00:07:55.246 --> 00:07:57.615
I don’t think I’m in the wrong here.

00:07:58.649 --> 00:08:00.184
But still, it’s boring, I guess?

00:08:01.152 --> 00:08:03.387
What's gotten into you? Are you alright?

00:08:03.454 --> 00:08:04.388
Yeah.

00:08:05.323 --> 00:08:07.058
Looking at animals helps.

00:08:07.725 --> 00:08:08.960
-Huh?
-When you’re down.

00:08:09.026 --> 00:08:11.062
I'm not exactly feeling down, though.

00:08:11.829 --> 00:08:12.730
Sorry.

00:08:16.267 --> 00:08:17.268
I'm taking my leave.

00:08:20.471 --> 00:08:22.506
Okay, that’s it for today.

00:08:22.573 --> 00:08:23.741
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:08:31.248 --> 00:08:34.051
Right after New Year’s, we have
the final parent teacher meeting.

00:08:34.118 --> 00:08:37.088
You’ll be making your final decisions
about your career paths,

00:08:37.154 --> 00:08:39.523
so make sure to discuss things
with your guardians.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:40.424
WRITTEN NOTICE

00:08:40.491 --> 00:08:43.661
With that said, I’ll hand out the notices.

00:08:51.669 --> 00:08:53.437
-What now.
-Want some?

00:08:54.772 --> 00:08:56.474
New Year’s soba?

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.942
It’s still early for that, no?

00:08:58.009 --> 00:08:59.510
If you don’t want it, that’s fine.

00:09:00.311 --> 00:09:02.446
-I’ll eat it.
-Here you go.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:07.785
Huh?

00:09:07.852 --> 00:09:10.121
What the hell is this? It's all in lumps.

00:09:10.187 --> 00:09:11.422
The landlady's handmade soba.

00:09:12.723 --> 00:09:14.125
It used to be her hobby.

00:09:14.725 --> 00:09:17.795
Camping was also her hobby,
so she has this tent.

00:09:18.396 --> 00:09:20.398
She didn’t stick with either though.

00:09:22.066 --> 00:09:24.001
Do you want the money that badly?

00:09:24.068 --> 00:09:24.935
Yeah.

00:09:25.002 --> 00:09:27.772
A man’s gotta have heaps of cash.

00:09:41.652 --> 00:09:42.653
What?

00:09:46.657 --> 00:09:48.659
NAKAYOSHI PLAZA

00:09:48.726 --> 00:09:49.794
Oh, welcome!

00:09:51.062 --> 00:09:53.097
Because you said I should look at animals.

00:09:53.164 --> 00:09:53.998
Ah, right.

00:09:54.799 --> 00:09:56.634
It's not that I’m not feeling low, okay!

00:09:57.401 --> 00:09:58.436
Got it.

00:09:58.502 --> 00:09:59.904
NAKAYOSHI PLAZA

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.173
Why does looking at animals help

00:10:02.239 --> 00:10:03.641
when I'm feeling low?

00:10:06.377 --> 00:10:08.412
Because they all live however they want.

00:10:08.479 --> 00:10:10.114
It’s encouraging.

00:10:10.181 --> 00:10:11.082
Really?

00:10:11.148 --> 00:10:13.117
Some run around,

00:10:13.184 --> 00:10:14.685
some stay still.

00:10:15.252 --> 00:10:16.787
Some stick together,

00:10:16.854 --> 00:10:18.289
some play alone.

00:10:18.856 --> 00:10:20.691
They are all different, but all cute.

00:10:21.425 --> 00:10:24.161
You kind of live
however you want too, Hatano.

00:10:24.228 --> 00:10:25.930
What, me?

00:10:25.996 --> 00:10:28.532
I wonder how you manage to do that.

00:10:29.767 --> 00:10:31.502
Is there something you want to do?

00:10:32.369 --> 00:10:34.071
I don’t know.

00:10:38.375 --> 00:10:39.877
Maybe observe really closely?

00:10:39.944 --> 00:10:42.279
Our landlady said that

00:10:42.346 --> 00:10:45.750
when she draws, if she really observes,
she starts noticing all sorts of things.

00:10:46.784 --> 00:10:50.054
So, maybe you should
really observe yourself?

00:10:50.621 --> 00:10:51.789
And I mean with your eyes.

00:10:52.356 --> 00:10:54.792
Really observe, with your very own eyes.

00:10:56.794 --> 00:10:57.628
Well then.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.568
ANIMALS ILLUSTRATION CONTEST

00:11:04.635 --> 00:11:06.837
It’s a joint contest
run by all zoos in Tokyo.

00:11:06.904 --> 00:11:08.706
When I gave this to the landlady earlier,

00:11:08.773 --> 00:11:11.108
she said she’s aiming for the grand prize!

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:13.611
Done.

00:11:14.812 --> 00:11:16.914
Should I be going
to the parent-teacher meeting?

00:11:16.981 --> 00:11:18.849
The contract lasts until graduation.

00:11:18.916 --> 00:11:19.984
Well, that's true.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:22.720
What about your career plans?
Have you decided on what exactly?

00:11:23.687 --> 00:11:26.257
-Well…
-Come on now…

00:11:27.691 --> 00:11:29.727
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

00:11:29.794 --> 00:11:31.162
I'm back.

00:11:32.663 --> 00:11:36.033
-Is that osechi?
-Yeah, I pre-ordered it.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.069
But more importantly, something
even more exciting is coming, right?

00:11:39.136 --> 00:11:40.938
Don't get ahead of yourself.

00:11:41.972 --> 00:11:42.840
About your house?

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.609
After New Year's,
we’re going to the property agency.

00:11:46.177 --> 00:11:48.045
Have you decided on the type of house?

00:11:48.112 --> 00:11:50.314
One that proves our love has meaning.

00:11:50.381 --> 00:11:51.849
We want that kind of house.

00:11:52.349 --> 00:11:54.151
One that will serve as a "clamp."

00:11:54.852 --> 00:11:56.020
A house of "love and revolution."

00:11:56.587 --> 00:11:58.155
What kind of house is that?

00:11:58.222 --> 00:12:00.357
Somewhere in Tokyo, around this area,

00:12:00.424 --> 00:12:02.293
under 55 million yen,

00:12:02.359 --> 00:12:04.261
a home we can live long-term,
that retains its value,

00:12:04.328 --> 00:12:05.996
is no more than ten years old,

00:12:06.063 --> 00:12:07.965
at least 50 square meters,

00:12:08.032 --> 00:12:10.000
has proper privacy,

00:12:10.067 --> 00:12:12.036
and a neighborhood
we can get along with well.

00:12:12.603 --> 00:12:13.938
That’s specific.

00:12:14.438 --> 00:12:18.409
INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS

00:12:24.982 --> 00:12:27.151
It’s time for the harvest.

00:12:28.385 --> 00:12:29.486
Here we go.

00:12:31.522 --> 00:12:32.556
Amazing!

00:12:33.724 --> 00:12:34.825
So, that's…

00:12:36.227 --> 00:12:38.596
the happiness a man
is unable to give up on?

00:12:38.662 --> 00:12:39.830
Why do you care?

00:12:39.897 --> 00:12:41.465
It’s cold outside, right?

00:12:41.532 --> 00:12:43.534
You can use a room if you want.

00:12:44.034 --> 00:12:46.270
After the New Year,
I’ll find a place and move out.

00:12:46.337 --> 00:12:48.606
Here, a homemade New Year’s osechi
from the landlady.

00:12:53.377 --> 00:12:54.378
GREAT LUCK

00:12:54.445 --> 00:12:55.646
Happy New Year.

00:12:55.713 --> 00:12:58.749
-Usami. Wanna eat?
-You named it Usami?

00:12:58.816 --> 00:13:00.618
What do you guys call it then?

00:13:01.585 --> 00:13:03.254
I haven’t thought about it.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.288
What about Usamaru?

00:13:04.355 --> 00:13:06.023
-Usamaru?
-Usamaru?

00:13:07.625 --> 00:13:09.093
Alone…

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.495
but not lonely!

00:13:11.562 --> 00:13:13.163
GOAL THIS YEAR: ALONE, BUT NOT LONELY!

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:14.331
I can do it.

00:13:18.435 --> 00:13:20.237
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year.

00:13:36.186 --> 00:13:40.524
-The prize money is 300,000 yen?
-Yeah, and I want this.

00:13:41.725 --> 00:13:42.726
That's cool.

00:13:43.294 --> 00:13:44.228
What are you gonna draw?

00:13:46.397 --> 00:13:48.399
-An animal, duh.
-What kind?

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.568
Are there animals around here?

00:13:53.337 --> 00:13:54.738
Animals, huh.

00:14:02.813 --> 00:14:03.948
I see how it is.

00:14:07.084 --> 00:14:10.154
Observe closely, huh?

00:14:15.225 --> 00:14:17.061
As for one that meets all your conditions,

00:14:17.127 --> 00:14:18.796
we don’t quite have it right now.

00:14:18.862 --> 00:14:20.698
You only have one job!

00:14:20.764 --> 00:14:21.899
Well…

00:14:22.967 --> 00:14:26.470
If you don’t mind paying a bit more…

00:14:26.537 --> 00:14:27.371
I do mind.

00:14:27.438 --> 00:14:29.173
Or a smaller place?

00:14:29.239 --> 00:14:31.008
I said no!

00:14:33.143 --> 00:14:34.378
Welcome!

00:14:34.445 --> 00:14:36.013
We’ve been expecting you.

00:14:36.714 --> 00:14:37.715
Please have a seat.

00:14:40.384 --> 00:14:41.618
What's with that look?

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.723
Please come by again
with updated conditions.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:48.125
-Sorry for the inconvenience.
-Geez.

00:14:49.193 --> 00:14:50.928
Alright. So…

00:14:51.462 --> 00:14:54.698
I found a few promising properties.

00:14:54.765 --> 00:14:57.167
If you like any,
we can schedule a viewing.

00:14:57.234 --> 00:14:58.235
-Okay!
-Please do.

00:14:58.302 --> 00:14:59.236
Great.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.839
First, this one.

00:15:01.905 --> 00:15:02.773
48 MILLION YEN

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.275
Within your budget, 48 million.

00:15:05.342 --> 00:15:07.411
Fifty square meters and 2LDK.

00:15:07.478 --> 00:15:09.913
Built 55 years ago,
but it's refurbished inside.

00:15:10.881 --> 00:15:12.750
A vintage house?

00:15:13.283 --> 00:15:16.286
I was hoping for something
that could hold its value, you know?

00:15:17.054 --> 00:15:19.957
If you want to prioritize asset value…

00:15:20.691 --> 00:15:22.192
Here’s another option.

00:15:22.259 --> 00:15:24.495
Sixty square meters,
two minutes from the station,

00:15:24.561 --> 00:15:26.663
and only ten years old.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:27.931
Seventy million, though…

00:15:28.499 --> 00:15:31.268
For both of you, the monthly repayment

00:15:31.335 --> 00:15:34.438
would be around 200,000 yen.

00:15:34.505 --> 00:15:36.006
Manageable if you budget carefully.

00:15:36.073 --> 00:15:38.275
Sounds good. You two
could handle a modest life.

00:15:38.342 --> 00:15:40.911
But life would get pretty tight then, no?

00:15:42.246 --> 00:15:43.547
If we want to prioritize budget?

00:15:44.548 --> 00:15:46.050
This is a 20-year-old house.

00:15:46.116 --> 00:15:48.018
Forty-four point eight million.

00:15:48.585 --> 00:15:51.288
-Where is this?
-Saitama prefecture.

00:15:52.456 --> 00:15:54.958
It’s going to take a while
to get to work then.

00:15:55.025 --> 00:15:57.261
Just commuting alone will wear you out.

00:15:58.028 --> 00:16:00.164
And it’s 20 years old, huh?

00:16:01.899 --> 00:16:04.802
Sorry, I forgot to ask.

00:16:04.868 --> 00:16:06.837
What are your priorities?

00:16:06.904 --> 00:16:08.705
Longevity? Investment value?

00:16:08.772 --> 00:16:10.674
Size? Privacy?

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.514
Since we’re buying a house,

00:16:17.581 --> 00:16:19.583
I want a good one
that meets our conditions.

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:22.853
Same here. I don’t want
to compromise too much.

00:16:25.789 --> 00:16:27.124
Well then, could you all

00:16:27.191 --> 00:16:29.093
come with me for a moment?

00:16:31.962 --> 00:16:34.865
-Um, how much longer--
-Please don’t move!

00:16:34.932 --> 00:16:35.833
Sorry.

00:16:36.834 --> 00:16:39.136
-Hello!
-Hello.

00:16:39.203 --> 00:16:40.637
-Hello.
-Huh?

00:16:40.704 --> 00:16:41.872
Hello.

00:16:42.473 --> 00:16:44.608
-Who are you?
-Our model.

00:16:44.675 --> 00:16:46.443
-What model?
-This.

00:16:47.511 --> 00:16:49.847
She just happened to be passing by.

00:16:49.913 --> 00:16:51.815
-Sorry about this.
-Ah, it’s fine.

00:16:51.882 --> 00:16:54.518
I just came on my lunch break
to buy some roasted sweet potatoes

00:16:54.585 --> 00:16:55.519
and I got scouted.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.554
I scouted her.

00:16:57.621 --> 00:17:00.357
Wait, are you even supposed
to draw humans?

00:17:00.424 --> 00:17:01.291
ANIMALS ILLUSTRATION CONTEST

00:17:01.358 --> 00:17:03.594
Are you a school teacher?

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:04.728
Are they your students?

00:17:04.795 --> 00:17:07.064
I’m with Nikomado
from the Niko Consultation Desk.

00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:09.433
My name is Koito.

00:17:09.967 --> 00:17:12.236
We’re all from different schools.

00:17:12.302 --> 00:17:13.804
This is the only place we meet.

00:17:13.871 --> 00:17:15.172
But we’re really good friends.

00:17:15.239 --> 00:17:17.374
You too, Koinobori. Don't you agree?

00:17:17.441 --> 00:17:19.143
We're friends?

00:17:19.209 --> 00:17:20.277
Are we not?

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.580
You're not wrong.

00:17:25.516 --> 00:17:26.717
Are you guys keeping up?

00:17:26.783 --> 00:17:29.253
Is there a nice property
up ahead or something?

00:17:29.319 --> 00:17:30.854
-Are we there yet?
-Hey!

00:17:30.921 --> 00:17:33.090
-You've got to be picking on us, no?
-Sorry.

00:17:33.157 --> 00:17:34.158
We're almost there.

00:17:36.193 --> 00:17:37.461
Nice view!

00:17:37.961 --> 00:17:39.530
You're right.

00:17:39.596 --> 00:17:42.199
I like it here. Sometimes
I come up to take a breather.

00:17:43.467 --> 00:17:46.637
See that brown apartment
along the main street?

00:17:46.703 --> 00:17:48.038
-The huge one?
-Right.

00:17:49.072 --> 00:17:51.942
The people living there
stretched their finances

00:17:52.009 --> 00:17:53.443
to buy a condo over their budget.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:54.411
But

00:17:54.478 --> 00:17:56.647
the side job they started
to make ends meet

00:17:56.713 --> 00:17:58.715
ended up doing better than their main job.

00:17:58.782 --> 00:17:59.783
Really?

00:18:00.417 --> 00:18:03.754
And that house
with the orange roof over there.

00:18:04.321 --> 00:18:05.522
It's near a park,

00:18:05.589 --> 00:18:07.224
so bugs sometimes get into the rooms,

00:18:07.291 --> 00:18:09.059
but in autumn, you can hear the crickets,

00:18:09.126 --> 00:18:11.295
and they enjoy the seasonal charm.

00:18:12.496 --> 00:18:14.731
That condo over there has thin walls,

00:18:14.798 --> 00:18:16.567
but they say it makes them
feel less alone,

00:18:16.633 --> 00:18:19.303
so they can binge horror movies
even when alone.

00:18:20.737 --> 00:18:22.105
Okay?

00:18:22.172 --> 00:18:23.574
So, why drag us all the way here?

00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:26.944
Because… Listen,

00:18:28.078 --> 00:18:29.413
I get wanting ideal conditions

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.482
and not wanting to compromise.

00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:35.319
But giving something up…

00:18:36.019 --> 00:18:39.456
isn’t always a bad thing.

00:18:39.523 --> 00:18:41.024
That's what I wanted to convey.

00:18:44.027 --> 00:18:45.229
It's the same with our place.

00:18:45.963 --> 00:18:48.332
It’s pretty old,
and honestly, it’s falling apart.

00:18:48.398 --> 00:18:49.600
The rooms are cramped,

00:18:50.267 --> 00:18:52.603
the washing machine is outside,
and the stairs break too.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:55.005
Don’t roast that place too hard.

00:18:55.973 --> 00:18:58.542
But we get to live with animals,

00:18:58.609 --> 00:18:59.476
the landlady is funny,

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.945
and I met Hotaru there.

00:19:02.946 --> 00:19:04.381
And Sakuta.

00:19:04.448 --> 00:19:06.083
Is that our place?

00:19:06.617 --> 00:19:07.618
What?

00:19:08.285 --> 00:19:10.587
Isn't that the complete
opposite direction?

00:19:10.654 --> 00:19:12.856
Nah, it’s this way. I'm sure of it.

00:19:13.857 --> 00:19:15.726
Okay, done!

00:19:30.907 --> 00:19:32.342
I forgot the ring.

00:19:39.149 --> 00:19:40.017
I see now…

00:19:42.185 --> 00:19:45.022
I wanted to take it off all along.

00:19:46.323 --> 00:19:48.825
BODYWORK & PAINT

00:19:55.632 --> 00:19:57.200
250,400 YEN

00:20:00.337 --> 00:20:02.406
Thank you, miss!

00:20:02.472 --> 00:20:04.675
-Thanks!
-Thanks!

00:20:04.741 --> 00:20:05.876
Don’t mention it.

00:20:06.443 --> 00:20:07.477
Get home safe!

00:20:07.544 --> 00:20:08.879
-Okay!
-Bye!

00:20:08.945 --> 00:20:10.147
How awesome are we?

00:20:10.213 --> 00:20:12.249
It was fun being a model for them.

00:20:14.117 --> 00:20:17.421
They’re all pretty much alone
at school and at home.

00:20:18.288 --> 00:20:20.090
But here, they’re not alone.

00:20:22.059 --> 00:20:25.462
So, it’s hard telling them not to come
to a place like this.

00:20:29.166 --> 00:20:31.335
This… It’s gotten a little cold,
but if you'd like…

00:20:32.469 --> 00:20:33.637
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

00:20:33.704 --> 00:20:35.105
Just a little something to share.

00:20:42.245 --> 00:20:43.347
Welcome back.

00:20:44.114 --> 00:20:45.482
I'm back.

00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:47.084
There, a little something for you.

00:20:51.621 --> 00:20:53.123
-Is that a seagull?
-What?

00:20:54.224 --> 00:20:55.592
You could tell?

00:20:56.593 --> 00:20:57.928
What kind of seagull is that?

00:20:58.528 --> 00:21:00.664
There are 50 species
of seagulls in the world.

00:21:01.198 --> 00:21:02.866
What, that many?

00:21:02.933 --> 00:21:04.468
You don't even know that?

00:21:04.534 --> 00:21:05.869
Hell, why do you even know that?

00:21:06.536 --> 00:21:08.972
Seagulls are a man’s dream.

00:21:10.273 --> 00:21:12.175
That's gotta be Jin Ichigaya's dream.

00:21:12.976 --> 00:21:16.446
I mean, I’ve never heard anyone
say seagulls are a man’s dream.

00:21:16.513 --> 00:21:18.882
Jin Ichigaya’s dream?
What’s that even supposed to mean?

00:21:21.017 --> 00:21:23.787
Hey, sit over there for a sec.

00:21:24.287 --> 00:21:26.022
What, why?

00:21:27.624 --> 00:21:28.825
What's this about?

00:21:33.363 --> 00:21:34.364
Come on…

00:21:38.769 --> 00:21:40.637
SHAPING THE SOUNDS OF THE FUTURE

00:21:48.845 --> 00:21:51.181
NO EXPERIENCE NEEDED! CRAFTSMEN WANTED

00:21:52.816 --> 00:21:54.117
CONTACT INFORMATION

00:21:54.184 --> 00:21:55.352
ADDRESS: NAGANO PREFECTURE

00:22:02.659 --> 00:22:04.461
Alright, let’s make this nice and clean.

00:22:07.831 --> 00:22:09.199
How’s the new home?

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.169
Are you glad this is your home?

00:22:14.404 --> 00:22:16.273
What even is a home?

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.675
I don't even know anymore.

00:22:20.844 --> 00:22:22.145
What do you think?

00:22:22.913 --> 00:22:24.147
-What?
-Huh?

00:22:28.285 --> 00:22:29.586
Who's that?

00:22:29.653 --> 00:22:31.688
Who knows? At my age,

00:22:31.755 --> 00:22:33.123
I’ve seen it all already.

00:22:34.758 --> 00:22:37.027
Um, what are you doing here?

00:22:37.093 --> 00:22:39.162
CURRENTLY CROWDFUNDING!

00:22:39.229 --> 00:22:40.564
I couldn’t go home.

00:22:42.299 --> 00:22:43.300
In the end…

00:22:44.434 --> 00:22:47.637
I didn’t manage to collect
all the keychains.

00:22:48.905 --> 00:22:51.942
I was chasing some silly dream,
thinking that if it came true,

00:22:52.776 --> 00:22:56.213
I could be Hotaru’s mom again.

00:22:57.948 --> 00:22:58.882
I…

00:22:58.949 --> 00:23:02.085
clung to that dream like an idiot,
and in the end…

00:23:02.953 --> 00:23:03.920
I failed.

00:23:05.555 --> 00:23:06.656
I'm still…

00:23:07.224 --> 00:23:09.459
a useless mom.

00:23:12.696 --> 00:23:13.663
Maybe…

00:23:14.331 --> 00:23:15.665
we might as well

00:23:15.732 --> 00:23:17.400
give it all up, together.

00:23:19.336 --> 00:23:20.403
What?

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:21.304
Right now,

00:23:21.371 --> 00:23:24.040
I’m trying to buy a house with my partner,

00:23:24.708 --> 00:23:27.043
but finding one that fits
all our conditions is tough.

00:23:29.646 --> 00:23:30.780
Just once.

00:23:30.847 --> 00:23:33.984
I was thinking maybe we should try
giving up in a positive way.

00:23:35.185 --> 00:23:36.553
Want to try it together?

00:23:37.087 --> 00:23:39.990
On three… two, one, together.

00:23:41.358 --> 00:23:44.294
Whether it's an ideal home
or an ideal mom…

00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:48.265
Let’s try giving up for real,
but in a positive way.

00:23:49.833 --> 00:23:51.234
How so?

00:23:52.135 --> 00:23:53.403
Then maybe

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:55.906
things will turn out better than expected.

00:23:59.609 --> 00:24:00.744
What do you say?

00:24:06.283 --> 00:24:07.117
Hotaru…

00:24:08.118 --> 00:24:09.452
She is waiting for you.

00:24:10.654 --> 00:24:12.188
Please come home to her.

00:24:21.064 --> 00:24:22.065
We'll be waiting.

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.242
Wow, it looks just like him.

00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:35.278
Even the worn-out look.

00:24:35.345 --> 00:24:37.514
It's like he hasn’t showered in days.

00:24:38.281 --> 00:24:39.516
It’s winter, so who cares?

00:24:39.583 --> 00:24:42.819
But it doesn’t really feel
quite like Jin Ichigaya's dream, you know?

00:24:45.855 --> 00:24:46.990
How about this?

00:24:51.795 --> 00:24:52.896
What about this?

00:24:56.967 --> 00:24:59.269
This has gotta be it, right?

00:25:03.573 --> 00:25:05.875
Why don't we add one more man catcher?

00:25:09.613 --> 00:25:10.547
Got it!

00:25:12.115 --> 00:25:12.949
What?

00:25:14.918 --> 00:25:16.286
Please forgive me!

00:25:16.853 --> 00:25:18.154
Why are you running away!

00:25:20.156 --> 00:25:21.057
Huh?

00:25:25.762 --> 00:25:27.797
-What is he doing?
-I wonder…

00:25:29.899 --> 00:25:30.900
Sorry!

00:25:31.568 --> 00:25:32.969
I'm sorry!

00:25:35.338 --> 00:25:36.840
I have a lot to say…

00:25:37.474 --> 00:25:40.276
but welcome back, I guess.

00:25:41.911 --> 00:25:42.846
Yes.

00:25:44.514 --> 00:25:45.949
-He's staring at it.
-Right.

00:25:46.449 --> 00:25:47.617
Yeah.

00:25:57.994 --> 00:26:00.263
Didn't I just welcome you back?

00:26:02.265 --> 00:26:04.334
-Welcome back!
-Welcome back!

00:26:06.503 --> 00:26:07.771
Welcome back.

00:26:12.709 --> 00:26:14.344
Remember our promise?

00:26:18.648 --> 00:26:20.216
Three, two, one…

00:26:25.655 --> 00:26:26.723
You're coming back home?

00:26:28.692 --> 00:26:29.526
Yes.

00:26:35.432 --> 00:26:36.933
Thank you for…

00:26:37.967 --> 00:26:38.868
taking care of Hotaru.

00:26:40.236 --> 00:26:41.404
It’s nothing.

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.442
I'm…

00:26:46.676 --> 00:26:48.044
really thankful.

00:26:49.112 --> 00:26:49.946
Don't mention it.

00:26:57.954 --> 00:26:58.988
Everyone…

00:27:01.725 --> 00:27:02.692
I’m really sorry for…

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:04.961
the inconvenience I caused.

00:27:11.334 --> 00:27:12.368
Welcome home.

00:27:18.308 --> 00:27:19.309
I'm back.

00:27:23.847 --> 00:27:24.948
Miso soup…

00:27:25.815 --> 00:27:27.317
There’s some left over from yesterday.

00:27:31.354 --> 00:27:32.222
I'll have it.

00:27:47.003 --> 00:27:48.404
Um, Sakuta.

00:27:50.039 --> 00:27:51.141
What is it?

00:27:52.809 --> 00:27:54.077
Can we talk for a moment?

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.048
-Let's eat.
-Thank you.

00:28:15.098 --> 00:28:15.932
It's good.

00:28:15.999 --> 00:28:18.334
I added in the secret ingredient.

00:28:19.936 --> 00:28:21.538
TRUE MIRIN

00:28:22.138 --> 00:28:23.940
I went shopping with Mr. Hatano.

00:28:24.874 --> 00:28:28.578
I didn’t know you had to be 20
to buy true mirin. I was surprised.

00:28:39.689 --> 00:28:41.858
I’m sorry…

00:28:49.365 --> 00:28:50.633
I'm really…

00:28:53.169 --> 00:28:54.103
sorry.

00:29:00.977 --> 00:29:02.178
In the end…

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.916
I couldn’t even collect all the keychains…

00:29:07.517 --> 00:29:08.351
Huh?

00:29:08.418 --> 00:29:10.320
My bag was stolen
and so were the keychains.

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:15.191
And now…

00:29:16.326 --> 00:29:18.061
I'm only left with just this.

00:29:18.127 --> 00:29:19.429
NARA

00:29:19.495 --> 00:29:20.830
I see.

00:29:22.332 --> 00:29:23.399
With Nagano,

00:29:24.234 --> 00:29:26.169
it would’ve been complete.

00:29:29.806 --> 00:29:31.074
I won’t forgive you.

00:29:32.242 --> 00:29:34.043
I love you, Mom,

00:29:34.811 --> 00:29:36.179
but embezzling,

00:29:36.913 --> 00:29:39.215
running away by yourself,
and never coming back?

00:29:40.116 --> 00:29:41.217
I won't forgive you for that.

00:29:43.052 --> 00:29:45.221
Just saying, "Have a good day"
every morning,

00:29:46.122 --> 00:29:49.225
drinking miso soup
while saying, "It's good,"

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:53.296
or chatting and laughing before bed
about how our day went.

00:29:56.466 --> 00:29:58.067
I’m happy…

00:29:59.869 --> 00:30:01.037
just with that.

00:30:07.777 --> 00:30:08.778
Sorry…

00:30:13.049 --> 00:30:13.983
I'm sorry.

00:30:17.987 --> 00:30:18.922
I really am…

00:30:27.363 --> 00:30:28.264
Mom…

00:30:31.668 --> 00:30:32.535
Your glasses…

00:30:33.202 --> 00:30:34.237
You had them, right?

00:30:50.887 --> 00:30:53.289
This will soak up all your tears.

00:30:53.356 --> 00:30:54.557
What is this?

00:30:59.862 --> 00:31:02.532
About the house…

00:31:03.499 --> 00:31:04.434
What about it?

00:31:05.234 --> 00:31:08.905
Maybe we should rethink it
from the beginning.

00:31:09.639 --> 00:31:10.974
Why?

00:31:13.443 --> 00:31:16.446
I realized that rather
than the house itself,

00:31:16.512 --> 00:31:19.382
how we live together matters more.

00:31:20.717 --> 00:31:23.019
Before we talk about
the house being a "clamp."

00:31:23.786 --> 00:31:25.588
Is that really coming from you, Hatano?

00:31:26.756 --> 00:31:30.526
Until now, I was so focused on buying
a house to keep us together.

00:31:31.127 --> 00:31:32.729
I had to use the house as a "clamp"…

00:31:32.795 --> 00:31:34.764
My head was full of thoughts like that.

00:31:35.431 --> 00:31:39.002
But I absolutely don’t want to break up.

00:31:39.068 --> 00:31:39.902
I won’t.

00:31:41.404 --> 00:31:42.538
Okay.

00:31:42.605 --> 00:31:47.977
We’ve already had plenty
of "clamps" in place anyway.

00:31:49.012 --> 00:31:50.413
Such as our partnership,

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.915
the memories we made together,

00:31:53.483 --> 00:31:55.785
this place, Inokashira Apartments,

00:31:59.088 --> 00:32:00.223
and Hotaru.

00:32:01.057 --> 00:32:02.158
Those things…

00:32:03.192 --> 00:32:04.560
already exist.

00:32:06.429 --> 00:32:07.363
I agree.

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:08.831
So, to feel at ease for once,

00:32:10.099 --> 00:32:11.868
in a positive way…

00:32:12.402 --> 00:32:13.736
I want to try giving things up.

00:32:16.806 --> 00:32:17.840
Thank you for the food.

00:32:19.275 --> 00:32:22.612
I’ve been thinking about that
for a while now…

00:32:27.183 --> 00:32:29.252
Mr. Hatano plays the guitar,

00:32:29.952 --> 00:32:31.754
and I came to like it
when I saw him do so.

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:35.091
So…

00:32:35.158 --> 00:32:36.959
I tried making one myself.

00:32:38.127 --> 00:32:39.195
You made this?

00:32:44.233 --> 00:32:45.368
You’re a genius.

00:32:47.336 --> 00:32:50.073
-You're exaggerating.
-No, really.

00:32:51.974 --> 00:32:53.543
This is a masterpiece!

00:32:54.844 --> 00:32:57.980
Are you going to give up
on the keychains, Mom?

00:33:01.784 --> 00:33:02.785
Okay.

00:33:06.923 --> 00:33:08.224
Yes?

00:33:10.993 --> 00:33:12.128
What do you want?

00:33:13.396 --> 00:33:16.532
Wait, why do you have that?

00:33:21.304 --> 00:33:22.205
Huh?

00:33:22.271 --> 00:33:26.309
If we just return it as is,
she won’t get arrested, right?

00:33:27.844 --> 00:33:29.812
-Are you fine with that?
-Yeah, I’m tired.

00:33:29.879 --> 00:33:31.180
I give up.

00:33:32.115 --> 00:33:35.051
The car, the money, being a dad, or a man…

00:33:35.551 --> 00:33:37.487
It’s all too much.

00:33:38.888 --> 00:33:41.157
Somehow, I feel so light!

00:33:42.792 --> 00:33:45.161
You didn’t use the money?

00:33:45.228 --> 00:33:46.462
Nah.

00:33:47.096 --> 00:33:47.964
Neither did I…

00:33:49.499 --> 00:33:50.900
or anyone else.

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:55.905
-Is that how it is?
-Well then.

00:33:58.207 --> 00:33:59.242
Wait, Dad!

00:34:00.209 --> 00:34:03.779
I meant, former dad.

00:34:05.548 --> 00:34:06.382
What is it?

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:09.418
You too, Mom.

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:11.821
I have…

00:34:12.588 --> 00:34:13.789
one last request.

00:34:14.857 --> 00:34:15.892
Good boy…

00:34:16.592 --> 00:34:19.162
This feels more like home after all,

00:34:19.228 --> 00:34:20.129
isn't that right?

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:24.233
-Um, maybe I shouldn’t be here after all.
-Please stay.

00:34:24.901 --> 00:34:25.968
Together with me.

00:34:27.103 --> 00:34:28.137
Okay.

00:34:29.238 --> 00:34:30.840
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:34:30.907 --> 00:34:32.074
-Take care on the way out.
-Yes.

00:34:36.345 --> 00:34:37.280
Next…

00:34:41.551 --> 00:34:42.451
What's going on?

00:34:43.319 --> 00:34:44.520
This is my mom,

00:34:45.788 --> 00:34:47.123
former dad,

00:34:48.591 --> 00:34:49.759
and my dad.

00:34:49.825 --> 00:34:50.993
You're not wrong, but…

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:52.128
They’re all my guardians.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:57.333
Okay then, before we get
to the main topic,

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.035
could you share your plans going forward?

00:34:59.635 --> 00:35:00.870
-Right.
-Yes.

00:35:00.937 --> 00:35:01.938
Uh-huh.

00:35:02.004 --> 00:35:03.573
YEAR 3 CLASS 4 PARENT-TEACHER MEETING

00:35:03.639 --> 00:35:06.642
Ma’am, what are your plans?

00:35:08.044 --> 00:35:11.080
For now, I’m thinking
of turning myself in.

00:35:11.147 --> 00:35:12.582
And after that?

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:16.552
I honestly have no idea what will happen.

00:35:16.619 --> 00:35:19.188
But I did come to realize one thing.

00:35:20.223 --> 00:35:21.824
-And what's that?
-Maybe

00:35:22.892 --> 00:35:26.162
I can live just fine,
even without a dream.

00:35:26.229 --> 00:35:27.863
Instead of chasing what I don’t have,

00:35:28.598 --> 00:35:31.267
if I can cherish what I already have,

00:35:32.168 --> 00:35:34.770
maybe that’s all I really need.

00:35:34.837 --> 00:35:36.439
What kind of logic is that?

00:35:37.006 --> 00:35:38.274
And what about you, sir?

00:35:38.908 --> 00:35:41.811
I’m quitting being a dad.

00:35:42.378 --> 00:35:44.513
You already did when we divorced.

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:46.015
You've never been a dad.

00:35:46.082 --> 00:35:47.116
Details don’t matter.

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:49.552
I've got no money, nothing.

00:35:50.419 --> 00:35:52.755
I’m done chasing a man’s dreams.

00:35:53.322 --> 00:35:55.391
From now on,
I’ll chase Jin Ichigaya’s dream.

00:35:56.225 --> 00:35:59.362
-Isn't that right?
-What do you even mean by that?

00:36:00.062 --> 00:36:01.597
I still don’t really get it…

00:36:02.198 --> 00:36:04.500
but, for starters, you know? That.

00:36:04.567 --> 00:36:06.035
-What?
-What do I need to do again?

00:36:06.102 --> 00:36:07.770
So that being alive feels good.

00:36:07.837 --> 00:36:10.840
Ah, doing things
like smiling and greeting.

00:36:12.241 --> 00:36:13.876
-Hello!
-Huh?

00:36:13.943 --> 00:36:14.944
Like that, right?

00:36:16.245 --> 00:36:17.813
-Hello!
-Hello!

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.582
-Hello!
-Hello!

00:36:19.649 --> 00:36:21.284
-Hello.
-Hello!

00:36:21.851 --> 00:36:22.885
You're doing great!

00:36:22.952 --> 00:36:23.953
Don't mess with me!

00:36:26.622 --> 00:36:28.924
Very well.

00:36:30.626 --> 00:36:32.128
And you, Mr. Hatano?

00:36:33.162 --> 00:36:35.231
Me? Uh, I…

00:36:36.032 --> 00:36:38.634
want to buy a house
with Mr. Sakuta, someday.

00:36:40.703 --> 00:36:42.938
Yeah, someday… Who knows when.

00:36:44.807 --> 00:36:47.643
So, he's Hatano’s partner?

00:36:48.511 --> 00:36:50.179
Yes, that's me.

00:36:50.246 --> 00:36:51.580
So that's how it is.

00:36:52.148 --> 00:36:54.183
We met thanks to Hotaru.

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:55.618
Really?

00:36:56.352 --> 00:36:59.121
Is that right?
Hotaru brought you two together.

00:37:01.857 --> 00:37:03.893
Well then, let’s get to the main topic.

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:07.296
It's about Hotaru’s career plans.

00:37:08.297 --> 00:37:09.465
Have you decided on something?

00:37:11.133 --> 00:37:12.368
I’m going to Nagano.

00:37:12.435 --> 00:37:13.636
-Huh?
-What?

00:37:13.703 --> 00:37:15.237
-Huh?
-Really?

00:37:15.304 --> 00:37:16.706
CRAFTSMEN WANTED

00:37:16.772 --> 00:37:18.574
I want to make guitars.

00:37:19.208 --> 00:37:20.476
I want to work here.

00:37:20.543 --> 00:37:22.111
So, you're not going to high school?

00:37:22.178 --> 00:37:23.446
I don't know.

00:37:23.946 --> 00:37:24.847
What do you mean?

00:37:24.914 --> 00:37:27.183
In any case, I want to try this out first.

00:37:27.917 --> 00:37:29.919
Even if I fail,
even if I end up on my own,

00:37:29.985 --> 00:37:32.688
I think I can actually manage somehow.

00:37:33.189 --> 00:37:34.757
Because even to a total stranger like me,

00:37:34.824 --> 00:37:37.693
there are adults who are kind,
who help you,

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.729
who understand how you feel,

00:37:39.795 --> 00:37:42.231
who care, I learned that.

00:37:43.833 --> 00:37:44.934
You know,

00:37:45.568 --> 00:37:47.403
all of you are completely
ridiculous adults.

00:37:51.474 --> 00:37:52.675
One committed embezzlement

00:37:52.742 --> 00:37:55.378
and left their kid alone
for some silly dream.

00:37:55.444 --> 00:37:56.712
And here she is now,

00:37:56.779 --> 00:37:59.682
claiming she can live
even without a dream.

00:37:59.749 --> 00:38:01.484
One ignored me for years

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:03.753
and only acts like a dad
when it's convenient,

00:38:03.819 --> 00:38:05.721
just for him to end up taking in a rabbit.

00:38:06.422 --> 00:38:08.624
There are also those who might get fired,

00:38:08.691 --> 00:38:10.092
might even get arrested,

00:38:10.593 --> 00:38:12.161
but still pretended to be my parent.

00:38:13.729 --> 00:38:16.732
I've come to learn that the world
has all kinds of weird adults.

00:38:19.468 --> 00:38:20.369
Because of that…

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:23.406
I feel like I can become anything,

00:38:24.573 --> 00:38:27.910
and I feel like I’ll be fine on my own.

00:38:30.613 --> 00:38:33.616
No matter what happens,
I feel like I can pull through.

00:38:36.218 --> 00:38:37.119
So…

00:38:38.621 --> 00:38:39.588
To everyone here,

00:38:40.756 --> 00:38:42.358
thank you very much.

00:38:46.595 --> 00:38:47.830
I…

00:38:49.632 --> 00:38:50.733
After graduating,

00:38:51.834 --> 00:38:53.636
I’m going to Nagano by myself.

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:56.272
Feels a bit lonely, doesn’t it?

00:38:56.939 --> 00:38:58.274
It's a bit early to say that.

00:39:00.843 --> 00:39:03.045
But good for Hotaru, huh?

00:39:04.547 --> 00:39:05.648
Yes.

00:39:05.714 --> 00:39:07.516
Good for her.

00:39:08.751 --> 00:39:11.320
We got called ridiculous adults, huh?

00:39:12.588 --> 00:39:15.624
-You seem happy about it.
-Yes.

00:39:17.293 --> 00:39:19.428
Just because I’m gay,

00:39:19.495 --> 00:39:20.930
I’ve been living timidly

00:39:20.996 --> 00:39:23.065
and held myself back.

00:39:24.066 --> 00:39:25.201
And now,

00:39:25.267 --> 00:39:28.137
getting called ridiculous?
Somehow, that makes me happy.

00:39:30.606 --> 00:39:31.440
In the past,

00:39:33.642 --> 00:39:35.377
I used to imagine

00:39:35.444 --> 00:39:37.580
what life would’ve been like

00:39:38.147 --> 00:39:39.915
if I weren’t gay.

00:39:42.151 --> 00:39:43.052
Sakuta,

00:39:43.118 --> 00:39:46.522
have you ever imagined what life
would be like if you weren’t gay?

00:39:48.624 --> 00:39:49.625
Well…

00:39:50.326 --> 00:39:52.261
Yeah, I have.

00:39:53.362 --> 00:39:54.396
And?

00:39:55.331 --> 00:39:57.833
I’m not telling.
Why are you asking all of a sudden?

00:40:00.669 --> 00:40:02.171
Well, I was just remembering

00:40:02.805 --> 00:40:05.541
something Hotaru asked me before.

00:40:06.775 --> 00:40:08.244
"Is being gay hard?"

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:09.845
"Are you glad you’re gay?"

00:40:10.713 --> 00:40:12.281
And what did you say?

00:40:13.482 --> 00:40:15.518
"I want to believe I am,"

00:40:15.584 --> 00:40:16.852
was what I said.

00:40:17.453 --> 00:40:18.354
Okay.

00:40:19.822 --> 00:40:21.524
And now…

00:40:22.391 --> 00:40:24.527
I think I really am glad.

00:40:25.995 --> 00:40:27.062
Me too.

00:40:27.997 --> 00:40:28.864
Glad to hear that.

00:40:31.133 --> 00:40:33.402
Yeah.

00:40:35.938 --> 00:40:37.273
How cute!

00:40:38.507 --> 00:40:39.508
Next.

00:40:40.075 --> 00:40:41.577
-Huh?
-What?

00:40:42.311 --> 00:40:43.479
A human?

00:40:43.546 --> 00:40:45.814
Seems like it, yeah.

00:40:46.448 --> 00:40:48.183
Humans indeed.

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:49.218
Another human.

00:40:49.285 --> 00:40:51.420
-The same human?
-Looks like it.

00:40:51.921 --> 00:40:53.122
But they aren't animals, right?

00:40:53.622 --> 00:40:55.357
Well, humans are living creatures, though.

00:40:56.258 --> 00:40:57.660
Okay then.

00:40:57.726 --> 00:40:59.161
Yeah.

00:41:00.896 --> 00:41:03.499
What, another human!

00:41:03.566 --> 00:41:05.834
This person seems happy about something.

00:41:05.901 --> 00:41:06.769
You're right.

00:41:07.903 --> 00:41:09.004
Something good must've happened.

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.975
Yet another human.

00:41:14.009 --> 00:41:16.312
-But there's a rabbit.
-Two…

00:41:16.879 --> 00:41:18.113
living creatures then.

00:41:31.427 --> 00:41:33.529
"I’m off to chase

00:41:33.596 --> 00:41:35.230
Jin Ichigaya’s dream."

00:41:38.167 --> 00:41:39.368
Make sure not to forget anything.

00:41:41.503 --> 00:41:43.672
Good luck with the police today.

00:41:44.406 --> 00:41:46.942
I might not be able to return for a while,

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:50.613
but I’ll cook meals
and put them in the fridge.

00:41:50.679 --> 00:41:52.114
See you.

00:41:52.181 --> 00:41:53.015
You too, Hotaru.

00:41:54.183 --> 00:41:55.117
See you.

00:41:55.718 --> 00:41:56.986
I’m off.

00:41:58.387 --> 00:42:00.155
Nagano is really far after all.

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:02.825
Will she be okay alone?

00:42:02.891 --> 00:42:04.560
Will she be eating proper meals?

00:42:05.194 --> 00:42:07.196
Will she skip school
or walk around late at night?

00:42:08.897 --> 00:42:12.301
Just thinking about it
makes my chest tight with worry.

00:42:12.368 --> 00:42:14.703
She's just there
to check things out today.

00:42:15.237 --> 00:42:16.271
You're right.

00:42:22.211 --> 00:42:24.780
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION FORM

00:42:24.847 --> 00:42:25.981
‎The food is ready.

00:42:27.149 --> 00:42:28.117
Coming.

00:42:28.651 --> 00:42:30.386
I’m ready!

00:42:30.452 --> 00:42:31.787
-I'll be off now.
-See you.

00:42:31.854 --> 00:42:32.721
-Bye!
-See you.

00:42:32.788 --> 00:42:33.622
-See you.
-Then,

00:42:33.689 --> 00:42:34.523
-I'm counting on you.
-Sure.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.195
-Matsumoto City, Nagano Prefecture…
-Okay.

00:42:40.829 --> 00:42:42.665
-Sasaga.
-Are you sure?

00:42:42.731 --> 00:42:44.900
-Yes.
-Take care.

00:45:03.505 --> 00:45:06.074
