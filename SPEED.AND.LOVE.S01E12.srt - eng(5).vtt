[Episode 12]

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.530
Tuesday, I love you in Thai.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.820
Didn't you ask me yesterday about someone

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.310
called Death?

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.750
I know who he is.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.010
Yesterday, I was playing basketball
in the neighborhood,

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.240
and some guys happened to

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.430
mention him.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.200
So, I specifically asked them about him.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.020
They said that Death was

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:31.740
a senior from a previous year.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.660
He was into racing,
had his own racing team,

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.450
and often participated in
illegal street races.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.100
The reason he's called "Death"

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.280
is because he was so fast

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.480
that anyone who raced him was doomed—

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.980
they lost before they even reached
the final lap.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.829
Too bad

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.820
his car was confiscated later,

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.930
so he quieted down.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.290
After that, no one knows what happened—

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.760
Death suddenly

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.320
disappeared a month or two
before the college entrance exam

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.980
and never came back to school.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.360
Shame, though—

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.820
he had pretty good grades.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.320
Quite legendary, right?

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.230
Why were you asking about him anyway?

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.320

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.630
"desert,"

"autumn,"

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.180
and "transportation."

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.530
Three stops.

I'm not that delicate.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.710
To be honest,

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.160
before meeting you, I never knew Jin Zhao

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.490
was into girls like you.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:28.070
You've known Jin Zhao for a long time?

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.190
When he first started working
at Wan's Garage,

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.650
I heard people talking about

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.510
a handsome new guy who had joined—

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:37.190
not only efficient
but also very capable too.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:38.940
The first time I met him

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.669
was at the garage's repair bay.

[WJAUTO]

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.090
That night, while driving back
from the bar,

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.970
I passed the garage

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.870
and saw the lights still on so late.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.310
So, I pulled over to check it out.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.100
I'd never seen an apprentice

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.810
as focused as he was.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:40.180
What's wrong with this car?

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:41.290
The valve is loose.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.970
Just needs to be tightened.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.680
What's your name?

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.250
Jin Zhao.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:54.680
I'm Wan Qing.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:02.080
Nice to meet you.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.850
Do you believe in love at first sight?

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.250
Maybe it was when he lifted his head
that I noticed

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.830
he not only had a great build
but also a handsome face.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:28.560
That was when I became interested in him.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.870
Sometimes, when I was out late,

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.780
I'd specifically swing by the garage

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.040
to have a smoke with him

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:34.790
or just do nothing—

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.390
sitting beside him, playing games,

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.590
or keeping him company while he worked.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:41.220
Honestly,

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.290
there were tons of mechanics his age

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.800
working for my dad.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.420
They came and went

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.210
like a revolving door.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.700
Few of them stayed put.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.390
They only worked
as much as they were paid for.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.640
But he was different.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.390
He was the only guy I'd ever seen

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:56.950
who always had a book in his hand.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:59.560
Others kept their lockers
full of cigarettes and alcohol,

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.960
but his was full of books.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.820
He'd already filled

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.650
more than two large notebooks.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.660
And his handwriting was beautiful.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:15.690
Come on, coffee for everyone!

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.240
Stop working. Take a break.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.770
What brings you here today?

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:21.590
This is my dad's garage.
I can come whenever I want.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:24.300
Come on, come on.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:25.340
Coffee, here you go.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.070
Jin Zhao.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.330
I heard you don't like sweet stuff.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:29.530
This one has no sugar.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.760
Thanks.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.020
Your handwriting is so beautiful.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.320
Mine is terrible.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.740
Could you teach me sometime?

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.480
I don't have time.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:24.810
Later, I heard from Crazy Jin

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.690
that Jin Zhao had a little sister at home.

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:29.410
She had congenital heart disease

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.070
and needed surgery urgently.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:33.490
But his family

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.900
couldn't afford such expensive surgery.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.570
It was Jin Zhao

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.830
who scraped together the money himself.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.080
At that time, many mechanics at the garage

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.020
would privately contact car owners

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.450
to buy cheap used cars,

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.300
fix them up, and resell them.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:53.190
They could make 10,000 to 20,000 yuan
on one flip,

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.110
sometimes even more.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.210
Jin Zhao saw this as an opportunity
to make money

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.180
and borrowed some money from Crazy Jin.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.420
He then bought a cheap car.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.450
A buyer told him that

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:06.860
if he could boost
the car's 0-100 km/h acceleration

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.660
and other performance aspects,

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:10.530
he would pay more.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.620
Jin Zhao started researching on his own.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.110
He drew diagrams, modified parts,

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.260
and pulled several all-nighters.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.610
He upgraded... what's it called...

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:23.970
the transmission system

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.100
and the powertrain.

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:30.690
The buyer was very satisfied

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:32.140
and paid him a large sum.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.480
Jin Zhao used this money

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.740
to pay for his sister's surgery.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.300
Here, count it.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.390
Then what happened?

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:43.780
Then...

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.040
Jin Zhao told Crazy Jin he wanted to quit;

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:47.990
he was done.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.260
The college entrance exam was
coming up then.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.520
He probably wanted to focus on studying.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.930
I heard his grades were really good,

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:56.860
though I don't know if that's true.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:06.970
It's true.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:11.360
Since childhood...

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:14.300
he was always by my side.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.260
When we were little...

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.660
he was always my role model.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.660
He could build very complex devices

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.090
on his own when he was in his early teens.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:27.530
Really.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.000
I've seen him excel in so many ways.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:34.470
Back then, he

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:35.890
wasn't like he is now.

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.220
He had a bit of a scholarly air about him,

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.380
quite attractive.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.090
When he said he quit, he meant it.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.200
I even cried over it once.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.300
I thought I'd never see him again.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:50.990
Jin Zhao...

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.380
didn't take the college entrance exam.

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:57.410
That's right.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.140
Did

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.570
something happen to him?

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.320
Something happened with the car.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.180
While the owner was driving,

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:14.920
the car lost control.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:15.890
He survived

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:17.850
but lost one leg.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.210
The subsequent investigation determined

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.130
that the car lost control
due to illegal modifications.

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:25.380
As the investigation progressed,

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:26.940
it led to Jin Zhao.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:28.900
The victim's family believed

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.810
that his aftermarket modifications
and sales

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:32.140
created safety hazards

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.890
that led to this negligent accident.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:35.140
They wanted to sue him.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:36.810
Crazy Jin was desperate at that time.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:38.980
He borrowed money from everyone

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:40.710
to pay compensation

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:42.900
and begged them not to sue Jin Zhao.

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:44.210
If Jin Zhao had a criminal record,

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:45.570
his life would be ruined.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.090
I was worried too.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.490
I quickly sold my newly bought sports car

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.210
and gave all the money to Crazy Jin,

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:52.780
hoping to help somehow.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:58.250
But...

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:01.780
Jin Zhao told Crazy Jin

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.620
he wouldn't accept my money.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.220
Maybe he didn't think much of me.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.670
Jin Zhao said he didn't want it.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.710
Did you tell him

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:18.060
this money came from selling my car

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.190
and had nothing to do with my dad?

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:20.260
I told him everything.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.120
He said, "Thanks, but no thanks."

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.520
Take it back quickly.
I've got things to do.

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:27.980
Take it back quickly, Miss.

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:29.520
I've got to get back to work.

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:44.020
What happened next?

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.610
Later, one of Jin Zhao's friends—

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:47.670
a guy named Sanlai who usually seemed

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.080
quite unreliable—

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.790
sold off his fast-food restaurant,

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.330
and they finally raised enough money.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.590
Only then did the victim agree to settle.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:58.380
After that incident...

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.090
he didn't go back to school

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:03.050
but went back to Wan's Garage

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.579
to work as an apprentice.

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:08.829
He did the dirtiest
and most exhausting work every day,

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.180
with no fixed start

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.770
or end time,

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:14.490
working nonstop like a machine.

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:16.490
It was as if he was using this as a way

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:18.420
to punish himself for his mistake.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.560
Zhang,

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.590
the car is fixed. Please check it.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.280
But later, as he gained more experience,

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.140
my dad valued him highly

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.720
and put him in charge of the garage.

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:56.190
That was when he discovered

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:59.010
that those old-timers were

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.740
hoarding tons of used parts.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.140
Some of the bolder ones

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:03.820
would swap out new parts

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.210
for substandard parts

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:07.090
or parts that car owners no longer wanted—

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:08.530
taking the new parts from clients' cars

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:09.820
and selling them.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.590
All just for some drinking money.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:16.590
Jin Zhao...

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:21.050
He was framed, right?

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.290
Yes.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:26.980
Someone tampered with the car.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:30.860
You know what?

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.710
For a long time before delivery,

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.590
that car was kept at Wan's Garage.

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:38.420
But it wasn't the garage's car.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:39.770
It wasn't even

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:41.500
a client's car from the garage.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.770
Even if it were a client's car,

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.420
those people would have still
messed with it—

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:48.100
let alone a car that Jin Zhao brought in

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.630
with absolutely no connection
to the garage?

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:53.260
That incident back then

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:54.380
was Wan Dayong's fault.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.350
He tampered with the car's sensors

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.000
and actuator components.

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.470
Mr. Wan approached all of us privately

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:02.140
and told us not to say a word about it.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.210
He asked us to keep

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:04.610
this matter buried.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:06.530
Sacrificing him

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.370
was the only way
to save the garage's business.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.430
That poor kid took the blame

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:13.100
and even believed it was his own fault.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.690
We had no choice back then.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.460
We all needed to make money for our families

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:17.790
and couldn't afford to lose our jobs.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.120
You understand, right?

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:28.440
After that day,

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:32.090
Jin Zhao left Wan's Garage,
where he had worked for three years,

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:33.220
and never came back.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.560
When it comes down to it...

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.010
it was Wan's Garage that wronged him.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.620
So Jin Zhao endured

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.080
all this injustice alone,

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.210
and I knew nothing about it.

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:52.690
It's all my fault.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:56.770

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.140
This bottle...

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:21.530
Here you go.

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:24.620
I'll have this one.

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:25.530
Alright, stop drinking.

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:26.580
You've had too much.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:31.100
Give it back to me! I want to drink!
I want to drink!

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.520
Let me open it for you.

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:37.490
Fine, I'll drink with you.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.350
Then let's toast.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:47.150
Cheers!

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:02.250
[Speeding Auto House]

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:33.660
Here. Have some honey water.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:53.590
Feeling better?

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:04.780
What happened to your leg?

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:09.210
Who did this?

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:10.400
Wan Qing?

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:12.570
It wasn't her.

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:19.290
I accidentally
bumped into something myself.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.640
Do you like her?

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.790
Who?

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:43.250
Wan Qing.

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:45.300
I don't care.

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:49.290
No matter how nice she's been to you,

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.720
you can't like her.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.300
Have you sobered up?

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.020
Saying stuff like that to me.

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:15.470
It's getting late.

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:18.430
Let me help you to bed.

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.900
I...

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:38.430
I'm all grown up now.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Jiang Mu, you...

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:15.390
When did you...

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.780
Why are you out here
in the middle of the night, moon-gazing?

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:53.180
Are you crazy?
You scared the hell out of me!

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:00.430
Someone was just here?

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:02.340
Yeah.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.150
Just finished chatting with them.

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:04.760
Who?

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.670
Your little fangirl, Wan Qing.

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:11.180
Wasn't she drunk?

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:12.450
Yeah.

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:15.290
She was wasted and forced He Zhang

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:16.330
to bring her over here.

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.010
She even tried to break into your garage.

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:20.050
I just saw you
carrying Jiang Mu back inside,

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:22.100
so I couldn't let her
ruin your moment, right?

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:23.690
Well, lucky you.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.020
She grabbed me, crying and making a scene.

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:28.350
She told me all about her feelings
for you—

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:29.500
her secret crush,

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:30.510
obvious affection,

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:31.910
and her unrequited love.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.560
She went through the whole story with me.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:39.660
Oh, right.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.520
Wan Qing just told me that

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.250
when they were drinking, she told Jiang Mu

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:46.340
all about the old grudges

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.000
between you and Wan's Garage.

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:50.980
Jiang Mu wasn't upset, was she?

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.290
Zhao.

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:56.530
I'm back.

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:00.450
I'll never leave you again.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:07.810
No.

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:30.760
Brandy.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.500
Jiang Mu is actually a pretty nice girl.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.760
Look at her—

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:41.540
she's tall,

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.010
fair-skinned,

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:45.550
with long, straight black hair.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.600
And she has a great personality.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.530
Sure, she can be
a little dramatic sometimes,

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:52.090
but she's smart

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:53.820
and quick to learn.

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:56.380
Her only flaw is

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:58.030
that she's a picky eater.

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:00.210
But being picky means
she won't gain weight,

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:01.270
so that's good too.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.480
You know what?

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.880
Just imagine if Jiang Mu got chubby—

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:07.940
all plump and fair,

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.420
with two ponytails—

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:13.180
she'd be so adorable.

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:17.950
Did she pay you to say all that?

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.880
Why are you praising her so much?

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:21.050
What are you talking about?

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:22.660
I'm just telling the truth.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:29.470
Or do you think I'm wrong about something?

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:32.870
No. It's all true.

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:38.360
What do you think of her?

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:39.980
Pretty good.

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:44.620
What about as your girlfriend?

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:50.280
I've never thought about that.

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:54.750
Well, think about it now.

00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:59.650
Why should I think about that now?

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:00.860
You're not doing anything anyway.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:02.320
Just give it some thought.

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:07.840
But I really...

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:10.320
I really shouldn't think about it.

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:25.650
Brandy, oh, Brandy.

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:29.010
In this lifetime,

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.860
if any girl ever gets into your heart...

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:35.890
that girl...

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:41.100
can only be Jiang Mu.

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.020
She doesn't need to try to get in.

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.380
She's always been there.

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:34.430
What's wrong?

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:36.750
Why did you drink so much?

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:41.860
Because...

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:49.920
I like you.

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.850
I like you.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.330
I like you.

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.260
I really like you.

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.380
I've liked you for so long.

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:09.040
Why don't you like me back?

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:12.630
Act...

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:14.040
Actually...

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:15.180
-Actually, I…
-Really.

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.730
I like you, Jin Zhao.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.010
I like you.

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.310
I like you.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.490
Jin Zhao said he didn't want it.

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:07.940
Take it back quickly, Miss.

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.469
I've got to get back to work.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.860
This year, we won't put as much

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.719
in the red envelopes for the kids.

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:40.570
Put that down.

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.400
Put it down.

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.190
You dare covet this? Are you crazy?

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:52.969
No drinking!

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.030
You have to drive tomorrow!

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:57.250
How can I sleep if I don't drink?

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:59.200
And how can I drive if I don't sleep well?

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.600
Anyway, you're not allowed to drink today!

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.550
Put it back.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.520
Do I have to yell at you
for you to listen?

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:28.730
Is it really appropriate for us
to just leave like this?

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:30.490
Leaving Mu alone here?

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:32.820
Why don't we take her with us?

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:33.750
The whole family

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:34.780
can enjoy a lively

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.980
and cheerful New Year together.
Wouldn't that be nice?

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.190
She won't go with us.

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.730
Did you even ask her? What if she would?

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:44.910
Zhao is busy at the garage.

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:46.380
It's New Year,
and she'll be all alone here.

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:47.420
How lonely that must be.

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.020
If you don't believe me, let's make a bet.

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.700
If I win, you'll let me drink...

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:51.780
You... You...

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:53.460
You asked for it.

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:54.970
You idiot.

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:58.470
Betting on our child?
You've really lost it.

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:00.110
You've lost your mind.

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:03.540
Anyway,

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:04.690
no matter what,

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:07.340
I'm giving Mu a big red envelope.

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.080
She's spending the New Year here.

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:12.370
We absolutely cannot treat her poorly.

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:15.040
Normally, she'd be too shy to accept it.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:15.920
This is good.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:17.940
Whatever she wants to eat or drink,

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.200
she can buy it herself.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.650
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:27.660
Not enough?

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.040
If it's not enough, I'll add more.

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:35.740
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:38.900
What?

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.760
Juan,

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.420
you're so kind.

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.140
Took you long enough to realize.

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.370
Is this enough or not?

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:52.210
You decide.

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:57.740
Then what will you decide?

00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:59.800
I'll follow your lead on everything.

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.580
You're killing me.

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.870
Are you done? Hurry up!

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:21.420
Is this the last box?

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:23.150
Stop talking so much.

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:24.490
Take this down too.

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:30.220
Mu,

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:33.240
are you really not coming with us
for the New Year?

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.080
Will you be okay staying here alone?

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:39.340
I'm staying here to keep Jin Zhao company.

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:41.630
You really do like him,

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:43.490
always running over to his place.

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:45.920
Here.

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.080
Here's a red envelope for you.

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:50.450
Thank you.

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:52.160
Take good care of yourself.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.260
We'll be going now.

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:55.540
Xin.

00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:59.890
Here's a red envelope for you.

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:01.590
Thank you, Sister.

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:02.530
Happy New Year.

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:03.560
Happy New Year.

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:05.820
We're going.

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:07.850
We'll be back soon.

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:12.150
Yes,

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:13.830
I do like him.

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:35.340
-Here it comes!
-Dark chocolate versus white chocolate!

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.970
-Come on, everyone.
-Come on!

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:38.700
-Let's toast!
-Cheers!

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:39.950
Happy New Year!

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:41.830
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:46.550
Nothing beats an ice-cold beer.

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:51.430
Sanlai!

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:54.580
Jiang Mu?

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:57.940
Happy New Year!

00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:58.960
Come on, come on!

00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:00.300
Why didn't you bring an umbrella
in this rain?

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.590
What if you catch a cold?

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:04.990
It's just drizzling.
Couldn't get a taxi during the New Year.

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:07.030
Why didn't you ask me to pick you up?

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:07.940
It's not far.

00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:09.410
I can come over by myself.

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:13.260
Hurry, sit.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:14.800
-Is there any food left for me?
-Come on.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.000
Of course. Of course we do.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.750
Sanlai, get her something to eat.

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:18.700
You think I need you to tell me that?

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.490
I might go hungry,
but how could I let our Jiang Mu starve?

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:20.970
I'll get you something to eat.

00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:21.890
Thanks, Sanlai.

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:22.950
Don't catch a cold.

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:28.030
Ji, you still wanna eat...

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:28.680
I get it.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:29.900
I can take a hint. I'll sit here.

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.310
I'll sit here. I'll sit here.

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:32.380
Hurry, sit, sit.

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:36.420
Come on. Let's chat.

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:37.570
About that thing last time...

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:40.370
Why aren't you spending the New Year
with your dad?

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:42.300
Mrs. Zhao suddenly said

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.860
she wanted to take Jin Xin back home
for a visit.

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:46.130
Dad drove them there.

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:48.380
They wanted me to come along too,

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:49.900
but I wanted

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:52.400
to stay and spend the New Year with you.

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:57.430
Sis, here's your tableware!

00:39:58.370 --> 00:39:59.000
Eat some.

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:00.530
Thank you.

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:05.190
Come on, Crazy!

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.650
Let's toast.

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:06.420
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:06.780
Cheers!

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:08.040
Happy New Year, Crazy.

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:22.510
Are you cold?

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:24.590
My hands are cold.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:57.300
