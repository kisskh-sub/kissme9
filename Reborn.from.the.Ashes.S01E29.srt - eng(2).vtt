[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.440
[Episode 29]

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.360
Your Highness,

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.850
you also know medical skills.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.150
Then you must understand

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.690
the Prince's poison
is attacking the heart meridian.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.110
I'm afraid...

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.960
How could this happen?

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.810
Just a few days ago,
he was perfectly fine.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.400
And this poison is strange.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.070
Neither of us can identify it.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.040
Right now, unless we find the poisoner,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.840
otherwise....

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.520
Your Highness,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.400
this was just found at the door.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.040
If you want to save him, come to me.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.230
Xuan.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.040
I am the crown princess.
I am the crown princess.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.590
I was born noble; no one can defeat me.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.800
Miss, why haven't you gone home yet?

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.040
I am the crown princess.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.230
Don't touch me.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.070
I am the crown prince.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.550
Let's go home.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.230
I am the crown princess.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.750
I'm going home.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.800
Welcome to our wedding.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.230
Prince Han, what do you mean?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.590
Well,

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.090
this is the wedding robe
I prepared for you.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.580
What do you mean by this?

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.040
I wrote the letter.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.070
I also poisoned him.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.520
Why did you do this?

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.360
Why?

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.520
Because

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.070
I want to have you.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.400
I'll kill

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.320
whoever you love.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.590
You have lost your mind.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.480
How did you end up like this?

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.960
This is my true self.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.000
Want the antidote?

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.920
Then marry me.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.960
[If you want to save him,
come to me. Xuan]

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.800
Qian.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.150
Jin.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.000
Let go of my woman.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.670
Your woman?

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.040
Sorry,

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.150
but now,

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.840
she belongs to me.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.000
Yan Shaoxuan,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.710
you openly took my wife.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.750
Aren't you afraid
the world will mock you

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.090
or that you'll face retribution?

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.960
Retribution?

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.150
Not only did I take your wife,

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.070
I also stole your account book

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.270
and exposed your true identity.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.480
Do I have any retribution?

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.840
In the end, I had both power

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.270
and beauty.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.670
Why did you do this?

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.920
So it was all your doing.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.520
I did everything

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.110
for you.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.040
Who exactly are you?

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.040
No, you're not even human.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.360
Ah.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.590
You've found me out.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.440
But,

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.630
anyone who knows my secret

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.110
must die.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.630
No!

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.590
Jin. Jin.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.670
Jin, are you alright?

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.110
Jin!

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.000
Don't!

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.150
Don't!

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.670
Jin!

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.710
Want to save him?

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.400
Say you love me,

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.440
and I'll let him go.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.800
No.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.360
Love...

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.440
I love you.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.440
Not sincere enough.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.670
No.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.040
Kiss me.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.230
No.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.850
You're crossing the line.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.860
Let's go.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.590
Hurry, let's leave.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.920
You've ruined my plan.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.800
Hey!

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.070
You were the one who sealed me first.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.880
Now you're accusing me.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.710
If you hadn't suddenly appeared,

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.540
I would have definitely won this game.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.630
It's because you kept interfering
all along.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.110
Even if you win,

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.920
it wouldn't be a fair victory.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.590
It's time to end this.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.170
Hurry and go after them.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.440
Oh.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.040
Jin.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.360
Jin,

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.190
are you alright?

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:10.920
Qian, don't worry.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:12.270
I'm fine.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.480
You've been coughing blood.
How could you be fine?

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.400
I won't die.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.110
I finally caught you.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.110
Yan Shaoxuan,

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:28.750
what exactly do you want?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.710
I want your

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.360
pure Yang blood.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.480
Once I have your pure Yang blood,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.070
I will gain supreme power.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.270
At the right moment,

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.880
I will become Lord of the Three Realms.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.800
A few lives mean nothing to me.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.750
Want to see Yunzhou City
run red with blood?

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.840
I will never let you succeed.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.670
You are no match for me.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.000
Yet you still dare to block my path.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:13.000
Jin...

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.670
Even if I lose my life,

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.150
I will fight you to the death.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.960
Don't act so righteous.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:21.590
Kindness

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.710
is just an excuse of the weak.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.880
Only power

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.800
is the law of the strong.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:35.000
Xiao Jin!

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:40.520
Don't you understand yet?

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:42.880
Now this world

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.070
is under my command.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:46.750
Yan Shaoxuan,

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.040
no matter what kind of person you are,

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.630
we will never fear you,

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:53.520
nor will we stand by
and watch you do harm.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.400
Is that so?

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.150
Want to kill me?

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.880
It's not impossible.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.270
As long as someone with pure yang blood

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.710
pulls out the spear from his chest

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.400
and stabs it into my body.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.880
Why tell us this?

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.720
You won't do such a thing.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.390
If the long spear is pulled out...

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:22.600
Jin.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.350
He will vanish into dust.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.760
On one side is a deeply loved companion,

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.840
on the other, unrelated common folk.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:32.310
Which holds more weight?

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.430
It's every man for himself.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.390
Why sacrifice yourself

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.880
for those unrelated?

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.310
you promised me
that you haven't done yet.

I'm sorry.

I'd hold our wedding ceremony with you.

Haven't we already married?

Yes, but the wedding ceremony
is not held yet.
