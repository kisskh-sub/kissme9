DYNAMITE KISS

00:00:52.282 --> 00:00:53.157
Mr. Gong.

00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:54.826
Mr. Gong, are you okay?

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.703
Wake up!

00:00:58.204 --> 00:00:59.622
Oh no…

00:01:00.165 --> 00:01:01.499
Mr. Gong!

00:01:01.583 --> 00:01:02.584
Mr. Gong…

00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:04.502
Mr. Gong?

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:08.256
Are you okay?

00:01:09.883 --> 00:01:11.342
Can you hear me?

00:01:12.093 --> 00:01:12.927
Thank goodness.

00:01:13.678 --> 00:01:15.346
Do you know how scared I was

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.515
that something might've happened to you?

00:01:41.372 --> 00:01:42.206
I need to…

00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:45.335
tell you something.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.964
There are no particular reasons

00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:52.550
as to why I like you.

00:01:54.093 --> 00:01:56.179
I just like you for who you are.

00:01:57.347 --> 00:01:58.806
You're Go Da-rim.

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:04.437
That's why I like you.

00:02:10.026 --> 00:02:10.902
I love you.

00:02:51.067 --> 00:02:53.111
I like you too.

00:02:55.571 --> 00:02:57.407
After leaving you in Jeju like that,

00:02:58.992 --> 00:03:00.660
I've always missed you

00:03:01.911 --> 00:03:03.496
and thought about you.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.666
Do you mean it?

00:03:09.293 --> 00:03:11.796
It was so hard seeing your face every day

00:03:12.463 --> 00:03:13.756
while feeling like that.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.220
I'm sorry for taking so long
to tell you how I feel.

00:03:21.055 --> 00:03:21.973
I…

00:03:24.934 --> 00:03:26.185
love you too.

00:03:42.201 --> 00:03:43.036
Ji-hyeok!

00:03:43.536 --> 00:03:45.121
Ji-hyeok!

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:47.957
Ji-hyeok, let me see you!

00:03:48.541 --> 00:03:50.710
Eyes, nose, mouth. They're all there.

00:03:51.544 --> 00:03:52.628
You're safe now!

00:03:52.712 --> 00:03:54.047
I'm fine.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.048
Let go of me.

00:03:55.131 --> 00:03:57.467
-Excuse me, can you check him out?
-Sure.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.510
I told you I'm fine. Jeez.

00:03:59.594 --> 00:04:01.262
Please hurry!

00:04:02.388 --> 00:04:04.432
-How's your breathing?
-It's fine.

00:04:04.515 --> 00:04:05.808
Ji-hyeok, breathe.

00:04:08.644 --> 00:04:10.730
Is there anything for him to drink?

00:04:10.813 --> 00:04:11.856
Do you want some water?

00:04:13.816 --> 00:04:15.651
EPISODE 11

00:04:20.073 --> 00:04:21.783
I've decided to believe
that you're serious

00:04:23.493 --> 00:04:24.535
about wanting to help.

00:04:26.412 --> 00:04:27.914
Remain calm!

00:04:27.997 --> 00:04:30.041
-Don't rush!
-Remain calm!

00:04:30.124 --> 00:04:31.542
Don't rush!

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.963
-Remain calm!
-Remain calm!

00:04:38.966 --> 00:04:40.009
Don't rush.

00:04:40.093 --> 00:04:43.179
But why are you taking it this far?

00:04:43.262 --> 00:04:44.639
Is it really just for money?

00:04:45.932 --> 00:04:48.142
I detest Ji-hyeok just as much.

00:04:49.977 --> 00:04:50.812
Why?

00:04:51.687 --> 00:04:53.773
Because you lost all the companies
you were trying to acquire

00:04:54.357 --> 00:04:56.025
to Ji-hyeok?

00:04:58.486 --> 00:04:59.946
So it's just an inferiority complex, huh?

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.574
No, I respect those who are competent.

00:05:03.658 --> 00:05:04.700
But that punk

00:05:05.785 --> 00:05:07.703
has such an arrogant look in his eyes.

00:05:07.787 --> 00:05:08.663
His eyes?

00:05:08.746 --> 00:05:10.540
"I succeeded without my father's help."

00:05:11.124 --> 00:05:12.417
"I fought fair and square."

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.961
"I'm nothing like you."

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.713
There's something oddly dismissive
about his gaze,

00:05:17.797 --> 00:05:19.424
and it really gets on my nerves.

00:05:19.507 --> 00:05:23.302
I think I'll only feel better
after I properly crush him.

00:05:24.178 --> 00:05:25.555
Acting all lofty

00:05:26.806 --> 00:05:28.850
as if he were being guided
by some noble principle.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.478
It is obnoxious.

00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:37.191
It's been a while
since we were on the same page.

00:05:43.614 --> 00:05:44.740
We're a team now, right?

00:05:55.543 --> 00:05:57.086
They found an ID badge

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.797
that belonged to a Taeyu C&T
labor union member near the office.

00:06:00.965 --> 00:06:04.760
I suspect he was one of the workers
who were laid off recently.

00:06:04.844 --> 00:06:07.430
Taeyu C&T is infamous
for its labor-management conflicts.

00:06:08.723 --> 00:06:12.101
We somehow ended up in the line of fire.

00:06:13.186 --> 00:06:14.187
I almost forgot.

00:06:15.062 --> 00:06:16.063
Ji-hyeok.

00:06:16.647 --> 00:06:17.607
About Ms. Go Da-rim…

00:06:18.816 --> 00:06:20.610
What are you going to do now?

00:06:20.693 --> 00:06:21.694
Make it clear now.

00:06:21.777 --> 00:06:22.778
What?

00:06:28.034 --> 00:06:29.744
Don't tell me you saw it.

00:06:29.827 --> 00:06:31.746
-I did.
-All of it?

00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:33.289
Yes, I saw everything.

00:06:33.998 --> 00:06:34.832
Well, that was…

00:06:35.625 --> 00:06:38.002
Gyeong-min, I think you may have
gotten the wrong idea.

00:06:38.085 --> 00:06:40.713
-I--
-Wrong idea, my foot.

00:06:40.796 --> 00:06:43.466
We all saw Ms. Go
run in there to save you.

00:06:44.508 --> 00:06:45.760
Who would risk their life

00:06:45.843 --> 00:06:49.680
to save their boss from a burning building
in this day and age?

00:06:49.764 --> 00:06:51.766
You should know how blessed you are.

00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:55.686
So stop acting like a jerk
and snapping at her

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.480
just because you're the team leader,

00:06:57.563 --> 00:06:58.648
and be nice to her.

00:06:59.357 --> 00:07:00.524
She's not just an employee.

00:07:00.608 --> 00:07:01.984
She's your savior.

00:07:02.068 --> 00:07:03.569
-Okay?
-Okay.

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:06.113
Eat your porridge.

00:07:06.697 --> 00:07:08.032
Thank you for the porridge.

00:07:08.115 --> 00:07:09.867
-Wow, what is all this?
-Eat up.

00:07:25.675 --> 00:07:26.759
No, you can't!

00:07:26.842 --> 00:07:29.470
Life may be tough,
but this isn't the answer.

00:07:29.554 --> 00:07:31.305
What the heck? Who are you?

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:32.723
Let go of me!

00:07:45.361 --> 00:07:47.488
Let's do that again.

00:07:51.367 --> 00:07:52.785
Do you know how worried I was?

00:07:53.703 --> 00:07:54.996
I didn't know if you were being chased

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:56.455
or had gotten into some sort of accident.

00:07:56.539 --> 00:07:58.541
Do you know how hard I searched for you?

00:07:58.624 --> 00:08:00.126
I know.

00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:02.336
You're nice to me

00:08:04.171 --> 00:08:07.258
only because I'm a member of your team.

00:08:07.925 --> 00:08:09.135
But still,

00:08:10.553 --> 00:08:12.013
I find myself

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.015
being swayed.

00:08:14.599 --> 00:08:15.516
I'm…

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.310
not a good person.

00:08:17.893 --> 00:08:18.728
Sorry?

00:08:19.353 --> 00:08:20.229
I'm also…

00:08:22.773 --> 00:08:23.691
swayed.

00:08:25.359 --> 00:08:26.444
Stay with me.

00:08:27.069 --> 00:08:27.945
Don't go.

00:08:29.238 --> 00:08:30.072
I don't want you to go.

00:08:32.617 --> 00:08:33.951
There are no particular reasons

00:08:35.244 --> 00:08:36.579
as to why I like you.

00:08:37.663 --> 00:08:39.957
I just like you for who you are.

00:08:40.583 --> 00:08:42.084
You're Go Da-rim.

00:08:46.464 --> 00:08:47.715
That's why I like you.

00:08:49.383 --> 00:08:50.301
I love you.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.355
This is insane.

00:10:16.595 --> 00:10:17.930
Let's see.

00:10:20.766 --> 00:10:21.600
It doesn't suit me.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.394
Yeah.

00:10:26.647 --> 00:10:27.982
This doesn't suit me either.

00:10:28.065 --> 00:10:28.899
Yes?

00:10:32.862 --> 00:10:33.696
I'm screwed.

00:10:33.779 --> 00:10:35.698
I'm so screwed.

00:10:38.993 --> 00:10:41.328
Today must be an important day.

00:10:41.412 --> 00:10:44.874
I just thought it was a shame
that all these clothes

00:10:44.957 --> 00:10:47.626
in my sister's wardrobe
were just gathering dust.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:48.961
I see.

00:10:50.296 --> 00:10:52.131
Would you like me to pick something out?

00:10:52.214 --> 00:10:53.048
Sure.

00:11:01.307 --> 00:11:02.141
Not this.

00:11:07.688 --> 00:11:08.731
How about this?

00:11:08.814 --> 00:11:10.232
I think that looks nice.

00:11:10.316 --> 00:11:11.150
You think so?

00:11:11.233 --> 00:11:12.818
Don't you think it's a bit too short?

00:11:12.902 --> 00:11:15.070
I thought something simple
would be better.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.864
You think so?

00:11:17.907 --> 00:11:21.160
I suppose this is something
Ji-hyeok would like.

00:11:24.413 --> 00:11:26.373
Goodness, what do I know?

00:11:26.457 --> 00:11:28.876
I should just trust your judgment.

00:12:02.701 --> 00:12:04.703
-Good morning, Mr. Gong.
-There he is.

00:12:04.787 --> 00:12:06.455
-Mr. Gong.
-Good morning, Mr. Gong.

00:12:06.539 --> 00:12:08.165
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:12:13.128 --> 00:12:15.589
NATURAL BEBE

00:12:15.673 --> 00:12:17.675
Isn't Mr. Gong so handsome?

00:12:19.134 --> 00:12:20.636
I wish I could join the TF team.

00:12:20.719 --> 00:12:22.680
I'd get to see that face every day.

00:12:22.763 --> 00:12:24.473
He really is a feast for the eyes.

00:12:24.557 --> 00:12:25.849
I'm so jealous.

00:12:26.892 --> 00:12:28.852
I want to join the TF team too.

00:13:01.135 --> 00:13:02.177
Hold on.

00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:07.391
You caught me off guard.

00:13:07.474 --> 00:13:09.268
We need to be careful at work.

00:13:09.768 --> 00:13:10.686
Be careful?

00:13:11.228 --> 00:13:12.062
About what?

00:13:12.146 --> 00:13:14.398
There were so many people in the elevator.

00:13:14.481 --> 00:13:16.483
You can't just hold my hand like that.

00:13:16.567 --> 00:13:17.443
Your hand?

00:13:18.193 --> 00:13:19.612
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:13:33.459 --> 00:13:34.460
I couldn't help myself

00:13:35.753 --> 00:13:37.379
because you're so pretty.

00:13:56.398 --> 00:13:58.400
Oh my goodness!

00:13:58.484 --> 00:14:01.236
-My gosh, they're so pretty!
-They are!

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.156
-They're beautiful.
-I can't believe it.

00:14:04.239 --> 00:14:05.741
Seriously, this is incredible.

00:14:05.824 --> 00:14:08.327
-My goodness.
-Just look at that note.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:10.829
"To my precious four-leaf clover."

00:14:10.913 --> 00:14:13.916
"Thank you.
I promise to only make you happier."

00:14:14.541 --> 00:14:16.335
He's so cool.

00:14:16.418 --> 00:14:20.005
Mr. Kim Seon-u is such a romantic.

00:14:20.089 --> 00:14:22.841
Someone might think
you two just started dating.

00:14:23.759 --> 00:14:26.929
He must've sent it to cheer you up,
considering how the exhibition wrapped up.

00:14:27.012 --> 00:14:30.641
I'd be happy if my husband
did a quarter of what he does.

00:14:30.724 --> 00:14:31.892
In your dreams.

00:14:31.976 --> 00:14:34.770
A husband like Mr. Kim
is rarer than winning the lottery.

00:14:34.853 --> 00:14:37.898
He's handsome, talented, and doting.

00:14:38.482 --> 00:14:42.111
Only someone as lucky and blessed
as Da-rim could land a guy like him.

00:14:43.195 --> 00:14:44.029
Now, now.

00:14:44.113 --> 00:14:45.197
You're still on the clock.

00:14:46.115 --> 00:14:47.783
Let's get back to work.

00:14:47.866 --> 00:14:48.993
Please.

00:14:49.576 --> 00:14:50.494
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:52.830
He's such a killjoy.

00:14:52.913 --> 00:14:54.081
Gosh, they're so pretty.

00:14:58.210 --> 00:14:59.086
Come in.

00:15:01.296 --> 00:15:02.172
Thank you

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:04.091
for the flowers.

00:15:05.175 --> 00:15:07.052
You didn't have to send me flowers.

00:15:07.803 --> 00:15:09.930
Thank goodness no one else caught on.

00:15:10.014 --> 00:15:11.098
Gosh.

00:15:11.181 --> 00:15:13.934
Even if no one else caught on,

00:15:14.893 --> 00:15:17.271
I sent them so you can take note.

00:15:17.354 --> 00:15:18.272
Of what?

00:15:21.608 --> 00:15:22.901
That today is day one of our relationship.

00:15:28.365 --> 00:15:30.743
Gosh, you're too much.

00:15:33.287 --> 00:15:34.997
I think they all left to buy something.

00:15:41.545 --> 00:15:42.838
I need to head out soon.

00:15:43.422 --> 00:15:45.758
I don't think I'll see you
for the rest of the day.

00:15:45.841 --> 00:15:47.760
Well, it can't be helped.

00:15:54.475 --> 00:15:55.642
You can't do it here.

00:15:59.021 --> 00:15:59.897
Not here…

00:16:01.106 --> 00:16:02.941
We have so much to do.

00:16:03.025 --> 00:16:03.901
I know.

00:16:03.984 --> 00:16:05.194
Oh no. They're back. What should we do?

00:16:05.277 --> 00:16:06.862
Hold on. Maybe I should…

00:16:06.945 --> 00:16:07.821
Did you reach out?

00:16:07.905 --> 00:16:09.198
-Ms. Go Da-rim!
-Oh my.

00:16:10.282 --> 00:16:11.408
Do you call this work?

00:16:12.367 --> 00:16:13.285
I'm sorry.

00:16:13.368 --> 00:16:15.454
-I'm really sorry, sir.
-Poor Da-rim.

00:16:15.537 --> 00:16:17.873
What set him off this time?
He's such a jerk.

00:16:18.791 --> 00:16:19.625
Oh no.

00:16:19.708 --> 00:16:20.709
Are you free this weekend?

00:16:20.793 --> 00:16:23.504
Yes, I am. Why do you ask?

00:16:23.587 --> 00:16:24.505
Let's go on a date.

00:16:25.881 --> 00:16:27.132
Is there anything you want to eat?

00:16:27.216 --> 00:16:28.342
We can go get something to eat.

00:16:28.425 --> 00:16:29.551
A movie sounds good too.

00:16:29.635 --> 00:16:30.511
Or maybe even a trip.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.473
It's not like Da-rim started the fire.
We're also upset about it.

00:16:34.556 --> 00:16:35.724
He's just taking it too far.

00:16:35.808 --> 00:16:37.559
I've had enough of it.
I need to get in there.

00:16:38.602 --> 00:16:40.312
You'll only make things worse now.

00:16:40.395 --> 00:16:42.397
I'll go and talk to him in a bit.

00:16:43.315 --> 00:16:45.400
Come here. Quickly.

00:16:47.111 --> 00:16:48.070
-Should I go now?
-What's he doing?

00:16:48.153 --> 00:16:50.114
What is it? What's he doing?

00:16:50.197 --> 00:16:51.406
Overnight is even better.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:52.616
Overnight?

00:16:52.699 --> 00:16:54.576
Isn't that a bit too soon?

00:16:55.661 --> 00:16:56.745
Don't you remember what happened in Jeju?

00:16:56.829 --> 00:16:57.871
We were totally--

00:16:57.955 --> 00:16:59.915
All right, okay. I hear you.

00:17:00.415 --> 00:17:01.750
I'll think about it.

00:17:01.834 --> 00:17:02.918
Just trust me and follow my lead!

00:17:03.001 --> 00:17:04.545
-Oh my goodness.
-Oh dear.

00:17:04.628 --> 00:17:06.338
-Get in there and stop him.
-Go stop him.

00:17:06.421 --> 00:17:07.673
Should I get in there now?

00:17:07.756 --> 00:17:09.216
Something serious is about to happen.

00:17:11.844 --> 00:17:15.806
Unfortunately,
the fire is the issue in the spotlight

00:17:15.889 --> 00:17:17.683
instead of the exhibition.

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:22.354
"How could an environmental campaign
ignore fire safety?"

00:17:22.437 --> 00:17:24.606
"You might as well just drop everything."

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.775
Such snide reactions have been prevalent.

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:28.652
How could you handle the situation
so unprofessionally?

00:17:28.735 --> 00:17:29.945
Sir.

00:17:30.445 --> 00:17:32.781
Mr. Gong was also in danger that day.

00:17:33.949 --> 00:17:34.908
For now,

00:17:34.992 --> 00:17:37.411
Taeyu C&T has agreed
to announce that the culprit

00:17:37.494 --> 00:17:39.997
was one of its former labor union members,
not any mismanagement on our part--

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.332
A little late for that, don't you think?

00:17:43.333 --> 00:17:44.710
Has that person been apprehended?

00:17:44.793 --> 00:17:46.503
Well, not yet.

00:17:46.587 --> 00:17:48.755
Then a laborer being the culprit
is still only speculation.

00:17:48.839 --> 00:17:50.132
Nothing has been confirmed.

00:17:50.924 --> 00:17:52.342
A further investigation has to be--

00:17:52.426 --> 00:17:54.136
No, just leave it be.

00:17:54.219 --> 00:17:55.762
They agreed to take the fall.

00:17:56.346 --> 00:17:58.599
Let's conclude today's meeting here.

00:18:03.395 --> 00:18:04.438
How are you feeling?

00:18:05.397 --> 00:18:07.232
-Better?
-Yeah.

00:18:07.941 --> 00:18:08.984
Thanks for your concern.

00:18:09.526 --> 00:18:10.485
I didn't do anything.

00:18:11.862 --> 00:18:13.572
You should be thanking Ms. Go.

00:18:13.655 --> 00:18:15.574
I heard she risked her life to save you.

00:18:17.534 --> 00:18:19.119
You two must be close.

00:18:19.703 --> 00:18:20.996
Just like any team leader and member.

00:18:21.747 --> 00:18:22.706
I'm envious.

00:18:23.874 --> 00:18:26.001
It must be nice to have
a team member like that.

00:18:30.172 --> 00:18:31.006
All right then.

00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:33.425
Take care of yourself.

00:18:52.611 --> 00:18:53.570
Hey.

00:18:53.654 --> 00:18:55.447
Hey. Do you have what I asked for?

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:56.448
Yeah.

00:18:56.531 --> 00:18:57.824
These are all the CCTV footage

00:18:57.908 --> 00:18:59.743
from inside and outside
the art hall for the past week.

00:19:02.412 --> 00:19:03.413
Thanks.

00:19:03.497 --> 00:19:05.624
You're right. It's a bit suspicious.

00:19:05.707 --> 00:19:09.962
If he managed to reach the office
without being caught on the CCTVs,

00:19:10.045 --> 00:19:12.547
that means he knew the layout
of the art hall well.

00:19:12.631 --> 00:19:14.424
I'm sure
he scoped the place out beforehand.

00:19:16.093 --> 00:19:17.427
Then he must be in here somewhere.

00:19:19.596 --> 00:19:21.139
Are you going to watch
a whole week's worth of footage?

00:19:21.723 --> 00:19:23.433
There's going to be
a ton of people on there.

00:19:23.517 --> 00:19:24.518
Will you even recognize him?

00:19:34.736 --> 00:19:35.988
I definitely remember his eyes.

00:19:48.834 --> 00:19:51.962
You must be upset about the exhibition
ending in such a way.

00:19:52.045 --> 00:19:54.715
It's fine.
I'm just thankful no one got hurt.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:57.592
How's Mr. Gong?

00:19:58.468 --> 00:19:59.303
Is he all right?

00:20:00.053 --> 00:20:02.556
Yeah, he says he's fine.

00:20:24.703 --> 00:20:26.830
Listen, Seon-u.

00:20:28.415 --> 00:20:29.750
About what you told me last time--

00:20:29.833 --> 00:20:33.253
I just remembered
I have an urgent project to finish up.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.922
I need to send it over
by tomorrow morning.

00:20:36.548 --> 00:20:38.467
Sorry, Da-rim. Let's talk later.

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:39.509
Right, okay.

00:20:39.593 --> 00:20:41.178
Of course, work comes first.

00:20:41.261 --> 00:20:42.596
I can clean this up later.

00:20:44.348 --> 00:20:46.058
All right then.

00:20:46.141 --> 00:20:47.601
I'll get going.

00:20:47.684 --> 00:20:49.102
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:21:32.646 --> 00:21:34.064
This looks delicious.

00:21:41.571 --> 00:21:42.572
It's so good.

00:21:43.824 --> 00:21:45.283
The egg is so soft.

00:21:46.785 --> 00:21:47.869
Hold on.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:49.746
Who's softer?

00:21:50.831 --> 00:21:51.748
The egg or me?

00:21:52.374 --> 00:21:53.750
Are you serious?

00:21:55.001 --> 00:21:56.211
Answer me.

00:21:56.294 --> 00:21:57.129
The egg or me?

00:21:57.879 --> 00:21:58.964
Of course…

00:21:59.589 --> 00:22:00.507
it's the egg.

00:22:01.425 --> 00:22:03.593
I wouldn't call you the soft type.

00:22:04.428 --> 00:22:05.720
Then what am I?

00:22:07.097 --> 00:22:08.890
You're…

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:13.145
a bit more

00:22:13.937 --> 00:22:14.813
of the sexy type.

00:22:16.481 --> 00:22:17.399
I guess.

00:22:18.817 --> 00:22:20.026
So that's what I am.

00:22:21.236 --> 00:22:23.029
Okay. Eat up.

00:22:25.615 --> 00:22:26.533
You know,

00:22:27.284 --> 00:22:29.286
it's so nice to be able to
go on lunch dates like this.

00:22:29.369 --> 00:22:31.329
I think office romances are great.

00:22:32.205 --> 00:22:33.665
-Are you enjoying it?
-Yeah.

00:22:33.748 --> 00:22:35.125
When I start my own company,

00:22:36.168 --> 00:22:38.420
I'm going to make office romances
a requirement for all employees.

00:22:38.503 --> 00:22:39.337
What?

00:22:40.839 --> 00:22:43.091
When I woke up this morning,

00:22:43.633 --> 00:22:46.469
I was so excited to go to work.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:54.144
If every employee were as eager
to get to work as I am,

00:22:54.227 --> 00:22:56.563
just imagine how productive they'd be.

00:22:57.063 --> 00:22:59.649
Do that at your own company.

00:22:59.733 --> 00:23:02.402
What if someone from the office sees us?

00:23:03.069 --> 00:23:04.863
Do you know how anxious I am?

00:23:04.946 --> 00:23:05.947
That's why

00:23:06.907 --> 00:23:09.326
I chose a place far away from the office.
So smart, right?

00:23:11.119 --> 00:23:11.995
Yes.

00:23:15.207 --> 00:23:16.708
Thank you for lunch.

00:23:16.791 --> 00:23:18.585
I'll be sure to treat you next time.

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:21.504
Should we take a walk before heading back?

00:23:22.005 --> 00:23:22.964
Sure, why not?

00:23:31.765 --> 00:23:33.016
Come on.

00:23:33.099 --> 00:23:35.435
What if someone sees us?

00:23:35.518 --> 00:23:37.312
But what can I do?
I like you so much, it's killing me.

00:23:37.395 --> 00:23:41.316
-I mean, I guess we can't let you die.
-Come on. It'll be fine.

00:23:41.399 --> 00:23:43.610
I made sure no one we know is around.

00:23:50.367 --> 00:23:51.368
Such nice weather today.

00:23:52.202 --> 00:23:53.578
-No, Nan-suk.
-No.

00:23:53.662 --> 00:23:55.288
Did we have to come this far for lunch?

00:23:55.372 --> 00:23:57.332
Trust me. It's a really good place.

00:24:01.169 --> 00:24:03.380
-Most sandwiches are so small.
-What's going on?

00:24:03.463 --> 00:24:05.465
I hate thin sandwiches.
Sandwiches need to be thick.

00:24:05.548 --> 00:24:06.633
-They do?
-Damn it.

00:24:06.716 --> 00:24:08.885
-Really?
-That won't be filling.

00:24:08.969 --> 00:24:09.928
Isn't that Ms. Go?

00:24:10.011 --> 00:24:12.555
Hello, everyone!

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.893
Didn't you say you were meeting a friend?

00:24:16.977 --> 00:24:20.689
Oh, they had something urgent come up.

00:24:21.314 --> 00:24:22.274
Something urgent?

00:24:28.238 --> 00:24:29.990
Just a second. Please.

00:24:30.073 --> 00:24:31.574
You were stood up.

00:24:31.658 --> 00:24:33.952
Oh no, that's too bad.

00:24:36.496 --> 00:24:38.581
Did you have lunch already?

00:24:38.665 --> 00:24:41.543
There's this new sandwich place nearby.

00:24:41.626 --> 00:24:43.169
-That's where we're headed.
-Really?

00:24:44.129 --> 00:24:46.214
You have to go this way to get there.

00:24:46.298 --> 00:24:47.590
-What?
-I think it's this way.

00:24:47.674 --> 00:24:49.467
There's a sinkhole over there.

00:25:21.207 --> 00:25:22.042
Come in.

00:25:27.922 --> 00:25:28.840
Mr. Gong.

00:25:28.923 --> 00:25:32.594
Would you like to have dinner
at my place tonight?

00:25:32.677 --> 00:25:35.972
Our mothers made dumplings,
and they wanted you to come over.

00:25:36.848 --> 00:25:38.725
I don't think I can today.

00:25:39.309 --> 00:25:40.185
Why not?

00:25:40.268 --> 00:25:41.978
I'm on a treasure hunt.

00:25:44.981 --> 00:25:47.525
I never knew there was a place like this
in the company.

00:25:48.568 --> 00:25:50.779
I only know about it
because the CSR team leader told me.

00:25:53.281 --> 00:25:55.742
By the way, you don't need to help me.

00:25:55.825 --> 00:25:57.827
You can't go through all this by yourself.

00:25:57.911 --> 00:25:59.954
Not to mention, you have to find it
without getting caught.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:02.207
So of course, I'm going to help you.

00:26:05.085 --> 00:26:06.252
Who's there?

00:26:22.268 --> 00:26:23.228
Oh, there's no one.

00:26:32.153 --> 00:26:34.030
-He hasn't left yet.
-Really?

00:26:35.407 --> 00:26:37.367
What are you doing?

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:38.952
Hold on, he's still there. Be quiet.

00:26:39.035 --> 00:26:39.953
Okay.

00:26:43.915 --> 00:26:45.834
Oh, come on. What are you doing?

00:26:51.214 --> 00:26:54.926
The more I learn about your mother,
the more amazing she is.

00:26:55.009 --> 00:26:56.553
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR KIM IN-AE
LEADS THE TREE-PLANTING CAMPAIGN

00:26:56.636 --> 00:26:57.804
I'm sure

00:26:58.555 --> 00:27:01.182
prioritizing the company's
social responsibilities

00:27:02.434 --> 00:27:03.768
couldn't have been easy back then.

00:27:04.477 --> 00:27:05.478
My mom

00:27:06.521 --> 00:27:08.523
wasn't looking to just sell baby products.

00:27:10.358 --> 00:27:13.027
She wanted to create a world
that ensured children's happiness.

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:18.783
It looks like that led to
a lot of conflict with the board members.

00:27:20.243 --> 00:27:21.327
She's a total warrior.

00:27:23.079 --> 00:27:24.164
It looks that way.

00:27:25.999 --> 00:27:28.543
MANAGEMENT MEETING MINUTES

00:27:34.591 --> 00:27:36.384
I always thought of my mom

00:27:37.886 --> 00:27:39.721
as someone weak I needed to protect.

00:27:43.683 --> 00:27:45.560
She's incredibly strong.

00:27:46.728 --> 00:27:48.396
She's even fighting now.

00:27:50.773 --> 00:27:51.691
So,

00:27:53.151 --> 00:27:57.405
I hope you don't try to shoulder
all of this on your own anymore.

00:28:02.452 --> 00:28:04.871
Your mother told me

00:28:05.538 --> 00:28:08.374
about your childhood.

00:28:12.045 --> 00:28:14.214
Why did she waste your time like that?

00:28:14.297 --> 00:28:16.090
It wasn't a waste of time.

00:28:16.674 --> 00:28:18.885
Thanks to her, all my questions about you

00:28:19.761 --> 00:28:20.887
were answered.

00:28:21.513 --> 00:28:23.056
What questions did you have?

00:28:24.891 --> 00:28:26.100
You could've asked me.

00:28:31.981 --> 00:28:33.816
I wondered why someone

00:28:35.401 --> 00:28:36.778
who has everything and more

00:28:38.154 --> 00:28:40.281
sometimes had a wounded look in his eyes.

00:28:41.074 --> 00:28:43.868
I wondered why someone who's more mature
and reliable than anyone

00:28:45.161 --> 00:28:46.454
sometimes…

00:28:48.456 --> 00:28:51.084
looked like a lost child.

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:53.753
I thought about…

00:28:56.297 --> 00:28:58.842
how scared and tough
it must've been for that child.

00:29:06.724 --> 00:29:07.892
You must've been…

00:29:11.104 --> 00:29:12.522
really lonely.

00:29:14.607 --> 00:29:15.483
It's okay.

00:29:17.235 --> 00:29:18.152
You're okay.

00:29:20.572 --> 00:29:22.031
You're not alone anymore.

00:29:25.368 --> 00:29:27.287
I'll always be by your side.

00:29:29.414 --> 00:29:30.748
From now on until forever.

00:29:44.596 --> 00:29:46.389
I'll be here to hold you,

00:29:46.931 --> 00:29:48.474
adore you,

00:29:49.809 --> 00:29:51.144
and protect you.

00:29:54.606 --> 00:29:55.523
And…

00:29:57.191 --> 00:29:58.693
we're going to tackle all of it together.

00:30:00.194 --> 00:30:01.029
The hard stuff,

00:30:02.071 --> 00:30:03.114
the scary stuff,

00:30:03.907 --> 00:30:04.949
and the loneliness.

00:30:05.658 --> 00:30:06.784
All of it.

00:30:14.834 --> 00:30:15.793
Thank you.

00:30:34.103 --> 00:30:35.188
Goodness.

00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:54.415
Mr. Kim?

00:30:54.499 --> 00:30:56.501
-Oh, hello.
-Hello.

00:30:56.584 --> 00:30:59.253
Did you go grocery shopping
on your way home?

00:30:59.837 --> 00:31:01.339
-Yes.
-Where's Da-rim?

00:31:01.422 --> 00:31:03.132
She should be at home.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:04.634
By any chance,

00:31:04.717 --> 00:31:08.304
did you and Da-rim
receive some good news recently?

00:31:08.972 --> 00:31:10.264
Are you two expecting again?

00:31:11.015 --> 00:31:12.183
Not at all.

00:31:12.266 --> 00:31:16.229
No? Then why did you send
that giant flower basket to the office?

00:31:16.813 --> 00:31:18.272
"To my precious four-leaf clover."

00:31:18.356 --> 00:31:20.400
"I promise to only make you happier."
My gosh!

00:31:21.192 --> 00:31:23.236
It made everyone in the office go crazy!

00:31:23.319 --> 00:31:24.445
I almost fainted.

00:31:24.529 --> 00:31:26.614
Da-rim was ecstatic too.

00:31:27.448 --> 00:31:30.076
I'm glad she liked it.

00:31:36.332 --> 00:31:37.166
Seon-u.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:44.674
Hey.

00:32:00.898 --> 00:32:02.567
Did you pick up groceries?

00:32:03.568 --> 00:32:04.402
Yeah.

00:32:04.944 --> 00:32:06.779
Jun wanted bulgogi for dinner.

00:32:06.863 --> 00:32:08.489
I see.

00:32:19.625 --> 00:32:20.460
Seon-u.

00:32:23.046 --> 00:32:25.757
I have something to tell you.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.759
-Da-rim.
-Yeah?

00:32:27.842 --> 00:32:29.343
Let me speak first.

00:32:30.136 --> 00:32:30.970
Okay.

00:32:35.808 --> 00:32:37.685
Remember when I told you that I liked you?

00:32:40.229 --> 00:32:41.064
Yeah?

00:32:45.985 --> 00:32:49.572
Messing with you is not fun at all.

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.824
What do you mean?

00:32:51.908 --> 00:32:54.994
It felt like I was the only one losing out
from this whole married couple charade.

00:32:55.078 --> 00:32:58.331
I thought it was unfair, so I wanted to
mess with you by saying I liked you,

00:32:58.414 --> 00:32:59.457
but I can't do this anymore.

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:01.876
It's making my skin crawl.

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:03.836
You were messing with me

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:06.130
when you said you had feelings for me?

00:33:06.214 --> 00:33:08.591
Yeah, I was.

00:33:09.675 --> 00:33:10.593
What?

00:33:11.344 --> 00:33:12.512
Wait.

00:33:12.595 --> 00:33:15.431
That stroked your ego, didn't it?

00:33:17.433 --> 00:33:19.227
I can't just stand by and let that happen.

00:33:19.811 --> 00:33:22.522
I mean, even if it's just a joke,

00:33:22.605 --> 00:33:25.691
some lines shouldn't be crossed.

00:33:26.359 --> 00:33:27.318
Are you kidding me?

00:33:27.401 --> 00:33:28.277
Hey.

00:33:29.153 --> 00:33:30.613
That hurts.

00:33:30.696 --> 00:33:31.531
Hey,

00:33:32.615 --> 00:33:35.868
do you know how worried I was
about hurting your feelings?

00:33:35.952 --> 00:33:37.745
You're my only friend.

00:33:37.829 --> 00:33:41.374
Do you even know
how terrified I was of losing you?

00:33:45.419 --> 00:33:46.420
Why would you be scared?

00:33:47.588 --> 00:33:49.090
You're stronger than me.

00:33:49.173 --> 00:33:51.092
Come here. You're dead meat.

00:33:51.175 --> 00:33:53.636
-Wait. Stop.
-Do you know what you put me through?

00:33:53.719 --> 00:33:56.180
-Hold on a second.
-I should beat you up right now!

00:33:56.264 --> 00:33:58.766
-You'd better stop right there!
-Come on, it was just a joke.

00:34:01.519 --> 00:34:03.062
No, you're looking down too much.

00:34:03.146 --> 00:34:04.564
Look up.

00:34:04.647 --> 00:34:05.523
Too much.

00:34:05.606 --> 00:34:06.732
Just a bit. There you go.

00:34:06.816 --> 00:34:08.818
You have no energy right now.

00:34:08.901 --> 00:34:10.194
You need to be more upbeat.

00:34:10.278 --> 00:34:11.320
Lift that spirit.

00:34:11.404 --> 00:34:12.989
The expression is crucial.

00:34:13.072 --> 00:34:15.616
You want to look poised, chic, and lovely.

00:34:16.868 --> 00:34:17.785
There you go.

00:34:18.452 --> 00:34:20.621
No. Your head is tilted. Straighten it.

00:34:20.705 --> 00:34:22.582
Maintain posture. Up.

00:34:22.665 --> 00:34:24.375
Did Father leave already?

00:34:24.458 --> 00:34:25.751
Yeah.

00:34:26.586 --> 00:34:30.423
He has a lot to deal with
after the fire reignited union issues.

00:34:30.506 --> 00:34:32.508
I can't face our in-laws.

00:34:33.467 --> 00:34:34.468
Did Ji-hyeok say anything?

00:34:34.552 --> 00:34:38.014
He just wants to find the culprit
as soon as possible.

00:34:38.097 --> 00:34:40.766
It's not even a big deal.
We should just move on.

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:42.143
What do you mean it's not a big deal?

00:34:42.226 --> 00:34:43.853
I worked really hard on that exhibition.

00:34:44.854 --> 00:34:48.065
I'm sure this was a malicious attack
meant to sabotage me.

00:34:50.651 --> 00:34:52.445
Hey, snap out of it.

00:34:52.528 --> 00:34:53.905
Who'd start a fire to sabotage you?

00:34:53.988 --> 00:34:56.616
Don't say that.
She's made substantial progress.

00:34:56.699 --> 00:34:58.367
The visitors in the morning

00:34:58.451 --> 00:35:01.412
and the VIPs who received the pamphlets
are very interested in purchasing.

00:35:02.246 --> 00:35:03.748
Really? Is that true?

00:35:03.831 --> 00:35:05.541
He's quite good
for a no-name photographer.

00:35:06.626 --> 00:35:09.086
You have a good eye for things,
just like me.

00:35:09.754 --> 00:35:12.006
Prepare for a second showing
after the restoration.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.051
Thanks, Mom! I promise to do my best.

00:35:15.134 --> 00:35:16.928
Great, let's keep up that lively spirit.
Head up!

00:35:24.393 --> 00:35:25.853
What's with the long face?

00:35:25.937 --> 00:35:27.313
This is good news.

00:35:28.189 --> 00:35:29.148
Aren't you excited?

00:35:29.232 --> 00:35:30.149
Sure.

00:35:31.108 --> 00:35:31.984
I'm glad to hear it.

00:35:34.654 --> 00:35:37.448
I hurriedly came here to tell you
before telling Ji-hyeok.

00:35:43.579 --> 00:35:44.830
Come here.

00:35:47.708 --> 00:35:48.626
What are you doing?

00:35:49.293 --> 00:35:50.127
Consoling you.

00:35:50.878 --> 00:35:52.964
What's with the random consolation?

00:35:53.673 --> 00:35:54.966
Just be quiet.

00:35:55.049 --> 00:35:58.469
It's obvious
you're in desperate need of some.

00:36:02.306 --> 00:36:03.683
Ms. Go rejected you, didn't she?

00:36:05.268 --> 00:36:07.395
How did you know?

00:36:09.397 --> 00:36:11.357
It's only going to get harder from now on.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:14.026
You have to pretend like you're fine,
as if nothing happened.

00:36:15.319 --> 00:36:18.406
It's heartbreaking
when you put on a brave face,

00:36:18.906 --> 00:36:20.408
but it goes unrecognized.

00:36:23.703 --> 00:36:25.538
But you should be thankful.

00:36:25.621 --> 00:36:26.831
You have a woman of my stature

00:36:26.914 --> 00:36:29.125
patiently waiting for you.

00:36:30.626 --> 00:36:32.211
This is just too unfair for me.

00:36:32.795 --> 00:36:35.214
Go and get me some coffee or something.

00:36:35.298 --> 00:36:36.841
I refuse to leave with nothing today.

00:36:38.175 --> 00:36:39.135
Go on.

00:36:46.475 --> 00:36:47.643
The Green Forest Campaign

00:36:48.686 --> 00:36:49.895
can be taken off your hands now, Ji-hyeok.

00:36:50.563 --> 00:36:52.273
-The marketing team will take over.
-Pardon?

00:36:52.356 --> 00:36:54.025
As in my team, sir?

00:36:54.608 --> 00:36:56.485
This campaign is a long-term project.

00:36:56.569 --> 00:36:59.697
To maintain strategic direction
and established partnerships,

00:37:00.281 --> 00:37:02.116
it'd be best for my team to continue--

00:37:02.199 --> 00:37:04.493
That's exactly why he wants
another team to take over.

00:37:05.077 --> 00:37:07.121
The Mother TF Team
is made up of fixed-term interns.

00:37:07.204 --> 00:37:10.124
Even if some become full-time,
it'll be difficult to keep the team.

00:37:10.875 --> 00:37:12.335
To keep the campaign going,

00:37:12.418 --> 00:37:14.545
shouldn't we have
a permanent team dedicated to it?

00:37:14.628 --> 00:37:16.213
You don't need to worry about that.

00:37:16.839 --> 00:37:19.925
If you entrust it to me,
I promise to give it my all.

00:37:21.135 --> 00:37:22.762
Then how about

00:37:22.845 --> 00:37:25.139
sending the Mother TF Team
to support the CS team?

00:37:25.222 --> 00:37:27.433
-The CS team?
-Yes.

00:37:27.516 --> 00:37:30.019
They can listen to customers' needs
and requests firsthand

00:37:30.102 --> 00:37:31.479
and utilize that knowledge

00:37:32.104 --> 00:37:34.106
in product development.

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:38.527
I believe that'll benefit
Mr. Gong in the end as well.

00:37:38.611 --> 00:37:39.779
Sure. Sounds good.

00:37:45.326 --> 00:37:48.329
How did you ever think of that?

00:37:48.412 --> 00:37:51.499
The CS team has the highest turnover rate
in the company.

00:37:51.582 --> 00:37:54.210
I wonder if those stay-at-home moms
will even survive ten days there.

00:37:54.794 --> 00:37:56.962
Have the CS team transfer over

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.674
the most problematic
blacklisted customer cases

00:38:01.342 --> 00:38:03.094
to the Mother TF Team.

00:38:05.054 --> 00:38:07.306
I'm going to get rid of the whole team.

00:38:09.141 --> 00:38:12.436
PROVIDING WORDS OF EMPATHY
THAT RESONATE WITH CUSTOMERS!

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.438
HEARING OUT THE CUSTOMERS
TO RESPOND WITH EMPATHY!

00:38:20.528 --> 00:38:22.029
What a fun way to put it.

00:38:22.696 --> 00:38:24.698
What can I help you with today?

00:38:24.782 --> 00:38:26.909
SERVICE LEVEL: 91%
RESPONSE RATE: 97%

00:38:26.992 --> 00:38:27.952
CALLS IN PROGRESS: 45

00:38:28.035 --> 00:38:28.869
Dry cleaning?

00:38:29.453 --> 00:38:31.288
Yes, I can submit the request, but…

00:38:31.372 --> 00:38:33.332
I understand you're an influencer,

00:38:33.416 --> 00:38:36.085
but a refund request
for ten times the original amount…

00:38:36.168 --> 00:38:37.461
I'm sorry.

00:38:37.545 --> 00:38:40.589
Ma'am, I actually own
that same luxury bag.

00:38:40.673 --> 00:38:41.882
It's not that expensive--

00:38:54.728 --> 00:38:56.814
Are we sure we're still in Korea?

00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:00.067
I'm speaking Korean,
but they don't understand me.

00:39:00.151 --> 00:39:04.321
Damn that influencer,
influenza, or whatever.

00:39:04.905 --> 00:39:06.449
I mean, I can curse too.

00:39:06.532 --> 00:39:08.117
Unbelievable.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.201
I need a drink.

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:10.744
What are you doing?

00:39:10.828 --> 00:39:12.121
Relieving stress.

00:39:12.204 --> 00:39:14.457
I'm going to buy everything in my cart.

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:15.458
Are you nuts?

00:39:15.541 --> 00:39:17.626
Are you going to blow a month's pay
after working half a day?

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:21.380
Doing this is the only thing
keeping me from a breakdown.

00:39:22.423 --> 00:39:24.425
Wait, where did Go-eun go?

00:39:25.801 --> 00:39:28.095
One of the customers earlier

00:39:28.679 --> 00:39:30.890
said that there was no way
I could be a decent mom.

00:39:30.973 --> 00:39:32.766
Who the hell said that?

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:34.810
Don't listen to people like that.

00:39:35.394 --> 00:39:36.645
Why would you cry

00:39:38.314 --> 00:39:39.523
over someone like that?

00:39:40.649 --> 00:39:41.650
I know I shouldn't.

00:39:43.903 --> 00:39:46.030
I do, but it was still so upsetting.

00:39:46.113 --> 00:39:47.114
Look at me.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.158
Ms. Lee,

00:39:50.159 --> 00:39:51.452
you're a great mother.

00:39:52.995 --> 00:39:54.205
I can guarantee you that.

00:39:54.288 --> 00:39:55.623
Thank you.

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.218
The chairman is here.
Please prepare some tea.

00:40:07.301 --> 00:40:08.219
Okay.

00:40:16.894 --> 00:40:18.854
I'd love to see my daughter-in-law
more frequently.

00:40:18.938 --> 00:40:20.231
I'll visit more often, Father.

00:40:20.814 --> 00:40:23.526
And I'm sorry for causing you distress
for what happened last time.

00:40:23.609 --> 00:40:25.903
Don't be silly. Things like that happen
when running a business.

00:40:26.487 --> 00:40:29.156
Let Chairman Yu know
not to worry about us as well.

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.658
I will.

00:40:30.741 --> 00:40:32.952
I can see that Ji-hyeok
is generous and understanding

00:40:33.035 --> 00:40:34.328
because he takes after you.

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:46.423
Did they have to
take their acting that far?

00:40:46.507 --> 00:40:48.759
Are they trying to win an Oscar or what?

00:40:48.842 --> 00:40:50.094
Damn it.

00:40:50.177 --> 00:40:51.053
Right?

00:40:52.054 --> 00:40:54.056
I should find a dress for the red carpet.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:55.849
Did you hear all that?

00:40:55.933 --> 00:40:58.852
Don't worry. It's all just an act
at the end of the day.

00:40:59.478 --> 00:41:01.814
And I actually like someone else.

00:41:02.481 --> 00:41:05.401
Someone much more handsome
and cool than Gong Ji-hyeok.

00:41:06.026 --> 00:41:07.778
Does a man like that exist?

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.154
Mr. Kim.

00:41:09.738 --> 00:41:10.948
What, Seon-u?

00:41:15.828 --> 00:41:19.206
Wait, then you knew about it too?

00:41:20.749 --> 00:41:21.959
That Seon-u and I…

00:41:22.042 --> 00:41:23.961
Since we're on the subject,

00:41:24.628 --> 00:41:26.422
how about a drink tonight?

00:41:27.172 --> 00:41:28.132
Fake wife.

00:41:28.215 --> 00:41:29.174
Fake girlfriend.

00:41:30.301 --> 00:41:32.136
I think we'd have a lot to talk about.

00:41:33.971 --> 00:41:35.389
Cheers.

00:41:40.185 --> 00:41:43.439
So you guys just went for it
on the very first day you met?

00:41:44.481 --> 00:41:45.399
Yes.

00:41:46.191 --> 00:41:49.945
So much for being so indifferent.
Who knew there was such a side to him?

00:41:50.571 --> 00:41:53.407
-This is why you can't trust men.
-Oh, let me.

00:41:54.158 --> 00:41:56.952
Why do you like Seon-u?

00:41:57.036 --> 00:41:57.911
Is he nice to you?

00:41:58.495 --> 00:42:00.789
No. He treats me terribly.

00:42:00.873 --> 00:42:03.626
He always plays hard to get
and pushes me away.

00:42:03.709 --> 00:42:05.711
-It's so tiring.
-Then why do you like him?

00:42:07.838 --> 00:42:10.132
I'm jealous of this woman in a photo.

00:42:10.841 --> 00:42:11.675
Pardon?

00:42:16.013 --> 00:42:17.097
You see,

00:42:18.057 --> 00:42:20.392
I've always lived the life
my dad chose for me.

00:42:21.268 --> 00:42:23.020
If I fell a little short
of his expectations,

00:42:23.103 --> 00:42:24.730
I was dismissed, ignored,

00:42:24.813 --> 00:42:27.566
and compared to my older brother.

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:30.319
When my father told me
he didn't expect anything from me anymore

00:42:30.861 --> 00:42:34.531
and that my duty would be fulfilled
if I just married Ji-hyeok,

00:42:34.615 --> 00:42:35.908
I was honestly so happy.

00:42:36.492 --> 00:42:37.618
I thought I could finally be free.

00:42:37.701 --> 00:42:40.371
I could sense the freedom
I'd been wanting.

00:42:45.501 --> 00:42:46.418
But…

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:51.632
I realized something
when I saw how Mr. Kim looked at children.

00:42:53.676 --> 00:42:56.345
What I really wanted wasn't freedom.

00:42:57.346 --> 00:43:00.391
It was for someone to look at me
with warm, loving eyes.

00:43:05.562 --> 00:43:08.232
I thought if I were with a man like him,

00:43:08.899 --> 00:43:13.487
I could also smile brightly
like the woman in the photo one day.

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:16.115
When you say the woman in the photo…

00:43:17.032 --> 00:43:19.702
So you liked him
even though you knew from the start?

00:43:19.785 --> 00:43:21.453
It made me like him even more.

00:43:22.037 --> 00:43:24.289
Because he was still capable
of being so warm

00:43:24.373 --> 00:43:26.500
despite failing at love
and being hurt by it.

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:29.253
That's true.

00:43:29.837 --> 00:43:32.214
I've known him for over 20 years,

00:43:32.297 --> 00:43:34.174
and he's always been like that.

00:43:34.258 --> 00:43:35.342
It's pretty amazing.

00:43:36.051 --> 00:43:37.219
That's why I decided

00:43:37.928 --> 00:43:40.764
to become his windbreaker
in this cold, cruel world

00:43:40.848 --> 00:43:43.100
and guard that warmth
for the rest of my life.

00:43:43.684 --> 00:43:45.561
For both him and Jun, of course.

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:51.275
I'm relieved.

00:43:51.859 --> 00:43:52.693
What?

00:43:52.776 --> 00:43:54.278
To be honest,

00:43:55.779 --> 00:43:58.782
I was worried
that it might've been a situation

00:43:59.908 --> 00:44:02.536
where the daughter of a chaebol family

00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:07.499
found out about Seon-u's predicament
and grew curious out of pity.

00:44:08.292 --> 00:44:09.543
But I was wrong.

00:44:10.878 --> 00:44:11.795
Thank you

00:44:12.838 --> 00:44:15.674
for seeing him for who he is.

00:44:16.925 --> 00:44:21.013
You probably recognized that in him
because you're just as warmhearted.

00:44:22.598 --> 00:44:25.225
But it's not easy to win him over.

00:44:25.851 --> 00:44:26.935
He's so odd.

00:44:27.436 --> 00:44:29.813
Maybe he doesn't like pretty women.

00:44:29.897 --> 00:44:31.356
That could be a possibility.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.775
Totally.

00:44:32.858 --> 00:44:35.569
Should we brainstorm
what you can do from now on?

00:44:36.153 --> 00:44:37.571
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:44:45.454 --> 00:44:47.372
Let's link our arms and drink!

00:44:47.456 --> 00:44:48.332
Let's link…

00:44:52.169 --> 00:44:53.212
Ha-yeong!

00:44:53.295 --> 00:44:56.465
You should just be my younger sister.

00:44:56.548 --> 00:44:58.342
Really? I'd love that!

00:44:58.425 --> 00:45:01.053
I've always wanted an older sister.

00:45:01.136 --> 00:45:04.389
-My younger sister!
-My older sister!

00:45:04.473 --> 00:45:09.728
Hold on, giving allowances
to my younger sister is my thing.

00:45:10.312 --> 00:45:11.146
Let's see here.

00:45:12.731 --> 00:45:16.944
One, two, three, four…

00:45:17.027 --> 00:45:19.988
You don't need to.
I know about your financial struggles.

00:45:20.072 --> 00:45:23.075
What are you talking about?
Take it. It's fine.

00:45:23.158 --> 00:45:25.869
-I won't take no for an answer.
-You're the best!

00:45:25.953 --> 00:45:28.247
You're so cute!

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:30.582
Starting today,

00:45:30.666 --> 00:45:34.419
-I'll be Go Ha-yeong.
-No, I'll be Yu Da-rim.

00:45:34.503 --> 00:45:37.214
-Those two are okay, right?
-Yu Da-rim!

00:45:38.006 --> 00:45:38.882
I hope so.

00:45:40.592 --> 00:45:41.843
I didn't expect Ms. Yu to be like this.

00:45:41.927 --> 00:45:44.680
Look at you so worried about me.

00:45:44.763 --> 00:45:46.306
-No, Ms. Yu, I…
-Why did you drink so much?

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:51.770
-I'm in such a good mood today.
-Yes, Mr. Kim!

00:45:52.312 --> 00:45:54.189
I know you should be in bed. I'm sorry.

00:45:54.731 --> 00:45:56.733
I'm sorry.

00:46:03.657 --> 00:46:05.742
This is what boyfriends are for.

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:09.913
Ha-yeong!

00:46:09.997 --> 00:46:13.792
-Hey, I was going to say earlier…
-Da-rim, the second round is on me.

00:46:13.875 --> 00:46:15.544
I'm rich.

00:46:15.627 --> 00:46:17.588
What in the world is going on?
They reek of alcohol.

00:46:17.671 --> 00:46:19.256
-Mom!
-Please.

00:46:19.339 --> 00:46:20.549
Oh my goodness, Ha-yeong too.

00:46:21.341 --> 00:46:22.426
What's going on?

00:46:22.509 --> 00:46:24.386
-Mom!
-Da-rim.

00:46:26.597 --> 00:46:27.806
My sister.

00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:29.850
My little sister.

00:46:29.933 --> 00:46:32.227
-Da-rim.
-You're okay.

00:46:36.398 --> 00:46:37.608
You're okay…

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:39.276
Let's go.

00:46:39.359 --> 00:46:40.193
All right.

00:46:40.861 --> 00:46:41.945
Mr. Gong.

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:47.868
Da-rim told me

00:46:49.286 --> 00:46:50.871
that you two are dating.

00:46:53.081 --> 00:46:53.915
That's right.

00:46:56.335 --> 00:46:58.837
I hope you don't take this the wrong way,

00:47:00.088 --> 00:47:00.964
but you still

00:47:01.715 --> 00:47:04.551
have no idea how truly great
a person Da-rim is.

00:47:06.053 --> 00:47:09.097
She'll do anything and everything
for the people she cares about

00:47:09.681 --> 00:47:10.932
and trusts them until the end.

00:47:11.516 --> 00:47:13.018
That's the reason she's been hurt a lot

00:47:13.101 --> 00:47:14.519
and holds onto a lot of pain.

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:18.940
But she doesn't show it like a fool.

00:47:23.487 --> 00:47:25.781
I won't just stand by if you make her cry.

00:47:29.409 --> 00:47:30.911
She's my family.

00:47:33.497 --> 00:47:34.456
Please be good to her.

00:47:35.999 --> 00:47:36.917
Please.

00:47:40.879 --> 00:47:42.547
I hear you,

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:44.049
but I want you to know

00:47:45.842 --> 00:47:47.260
that I like Da-rim

00:47:48.929 --> 00:47:50.764
more than you think I do.

00:47:53.225 --> 00:47:54.559
I'll never make her cry

00:47:55.811 --> 00:47:57.187
or betray her.

00:47:59.314 --> 00:48:00.565
So don't worry.

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:24.423
It's the pretty lady!

00:48:27.843 --> 00:48:28.844
Did you sleep well?

00:48:30.137 --> 00:48:32.222
How are you feeling?

00:48:32.305 --> 00:48:33.724
I'm fine, thanks to you.

00:48:33.807 --> 00:48:35.016
Hold on.

00:48:38.645 --> 00:48:40.188
Da-rim's inside, right?

00:48:40.272 --> 00:48:41.982
Let's go.

00:48:42.065 --> 00:48:44.276
She's passed out.
Do you need her for something?

00:48:44.359 --> 00:48:45.777
I have a morning appointment,

00:48:45.861 --> 00:48:47.237
so I wanted to ask her
to take him to daycare.

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:48.238
I can do it.

00:48:48.321 --> 00:48:52.033
Da-rim's going to need
at least three more days to sober up.

00:48:52.117 --> 00:48:53.034
Let's go, Jun.

00:48:58.749 --> 00:48:59.833
Why are you smiling?

00:48:59.916 --> 00:49:01.960
Because I'm going to daycare
with the pretty lady.

00:49:03.211 --> 00:49:06.173
You're so smart, unlike your dad.

00:49:06.256 --> 00:49:08.216
Which kindergarten did you go to?

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:11.386
I never went to kindergarten or daycare.

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:12.679
My teachers came to my house.

00:49:13.263 --> 00:49:14.973
Then when did you play with your friends?

00:49:15.056 --> 00:49:17.517
I don't have friends.
I don't know how to make them either.

00:49:18.769 --> 00:49:21.271
I guess this is why
early education is essential.

00:49:21.354 --> 00:49:22.898
Then should I become your friend?

00:49:23.815 --> 00:49:25.400
When someone asks you
who your best friend is,

00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:27.986
tell them it's me.

00:49:32.824 --> 00:49:33.700
Really?

00:49:33.784 --> 00:49:35.619
Thank you, Jun.

00:49:36.411 --> 00:49:38.789
Maybe I should join you at daycare.

00:49:38.872 --> 00:49:39.790
Is it fun?

00:49:41.666 --> 00:49:44.336
Preparing for the talent show
is fun and all, but…

00:49:44.419 --> 00:49:45.253
But?

00:49:45.837 --> 00:49:47.881
All the other kids
will have their moms there,

00:49:47.964 --> 00:49:49.591
but I won't, and it doesn't feel good.

00:49:50.258 --> 00:49:51.676
When's the talent show?

00:49:58.475 --> 00:50:00.185
Good morning.

00:50:00.769 --> 00:50:02.729
Hey there.

00:50:02.813 --> 00:50:04.022
Nan-suk.

00:50:04.105 --> 00:50:07.609
Why is your face so puffy?
Did someone hit you?

00:50:07.692 --> 00:50:10.445
I had some instant noodles
and soju last night.

00:50:10.529 --> 00:50:13.698
Customer service is no joke.

00:50:13.782 --> 00:50:14.991
I'm burning up inside. Look at yourself.

00:50:15.075 --> 00:50:17.619
It looks like you had a couple of bottles.

00:50:17.702 --> 00:50:21.081
Oh, I also had a drink or two.

00:50:27.295 --> 00:50:28.463
Hey, Go-eun.

00:50:29.506 --> 00:50:31.299
She's completely out of it.

00:50:31.383 --> 00:50:32.384
Are you okay?

00:50:32.467 --> 00:50:33.718
I'm fine.

00:50:35.011 --> 00:50:36.471
It is what it is.

00:50:36.555 --> 00:50:38.473
What can we do?

00:50:41.434 --> 00:50:42.727
Everybody, good morning.

00:50:46.773 --> 00:50:48.567
You're chipper this morning.

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:50.777
I know, right? Was your husband
extra nice to you or something?

00:50:50.861 --> 00:50:52.153
No, as if.

00:50:52.237 --> 00:50:53.780
I was professionally treated.

00:50:54.948 --> 00:50:56.241
You went to see a doctor?

00:50:56.324 --> 00:50:57.576
No, retail therapy.

00:50:57.659 --> 00:51:01.413
Shopping is the best cure for stress.
Look at this.

00:51:01.496 --> 00:51:02.330
This is expensive.

00:51:02.414 --> 00:51:03.623
Doesn't it look luxurious?

00:51:04.666 --> 00:51:06.126
-Good for you.
-Well done.

00:51:06.209 --> 00:51:07.335
KINDNESS, DEDICATION

00:51:07.419 --> 00:51:10.005
I see. Yes, of course.

00:51:10.088 --> 00:51:11.756
So you're saying

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:14.050
you discovered a foreign substance
inside the diaper, correct?

00:51:14.551 --> 00:51:15.468
I see.

00:51:16.261 --> 00:51:18.763
All right. I submitted the complaint.

00:51:18.847 --> 00:51:20.974
It wasn't just "a foreign substance."
It was a chicken bone.

00:51:21.057 --> 00:51:22.309
Don't you hear me?

00:51:22.392 --> 00:51:23.852
Did you not look at the photo?

00:51:24.477 --> 00:51:27.063
I did look at it,

00:51:28.231 --> 00:51:33.194
but something that big
would've caused our machinery to stop.

00:51:33.278 --> 00:51:35.322
I'd say it's close to impossible

00:51:35.405 --> 00:51:37.824
for something like that
to be missed during production.

00:51:37.908 --> 00:51:39.910
Are you saying I'm lying right now?

00:51:39.993 --> 00:51:41.828
No, ma'am. Not at all.

00:51:41.912 --> 00:51:44.080
There could've been some sort of mishap.

00:51:44.164 --> 00:51:45.582
-So how about--
-Forget it!

00:51:45.665 --> 00:51:47.125
I want 100 million won in compensation.

00:51:47.918 --> 00:51:50.795
The baby woke up again because of you!
It took forever for me to put it to sleep!

00:51:50.879 --> 00:51:52.881
Take responsibility!

00:51:52.964 --> 00:51:54.507
Yes, ma'am.

00:51:54.591 --> 00:51:58.386
We'll first have someone visit you
and check the product in question.

00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:59.846
Enough with the checking!

00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:02.432
Are you looking down on me
because I'm a mom?

00:52:02.515 --> 00:52:03.350
Just wait and see.

00:52:03.433 --> 00:52:04.851
I won't let this slide!

00:52:04.935 --> 00:52:06.102
No, I--

00:52:06.186 --> 00:52:07.479
Hello?

00:52:16.863 --> 00:52:17.781
Ms. Gong!

00:52:17.864 --> 00:52:19.658
Ms. Gong, there's an emergency.

00:52:19.741 --> 00:52:21.534
Please take a look at this.

00:52:22.327 --> 00:52:23.453
What now?

00:52:24.204 --> 00:52:26.081
A CHICKEN BONE IN A DIAPER
IGNORED BY NB CS "BECAUSE I'M A MOM"

00:52:26.164 --> 00:52:27.123
What is this?

00:52:27.207 --> 00:52:28.333
Chicken bone?

00:52:28.416 --> 00:52:29.834
Chicken bone is one thing,

00:52:29.918 --> 00:52:32.087
but this is the bigger issue.

00:52:36.174 --> 00:52:37.968
You should at least send someone to check.

00:52:38.551 --> 00:52:42.931
Our policy wouldn't permit compensation
because it was a mishap on your end.

00:52:43.014 --> 00:52:45.392
Are you saying I'm lying?

00:52:45.475 --> 00:52:48.395
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.

00:52:48.979 --> 00:52:52.065
Are you looking down on me
because I'm a mom?

00:52:52.148 --> 00:52:53.692
Probably.

00:52:54.234 --> 00:52:55.902
What the hell? Who is this?

00:52:55.986 --> 00:52:57.112
Well,

00:52:57.195 --> 00:52:59.072
it sounds like Go Da-rim,

00:52:59.155 --> 00:53:01.491
so I checked
the original recording of the call.

00:53:01.574 --> 00:53:03.034
This audio is fake.

00:53:03.118 --> 00:53:05.745
I think she manipulated it
with a deepfake or whatever.

00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:06.663
Manipulated?

00:53:06.746 --> 00:53:09.499
Yes. I'll have it removed immediately
for spreading false information

00:53:09.582 --> 00:53:11.459
and issue a statement.

00:53:11.543 --> 00:53:12.419
Go ahead.

00:53:14.879 --> 00:53:15.714
Wait.

00:53:16.756 --> 00:53:18.508
Did you say that was Go Da-rim's voice?

00:53:18.591 --> 00:53:19.718
Yes.

00:53:19.801 --> 00:53:22.053
-Delete the original recording.
-Pardon?

00:53:22.679 --> 00:53:24.305
Delete the file.

00:53:27.183 --> 00:53:28.601
Hello, Producer.

00:53:29.185 --> 00:53:30.395
Have you been well?

00:53:32.105 --> 00:53:34.024
-Boycott it!
-Chicken bone diaper!

00:53:34.107 --> 00:53:38.319
The CS representative's remarks have
sparked public outrage among consumers,

00:53:38.403 --> 00:53:39.696
and mom communities are now spreading

00:53:39.779 --> 00:53:42.615
-a boycott movement against Natural BeBe.
-A foreign substance was discovered.

00:53:42.699 --> 00:53:44.659
-Unapologetic corporate bully!
-It was none other than a chicken bone.

00:53:44.743 --> 00:53:47.162
-Boycott it!
-The CS representative must be insane.

00:53:47.245 --> 00:53:48.830
Apologize for that unacceptable service!

00:53:48.913 --> 00:53:50.040
-Apologize!
-Guys!

00:53:50.123 --> 00:53:52.542
-Excuse me.
-A diaper from a major company…

00:53:52.625 --> 00:53:56.254
Please don't do this.
There's been a misunderstanding.

00:53:56.838 --> 00:53:57.756
What misunderstanding?

00:53:57.839 --> 00:54:00.508
The chicken bone or that insane employee?

00:54:01.092 --> 00:54:02.635
The chicken bone hasn't been confirmed,

00:54:02.719 --> 00:54:04.596
and I never said any of those things.

00:54:04.679 --> 00:54:05.638
Hold on.

00:54:06.222 --> 00:54:07.891
Are you that crazy bitch?

00:54:07.974 --> 00:54:09.267
Yeah, that's her voice!

00:54:09.350 --> 00:54:11.603
-Everyone, that's her.
-She has the face of a snake.

00:54:11.686 --> 00:54:13.313
What misunderstanding?
We heard the recording.

00:54:13.396 --> 00:54:14.439
No, that's not--

00:54:14.522 --> 00:54:15.940
You still haven't come to your senses!

00:54:19.486 --> 00:54:20.487
Get a grip!

00:54:20.570 --> 00:54:21.738
Get a grip!

00:54:21.821 --> 00:54:23.782
Don't try to feed us that nonsense.

00:54:23.865 --> 00:54:26.117
Are you serious right now?

00:54:26.868 --> 00:54:27.911
Take this!

00:54:27.994 --> 00:54:31.122
-How dare you?
-You piece of trash!

00:54:38.171 --> 00:54:39.422
A chicken bone in a diaper?

00:54:39.506 --> 00:54:42.258
I'm so pissed off right now.

00:54:42.342 --> 00:54:45.095
Are we going to let them get away with it?

00:54:45.178 --> 00:54:46.346
Come on out!

00:54:46.429 --> 00:54:49.349
We need to tear this place down!

00:55:08.701 --> 00:55:09.702
Are you okay?

00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:11.621
Let's go.

00:55:12.497 --> 00:55:13.498
Please move.

00:55:13.581 --> 00:55:14.415
Make way.

00:55:14.916 --> 00:55:16.042
Move.

00:55:32.308 --> 00:55:35.019
My goodness. Is that your doing?

00:55:36.646 --> 00:55:38.148
I thought I'd escalate it a bit.

00:55:38.231 --> 00:55:40.942
An affair with the troublemaker
who's tarnishing the company's image.

00:55:42.402 --> 00:55:43.278
That should be enough

00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:45.780
to get rid of Gong Ji-hyeok.

00:55:46.364 --> 00:55:47.240
Yeah.

00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:49.117
I confirmed that they're dating.

00:55:51.161 --> 00:55:52.495
Like father, like son.

00:55:53.288 --> 00:55:54.622
Even affairs run in the family.

00:55:54.706 --> 00:55:55.832
This should be enough

00:55:56.332 --> 00:55:58.168
to get rid of him once and for all.

00:55:58.251 --> 00:55:59.085
Before that,

00:56:00.295 --> 00:56:01.129
take a look at this.

00:56:01.963 --> 00:56:02.881
What's this?

00:56:04.924 --> 00:56:06.509
My goodness.

00:56:08.553 --> 00:56:09.679
Look at you.

00:56:09.762 --> 00:56:11.598
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

00:56:12.265 --> 00:56:13.892
You just bought that coat.

00:56:14.559 --> 00:56:16.603
Forget it. Who cares about that?

00:56:16.686 --> 00:56:20.440
Why are they causing such a ruckus
when they don't even know the whole story?

00:56:20.523 --> 00:56:21.441
I know.

00:56:21.524 --> 00:56:23.193
We live in a scary world.

00:56:23.276 --> 00:56:25.945
I submitted requests for the post to be
taken down, but it keeps getting reposted.

00:56:26.446 --> 00:56:28.615
It feels like someone's
deliberately spreading it.

00:56:30.033 --> 00:56:31.576
I can't believe this.

00:56:34.329 --> 00:56:35.496
You're here.

00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:00.396
I…

00:57:12.825 --> 00:57:14.244
Are you hurt?

00:57:14.327 --> 00:57:17.622
Everyone guarded me, so I'm fine.

00:57:23.169 --> 00:57:25.380
-We'll take immediate legal action.
-No.

00:57:25.463 --> 00:57:26.756
I want to go

00:57:27.757 --> 00:57:29.968
and talk to her in person.

00:57:30.051 --> 00:57:31.302
Who knows what she'll do to you?

00:57:31.886 --> 00:57:32.845
Don't do anything.

00:57:33.555 --> 00:57:34.389
I'll handle it.

00:57:34.973 --> 00:57:36.266
She's my customer.

00:57:37.725 --> 00:57:39.811
As a member of the Mother TF Team,

00:57:40.436 --> 00:57:42.188
I have to solve my own problems.

00:57:43.231 --> 00:57:46.025
That's taking responsibility.

00:57:50.363 --> 00:57:51.489
Then I'll come with you.

00:57:52.907 --> 00:57:53.783
Okay.

00:57:56.828 --> 00:57:57.704
This is it.

00:58:08.339 --> 00:58:09.424
Can I help you?

00:58:11.175 --> 00:58:13.720
Are you Ms. Lee So-yeong?

00:58:13.803 --> 00:58:15.555
Yes. Who are you?

00:58:15.638 --> 00:58:19.642
Oh, hello. I'm Go Da-rim,
an employee of Natural BeBe.

00:58:20.268 --> 00:58:21.394
We just came by

00:58:21.477 --> 00:58:25.273
because we wanted to ask you
about the complaint you made.

00:58:25.356 --> 00:58:26.774
How did you know where I live?

00:58:26.858 --> 00:58:28.526
Did you leak my personal information?

00:58:29.694 --> 00:58:32.280
It'd be a leak if we provided it
to a third party without your permission.

00:58:32.363 --> 00:58:36.826
We lawfully used your personal information
for business purposes.

00:58:36.909 --> 00:58:38.077
That doesn't matter!

00:58:39.203 --> 00:58:40.496
You showed up unannounced.

00:58:41.456 --> 00:58:44.917
-You kept ignoring our calls--
-Leave right now.

00:58:45.543 --> 00:58:47.211
Or I'll report you for stalking.

00:58:49.422 --> 00:58:51.674
Ma'am, just a moment.

00:58:53.676 --> 00:58:54.802
Ma'am, wait.

00:58:54.886 --> 00:58:56.471
Please talk to us.

00:58:56.554 --> 00:58:58.723
Avoiding us and the issue
isn't going to solve anything.

00:59:00.516 --> 00:59:01.684
What issue?

00:59:02.268 --> 00:59:03.227
What do you want?

00:59:03.311 --> 00:59:05.355
Do you know how much trouble
you've caused us?

00:59:05.438 --> 00:59:06.397
Do I need to know?

00:59:07.065 --> 00:59:10.151
That company has never once listened
to my troubles!

00:59:11.694 --> 00:59:13.154
Please calm down.

00:59:13.237 --> 00:59:14.656
Why don't we talk inside?

00:59:25.833 --> 00:59:27.543
Oh no! Ye-eun!

00:59:28.544 --> 00:59:29.629
Ye-eun!

00:59:52.402 --> 00:59:53.653
The baby.

00:59:54.278 --> 00:59:55.655
Ye-eun!

00:59:56.155 --> 00:59:57.699
Oh no!

00:59:58.908 --> 00:59:59.826
Is she okay?

00:59:59.909 --> 01:00:01.119
I'm so sorry.

01:00:02.662 --> 01:00:04.872
Mommy's so sorry.

01:00:09.293 --> 01:00:10.461
I'm so sorry.

01:00:18.845 --> 01:00:20.471
Let's just get you admitted.

01:00:20.555 --> 01:00:23.307
They said it was just a scratch.

01:00:23.391 --> 01:00:24.809
It's nothing serious.

01:00:24.892 --> 01:00:27.478
Do you know how many times
my heart dropped today?

01:00:27.562 --> 01:00:29.439
Look at it. I'm fine.

01:00:29.522 --> 01:00:30.898
What are we going to do about your wrist?

01:00:30.982 --> 01:00:33.276
What do you mean? It's fine.

01:00:33.359 --> 01:00:34.277
Excuse me.

01:00:37.405 --> 01:00:38.448
Are you okay?

01:00:39.031 --> 01:00:40.533
Yes, I'm fine.

01:00:40.616 --> 01:00:42.201
Is Ye-eun okay?

01:00:42.744 --> 01:00:44.996
Yes, they said she was fine.

01:00:45.079 --> 01:00:46.247
Thank goodness.

01:00:48.458 --> 01:00:49.667
I'm sorry.

01:00:50.918 --> 01:00:52.920
It's okay. No one got hurt.

01:00:53.004 --> 01:00:54.172
Why are you crying?

01:00:54.255 --> 01:00:55.423
I'm sorry.

01:00:55.506 --> 01:00:56.674
My goodness.

01:00:58.050 --> 01:00:59.093
I'm sorry.

01:01:03.055 --> 01:01:04.015
I MANIPULATED THE NATURAL BEBE CONTROVERSY

01:01:04.098 --> 01:01:06.267
I'm the person who posted
about the chicken bone incident

01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:07.810
in Natural BeBe's diaper.

01:01:08.644 --> 01:01:11.063
I'd like to confess
that I made all of it up

01:01:11.147 --> 01:01:12.648
and offer my sincerest apologies.

01:01:13.524 --> 01:01:15.985
I've been dealing
with some personal issues recently,

01:01:16.068 --> 01:01:19.655
and I ended up taking it out
on an innocent employee at Natural BeBe.

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:22.241
Despite all that,

01:01:22.325 --> 01:01:25.036
the CS representative
threw herself to save my baby

01:01:25.119 --> 01:01:26.871
and was injured in the process.

01:01:28.039 --> 01:01:31.375
I don't have the words to describe
how sorry and thankful I am.

01:01:32.335 --> 01:01:34.629
To prove her innocence,

01:01:34.712 --> 01:01:37.089
I've attached
the original recording of the call.

01:01:54.774 --> 01:01:55.858
All right.

01:01:55.942 --> 01:01:58.653
The media outlets
have agreed to issue corrections.

01:01:58.736 --> 01:01:59.862
What about the rest?

01:01:59.946 --> 01:02:02.698
We've uploaded an announcement
along with the original call recording.

01:02:02.782 --> 01:02:06.285
We've released our official statement
on social media and online communities.

01:02:06.369 --> 01:02:08.412
I've contacted
all the online mom communities as well,

01:02:08.496 --> 01:02:10.665
and they've agreed to take down
all defamatory posts.

01:02:10.748 --> 01:02:11.958
Yeah!

01:02:12.041 --> 01:02:12.959
Well done, everyone.

01:02:13.793 --> 01:02:15.419
-Good job, everyone!
-We're done.

01:02:15.503 --> 01:02:17.463
-It's over now, Da-rim.
-Team dinner tonight?

01:02:18.548 --> 01:02:19.382
How about a refreshing beer?

01:02:19.465 --> 01:02:21.259
-That sounds so nice.
-Well done.

01:02:21.342 --> 01:02:22.343
What should we eat?

01:02:22.885 --> 01:02:24.095
-Grilled intestines.
-I don't know.

01:02:24.178 --> 01:02:25.263
Ms. Go Da-rim.

01:02:27.139 --> 01:02:29.267
How's your injury?

01:02:29.892 --> 01:02:31.477
It's healing.

01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:33.145
Is that so?

01:02:52.123 --> 01:02:53.708
CERTIFICATE OF MARRIAGE STATUS

01:02:55.459 --> 01:02:57.461
NAME: GO DA-RIM
STATUS: UNMARRIED

01:03:04.802 --> 01:03:06.721
NAME: GO DA-RIM
STATUS: UNMARRIED

01:03:20.902 --> 01:03:25.823
DYNAMITE KISS

01:03:56.437 --> 01:03:57.730
You were right.

01:03:57.813 --> 01:04:00.483
Ji-hyeok knows Go Da-rim is single.

01:04:00.566 --> 01:04:02.985
If I didn't lie to get hired,

01:04:03.069 --> 01:04:04.070
I'm sure

01:04:04.862 --> 01:04:08.366
someone more qualified
would've gotten my spot.

01:04:08.449 --> 01:04:10.618
I don't think I can continue working here.

01:04:11.202 --> 01:04:12.370
I'm sorry.

01:04:12.453 --> 01:04:13.871
How did you know about this?

01:04:13.955 --> 01:04:16.207
Jun and I decided to become best friends.

01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:18.084
Please don't give false hope to Jun.

01:04:18.167 --> 01:04:20.670
I have no interest in you as a woman.

01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:24.840
You basically made our team.

01:04:26.342 --> 01:04:27.468
Stop running away now.

01:04:28.761 --> 01:04:29.679
I won't ever let you go.

01:04:32.807 --> 01:04:37.895
