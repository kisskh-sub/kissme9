[Previously]
Will you be my boyfriend?

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.760
Okay. Let's date.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.520
If anything like that happens again, you have to tell me immediately.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.980
I understand how you feel.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.520
If something bad ever happened
to my own dear brother,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.430
I'd feel the same way.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.870
We grew up together, Than.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.910
Do you really think Dad
would accept it if he found out?

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.590
Because what I'm going to do is keep on loving you.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.390
Because I don't know

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.490
if I could ever love anyone else if it's not you.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.541
I know you've been investigating
the concession rights and the mermaid hunters.

00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:40.980
Drop it.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.210
Why?

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.900
I will handle this myself.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.470
You getting involved when you don't fully
understand the situation

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.310
will only cause problems for me.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.870
It's just that since I moved here,

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.300
I've never seen Nava work
on a full moon day. Not once.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.560
I just saw another merperson swimming that way.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.910
Should we go take a look? I want to know who it is.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.950
If we hadn't met in the water,
we never would have known.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.220
I had a feeling the first time I met you, Ping,

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.420
I'm half-human.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.040
My parents fell in love...

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.380
My mom didn't know my dad was a merman.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.470
Are you staying here tonight?

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.900
I'm just keeping my promise.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.540
[Phraphai]

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.740
It's not just a near miss.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.350
I think I'm on a direct collision course
with you.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.100
We've had a lot more customers this past month.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.040
I think we should increase our alcohol stock.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.080
We're running out fast.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.180
Yeah, sure.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.280
I'll talk to the mainland supplier myself.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.840
What do you think about food supplies?

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.000
We should increase those, too.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.190
But check the ingredient prices carefully,

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:54.560
or we'll end up taking a loss.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.910
Yeah, I'll take care of that at the market.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.160
Let's stick to the plan then.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.460
Okay, I'll get going.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.960
Yeah.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.850
Do you want some orange cake? Aunt Son said it's your favorite.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.480
No, thanks.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.090
I heard you're going to restock the bar today.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.090
Want me to come help?

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.020
That's okay. I can handle it.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.770
Are you okay, Phana?

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.160
What do you mean?

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.990
It's just... the past few days,

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.920
you don't seem like you want to talk to me.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.130
Did I do something to upset you?

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:53.830
Ping,

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.010
I think we should keep
some distance for a while.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.680
I feel like we've gotten too close.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.850
I'm worried about what people might think.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.820
Who would think badly of us?

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.720
You and Nava are close too, right? Like siblings.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.490
Nava and I grew up together.

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.300
But you...

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.930
you're my employee, and I'm your boss.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.700
I don't understand.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.800
Bosses and employees aren't usually this close.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.980
I don't treat anyone else specially,

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.650
so why should I make an exception for you?

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:35.000
So you did think I was special?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.557
No. I never thought that.

00:09:38.557 --> 00:09:43.227
The reason we got so close was because I had just broken up with Namhom.

00:09:43.227 --> 00:09:45.527
I was lonely. That's all.

00:09:47.897 --> 00:09:50.477
Then let me ask you directly.

00:09:51.427 --> 00:09:53.877
How do you feel about me, Phana?

00:09:55.347 --> 00:09:57.847
I don't know.

00:09:57.847 --> 00:10:00.087
How do you feel about me?

00:10:01.067 --> 00:10:05.897
For me you're more than just my boss.

00:10:09.137 --> 00:10:14.387
But I'm sorry for crossing the line.

00:11:02.677 --> 00:11:05.117
Hey, what's wrong with you, Phana?

00:11:05.117 --> 00:11:06.977
Nothing.

00:11:06.977 --> 00:11:09.027
I'm just spacing out.

00:11:11.317 --> 00:11:14.397
This is about Ping, isn't it?

00:11:19.127 --> 00:11:23.577
I talked to him about us keeping our distance.

00:11:25.357 --> 00:11:31.277
But I don't know if I did the right thing by telling him that.

00:11:32.097 --> 00:11:36.337
Didn't you tell me you wanted to figure out your own feelings first?

00:11:37.177 --> 00:11:39.127
Yeah.

00:11:39.127 --> 00:11:43.377
But I still don't know how I feel.

00:11:44.397 --> 00:11:49.457
All I know is... Ping has already developed feelings.

00:11:51.617 --> 00:11:56.307
And I know I ended up hurting him.

00:11:58.537 --> 00:12:01.307
But the worst part is,

00:12:01.307 --> 00:12:05.627
I don't even know how I really feel about him.

00:12:06.937 --> 00:12:13.317
Or if maybe, like you said, I was just using him to replace Namhom.

00:12:15.207 --> 00:12:20.277
Maybe I don't really want Ping after all.

00:12:31.457 --> 00:12:34.327
It's not wrong for you
to feel that way right now.

00:12:35.247 --> 00:12:39.967
But I think you should give yourself a little more time.

00:12:39.967 --> 00:12:45.047
Once you're sure about your feelings, then you can decide what to do.

00:12:47.577 --> 00:12:49.877
Yeah, you're probably right.

00:12:49.877 --> 00:12:52.547
I really haven't figured it out yet.

00:13:00.607 --> 00:13:03.017
Phurich, I'm running a fever all of a sudden.

00:13:03.017 --> 00:13:05.037
I have to go home early.

00:13:05.037 --> 00:13:06.837
Is something wrong?

00:13:42.237 --> 00:13:44.337
I'm home, Mom.

00:13:49.687 --> 00:13:52.377
I brought you some desserts.

00:13:55.437 --> 00:13:58.727
I'll leave them in the kitchen, okay?

00:14:09.337 --> 00:14:13.027
Aren't you supposed to be at your internship?
Why are you back?

00:14:29.877 --> 00:14:31.997
Don't tell me... they found out, did they?

00:14:31.997 --> 00:14:34.317
That you're a monster.

00:14:47.647 --> 00:14:50.127
If everyone finds out what you really are,

00:14:50.127 --> 00:14:52.717
what am I supposed to tell them?
That my son's a freak?

00:14:52.717 --> 00:14:54.997
But Ping is our child.

00:14:54.997 --> 00:14:58.407
If I had a choice,
I wouldn't want a child like this!

00:15:08.357 --> 00:15:12.167
Phana, I need to take one more sick day.

00:15:12.167 --> 00:15:14.607
I already texted Phurich,

00:15:14.607 --> 00:15:16.307
but he's on the mainland,

00:15:16.307 --> 00:15:19.897
so he told me to let you know myself.

00:15:19.897 --> 00:15:22.077
Have you taken any medicine?

00:15:27.757 --> 00:15:29.547
Phana, are you okay?

00:15:29.547 --> 00:15:31.817
You look stressed.

00:15:31.817 --> 00:15:37.157
Oh, Ping just texted.
He's taking another sick day.

00:15:37.157 --> 00:15:40.477
Is everything okay between you and Ping?

00:15:41.317 --> 00:15:43.707
Why? Did you hear something?

00:15:43.707 --> 00:15:46.467
I can tell just by looking at your face.

00:15:49.637 --> 00:15:54.137
It's nothing serious.

00:15:54.137 --> 00:15:58.217
I'm just not really sure
about my own feelings.

00:15:59.517 --> 00:16:04.827
I don't know what's going on between you and Ping right now,

00:16:05.887 --> 00:16:09.987
but I don't want to see you looking all sad and lonely like this.

00:16:12.917 --> 00:16:15.707
If there's anything I can do to help,

00:16:15.707 --> 00:16:17.607
please let me know.

00:16:18.647 --> 00:16:20.347
Thanks.

00:16:25.737 --> 00:16:27.367
Hello, Phana.

00:16:27.367 --> 00:16:29.237
Oh, Phraphai.

00:16:29.237 --> 00:16:32.147
What brings you all the way
out to the bar today?

00:16:32.147 --> 00:16:35.677
I have something I need to discuss
with you and Nava.

00:16:37.567 --> 00:16:39.687
You sound serious.

00:16:39.687 --> 00:16:41.387
A little, yes.

00:16:41.387 --> 00:16:43.287
Alright, I'll get straight to the point.

00:16:43.287 --> 00:16:46.687
You've heard about
the merman sea concession, right?

00:16:46.687 --> 00:16:48.777
Yeah, I've heard a little about it.

00:16:48.777 --> 00:16:52.077
Humans have started hunting merfolk
on the island.

00:16:52.077 --> 00:16:54.297
Several have been kidnapped...

00:16:54.297 --> 00:16:56.767
some have even been killed.

00:16:56.767 --> 00:16:59.197
My father and I are investigating it,

00:16:59.197 --> 00:17:01.787
and we suspect it might be connected

00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:05.107
to humans encroaching on merman territory.

00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:07.117
So you're saying...

00:17:07.117 --> 00:17:10.507
what happened 20 years ago could be happening all over again?

00:17:10.507 --> 00:17:11.597
Possibly.

00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:13.847
I can't say for sure yet.

00:17:13.847 --> 00:17:16.557
We don't have enough evidence.

00:17:16.557 --> 00:17:21.077
But this situation has already made all the merfolk on the island terrified.

00:17:21.077 --> 00:17:24.990
When this happens, I don't feel safe at all.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.930
Especially for Nava.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.670
Phana, that's why I came to talk to you.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:37.250
From now on, I'll be personally responsible for Nava's safety.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.570
My safety? What do you mean, Phraphai?

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:47.990
Nava, from now on, I'll take you to and from work.

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:51.690
If you need to go anywhere, you tell me.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:55.740
And at night, I'll have Met watch over you.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:03.680
Why does it sound like you're putting me on probation?

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.840
Nava, please understand.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:11.960
I'm only doing this for your safety.

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.460
Don't forget,

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:20.200
the one who suffered the most
from what happened 20 years ago was you.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.630
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you again.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.810
But...

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:29.690
I think you should do as Phraphai says.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:32.700
I don't want to see you get hurt again.

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.550
Please take good care of him, Phraphai.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.260
Of course.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.990
In that case, I'll come by tonight
to pick you up.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.760
Nava,

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:51.340
I'm really worried about you.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.340
I'll be going now.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.780
I'll be going then, Phana.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.290
Nava,

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:21.040
I want to ask you something directly about Phurich.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.033
Please be honest.

00:19:26.033 --> 00:19:30.430
What is your relationship with him right now?

00:19:32.616 --> 00:19:35.316
We're dating.

00:19:36.293 --> 00:19:39.263
I know perfectly well that our kind
shouldn't get involved with humans.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:44.360
Especially when it comes to love. It's forbidden.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.860
But as...

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:54.860
as a being with a heart, just like them,

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:58.990
I'm asking to follow my own heart.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.840
I understand, Nava.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:08.000
But I still want you to listen to what Phraphai and I are saying.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.270
At the very least, I want you to do as Phraphai says for now.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:17.240
Just until we're sure that you're really safe.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.840
Okay?

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.840
Nava, let's go home.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.970
Uh... Phurich.

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.600
- I...
- Nava.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.880
I'm here to pick you up.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.450
What does that mean?

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:47.970
It's a personal matter.

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:50.450
I don't need to explain myself to you.

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:54.610
Let's go, Nava. We're going home.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.510
What's going on, Nava?

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.260
I'm sorry.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:08.370
With everything that's happening...

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.890
I just can't explain it to you right now.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.700
But I promise,

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.220
when things get better,

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.500
I'll tell you everything myself.

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:44.990
You knew about this, didn't you?

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:48.900
Why are you doing this?

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.080
You have Phraphai picking Nava up
and dropping him off every day,

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.720
and you even have people watching his house.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.780
What's your game here?

00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.610
Trust me, Phu.

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:02.400
Phraphai and I have our reasons.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.610
What reasons?

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.320
Or are you just trying to keep
Nava and me apart?

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.870
Calm the hell down.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:11.040
Then why are you doing this?

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.980
You're acting like Nava's in danger.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.330
He is.

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:19.930
Everything we're doing is to protect him.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.600
What do you mean?

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:27.360
Who's trying to hurt him?

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:33.260
Calm down and listen to me, Phu.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:37.410
Right now, no one has done anything to Nava.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:41.070
But something might happen.

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:44.200
On this island,

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.890
there are a lot of complicated things going on,

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:51.930
and I can't explain everything
to you right now.

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:58.090
All I'm asking you to do right now

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:00.460
is trust me...

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.360
and trust Nava.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.480
That's all I ask.

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.040
Then why does it have to be Phraphai?

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:13.000
Why can't you and I protect him?

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:16.890
You're like his real brother, aren't you?

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:19.199
Oh, Phu…

00:23:19.199 --> 00:23:21.779
I don't know how to explain this to you.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.730
Hello, Phana.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:06.110
How are you feeling?

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.210
Still not much better.

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:10.930
Do you need anything?

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:13.360
I can have Lek bring it to the resort for you.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.460
I came home two or three days ago.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.460
I'm not at the resort.

00:24:21.942 --> 00:24:25.162
You're not trying to avoid me, are you?

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:31.630
If I said yes...

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:34.270
that I really am avoiding you...

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.180
what would you do?

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:45.160
Would you not feel anything at all?

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.160
I...

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.740
I don't know.

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:57.790
Phana, I'd like to resign.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.760
I'll take that as your acknowledgement.

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:10.740
What about your internship, Ping?

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.780
If you don't complete it,
how will you graduate?

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.620
Did you even think about yourself
when you made this decision?

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.010
Why do you care?

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:24.840
You always just say, "I don't know."

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.990
I'm just an employee to you.

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:29.450
So please, stop caring.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:31.860
Yeah, fine.

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.740
If you think this is best,
then do whatever you want.

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.300
Go wherever you want.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.520
I don't care anymore.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.730
Okay. That's all, then.

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:26.130
It's been a while.

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:28.680
Oh, Silp! Hello.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.050
Mind if I join you for a drink?

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:33.180
Of course not. Is this table okay?

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.350
- Perfect.
- Please, have a seat.

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:41.500
What can I get you to drink?

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.400
I'll have a brandy, please.

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.590
Maiek.

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:48.670
Yes?

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:50.370
A glass of brandy, please.

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:52.490
Got it.

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:59.430
So, how are you finding life on Koh Khen?

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:03.670
As far as living here, I'd say it's going well.

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:07.650
But as for understanding the place not quite.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.470
How so?

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.770
I don't know.

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:15.550
I just feel like...

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:17.420
- Here you are.
- Please, enjoy.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.480
Your brandy, sir.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.550
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:26.560
There's something strange about this place.

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:30.210
The stories, the people...

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:33.990
and so many things happen
that I don't understand.

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:41.120
It's like the people here are trying to hide something from outsiders.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:47.000
Sometimes, not knowing everything is better for you.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.280
Like I told you before, this island isn't suited for newcomers.

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:57.290
I guess you were right about that.

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:05.664
Ever since I got here, it's just been one secret after another.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.860
And then there's that merman legend.

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:14.540
Didn't you once tell me you didn't believe in the merman legend?

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.570
It's not really about believing
or not believing.

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:21.680
It's just that these stories
keep popping up in my life

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.980
to the point where I can't just
ignore them anymore.

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:29.310
In that case,

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:32.840
why don't I tell you a little story
about Koh Khen?

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:39.660
A long, long time ago,
this island had another name.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.900
It was called the Island of the Moon.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.380
It was the dwelling place of a certain species

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:47.880
that we know and call "merfolk."

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.660
Normally, they live in the water.

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:53.320
When they are in the water,

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.060
their lower bodies have tails and scales,

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.630
just like fish.

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:01.840
But whenever they come up onto dry land,

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:05.270
they look just like ordinary humans.

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:09.680
However, they have one limitation.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.410
What's that?

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:16.580
If they remain in their human form for too long,

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:21.080
marks start to appear on their bodies, similar to tattoos.

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.920
Right before the full moon.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.200
Oh?

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.910
You've heard this part
of the story before, haven't you?

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:29.840
Just a little.

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:32.320
Good.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.520
Those marks I mentioned are a warning sign.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:39.560
They mean the blood in their bodies
is becoming toxic.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:43.810
And during that time, they are forbidden from mating.

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:47.520
What they have to do is dive deep into the sea

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.690
on the night of the full moon

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:53.120
to cleanse the toxins
from their bodies using coral.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.920
If they don't,

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:58.650
they'll be trapped
in their mermaid form forever.

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:05.380
In the past, the merfolk lived here peacefully.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:09.710
Until humans began to settle on the island.

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:14.470
At first, humans and merfolk lived together in peace.

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:17.030
But as time went on,

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:19.590
humans, driven by their own greed and desire,

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:24.740
began hunting merfolk out of greed, obsession,

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.960
or whatever their reasons.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:32.210
Hundreds of merfolk were killed and lost forever.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:39.520
After that, merfolk and humans could no longer live together.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:44.570
The ones who survived banded together to fight back against the humans.

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:46.310
But in the end,

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:51.760
they decided to no longer reveal their existence to humans ever again.

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:55.700
So, does that mean

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:58.980
there are no merfolk
living among humans anymore?

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:02.640
Actually, that might not be entirely true.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:06.070
Because we just don't know who is a merman.

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:10.420
Perhaps even merfolk themselves
can't tell each other apart.

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:15.750
So, have you ever seen one?

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:18.673
As for that question...

00:31:18.673 --> 00:31:23.493
when you truly believe that merfolk exist,
I'll answer you then.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.020
Yes.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.390
Phraphai, you drink here too?

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:56.380
Oh, no. I'm here to pick up Nava.

00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:59.920
This area isn't very safe right now.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.240
Nava.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.470
You two know each other?

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:07.290
He's the son of the chief of this island.

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:09.580
There's no one here who doesn't know him.

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:14.420
Apparently, you're the only one
who doesn't know him well enough.

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:20.240
- Are you ready?
- Yes, all set.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.350
Then let's head home.

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:23.850
Okay.

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:26.140
Silp, I'll be going now.

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:27.740
Go on.

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.890
Goodbye, Phurich.

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:31.690
See you later.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.240
Let's go.

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:40.940
You and that boy...

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.850
It's not just
a boss-employee relationship, is it?

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:46.740
No.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.410
You can drop me off here.

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:56.430
Goodbye, Silp. And thank you.

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:17.400
Is something wrong?

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.070
You've been at home for three weeks now.

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:23.830
Your internship wouldn't let you
take a break for this long, would it?

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:26.740
I quit, Mom.

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:28.660
Actually...

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.270
I'm thinking of taking a leave of absence
this semester.

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:33.240
But don't worry about the tuition.

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.230
I still have some savings.

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:39.440
So, they all know now, don't they?

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:42.370
That you're a monster.

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:56.790
"Monster" this,

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.040
"monster" that.

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.840
That "monster" you keep talking about...

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.630
is your son.

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:15.530
Let me ask you something, just once.

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:20.410
Since the day I was born...

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:25.220
have you ever loved me at all?

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:34.950
So I was right all along.

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:37.710
All this time,

00:34:37.734 --> 00:34:48.456
Officail Website : kissasian.be  Translate by =Qari= @Team Viki

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.140
you've never even seen me as your son.

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:46.060
Did I have a choice?

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.520
I didn't have a choice!

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:53.580
I'm tormented every time I remember that my child isn't human!

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.300
And what about me, Mom?

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:03.860
Did I have a choice?

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:06.750
I didn't!

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.110
If you hate me this much,

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:14.600
why didn't you just kill me
and get it over with?

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.730
If I walk out of your life right now...

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:34.110
will you finally be happy?

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.150
Go wherever you want.

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:41.560
I don't want to deal with you anymore!

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.920
Nava.

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:14.310
Is your "big brother" not on guard duty today?

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:16.490
Phraphai had some business to attend to.

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:18.490
He said he'll probably be late.

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:22.560
How long do we have to keep this up?

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.830
It's been almost three weeks.

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:27.830
We're a couple, you know.

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:30.830
Don't you miss me at all?

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:35.430
Of course I miss you.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:38.400
I miss you so much.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.030
But I don't know what to do.

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.980
Can't you try to understand my situation?

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:48.880
And you?

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.500
Do you understand mine?

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.070
I know how suffocating this must be for you.

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:59.160
But I feel the same way.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.980
But you're still choosing to listen to them

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:07.450
and ignoring how we both feel?

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:15.710
I'm sorry.

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:20.020
I guess I haven't done enough for you.

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:24.590
It's not your fault.

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:27.830
It's just that I miss you so much

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:30.740
that I don't know what to do anymore.

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:36.260
We see each other every day,

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:40.400
yet it feels like we're drifting further apart.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:44.590
I'm sorry.

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:52.770
Nava.

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:57.500
Are you done?

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:02.000
Let me just take these things back inside.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.960
Alright. I'll wait here.

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.350
I know how suffocating this must feel for you.

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:04.160
But I feel the same way.

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:07.260
Then why do you keep choosing to do
what others tell you,

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.820
without caring how we feel?

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:22.010
[]

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:44.110
May 14, 2018

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.290
Mom seemed to be in a really good mood today.

00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:54.100
Probably because one of her
favorite movies was on TV.

00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:58.780
It's the first time in years
I've seen her smile.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.880
I'm so happy.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:11.530
June 29, 2020

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:15.160
I got into university! I'm so excited.

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:18.520
Pitupong.

00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:23.350
How should I tell Mom?

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:25.870
Will she be happy?

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:29.990
If she's happy, maybe she'll hug me.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.400
February 9, 2024

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:43.620
If I could make just one wish...

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:47.480
I wish I could just have
one happy dinner with Mom.

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:37.590
Nava.

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:51.800
Are you sure you're okay sneaking out at this hour?

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:54.820
If Phraphai finds out, I'm not.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:57.530
But I couldn't stand missing you anymore.

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:01.220
I want to be with you.

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:21.710
Even if I can't tell you everything right now,

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:26.280
I promise when things get better,

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.180
I'll tell you everything myself.

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:38.660
To be honest, it hurts every time I'm kept in the dark.

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:40.880
But what hurts even more...

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:46.710
is seeing you every day and barely
being able to be near you.

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:54.130
I don't want anything else...

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:55.830
just you.

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:59.620
♫ We don't have to tell the world
we're in love ♫

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:04.320
♫ We don't have to tell anyone
and make it messy ♫

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:06.700
♫ Let you be my world ♫

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:10.860
♫ Let's live in our own new world together ♫

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:14.520
♫ The world doesn't need to know
that we're together ♫

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:19.280
♫ Because none of that matters at all ♫

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.410
♫ As long as our hearts are one ♫

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:23.300
♫ As long as you are with me ♫

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:24.800
♫ As long as we love each other ♫

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.500
Phu.

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:28.590
Nava's at your house, right?

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:29.820
Come out.

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:32.270
Phraphai and I are at your door.

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.820
What's going on?

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:45.570
You have some nerve asking that.

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:47.070
Nava.

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:51.250
You're the one who told him
to run away, aren't you?

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:56.370
Phraphai, I...

00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:59.420
I came to see Phurich on my own.

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:02.340
Nava.

00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:03.890
We already talked about this, didn't we?

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:08.000
I'm only doing this to keep you safe.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.160
You know how dangerous this situation is.

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:14.880
That's right, Nava.

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:17.140
We're worried about you.

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:22.600
But I feel trapped.

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.920
I'm suffocating like this.

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:28.270
Nava, I know you feel suffocated.

00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:30.157
But I have to do this.

00:46:30.157 --> 00:46:32.159
It's for your own safety.

00:46:32.159 --> 00:46:34.516
This isn't a game, Nava.

00:46:34.516 --> 00:46:37.546
Otherwise, I wouldn't have let Phraphai
go this far.

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:42.580
I'm sorry,

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:45.000
but can someone just tell me the truth?

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.350
What is going on?

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:51.310
You're all acting like someone
is trying to kidnap him.

00:46:51.310 --> 00:46:54.320
If there's something going on,
shouldn't you just tell me?

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:57.089
Shut up. This isn't your business.

00:46:57.089 --> 00:47:01.200
Or maybe nothing is going on at all,

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.990
and you're just trying to keep us apart.

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:06.190
Is this the best you can do?

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:09.670
If this is all you've got, it's pathetic.

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:11.280
I'm losing my patience.

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.020
An outsider like you needs to get out of here. Get out!

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:15.730
- Phraphai!
- Hey!

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:17.430
Phu, calm down.

00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:23.750
Phraphai, please stop!

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:32.280
Nava, let's go home.

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:35.720
I can't let you stay with someone like him.

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:43.520
If you walk away with him right now,

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:46.520
you'll never see me again.

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.750
I've had enough of this!

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.510
Can I talk to Phraphai alone?

00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:35.020
I'm sorry, Phraphai,
for talking to you this way...

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:39.330
but I'm dating Phurich now.

00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:46.510
I've fallen in love with him.

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:53.880
I know...

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:57.240
everything you've done was for my own good,

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:02.630
but if you really care about me…

00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:06.600
please let me follow my heart.

00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:11.590
Mm.

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:14.470
Nava.

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:18.893
After hearing that...

00:49:19.488 --> 00:49:21.450
what else can I say?

00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:30.110
What I said might sound selfish,

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.420
but it's how I truly feel.

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.586
So...

00:49:40.586 --> 00:49:42.900
you're choosing to be with Phurich?

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:51.260
Yes.

00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:59.640
What about tonight, then?

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:01.940
We still have to shed our toxins together.

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:09.290
I'll go by myself tonight.

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:12.590
You don't have to worry.

00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:49.760
Thank you for understanding.

00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:53.400
Alright, we'll talk later.

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:55.960
I need to take this call.

00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.760
Sure.

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:44.660
Yes.

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:06.090
Met, get in the car.

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:08.980
Hey! Phraphai! What's going on? Wait!

00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:10.780
Phraphai!

00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:23.790
What did you say, Lek?

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:27.120
Huh?

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:29.050
Who did you say came looking for me?

00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:43.990
Dad!

00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:48.260
Dad!

00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:50.340
Dad!

00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:52.140
Dad!

00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:10.790
Who did this to you? Who?!

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:29.020
This was the humans, wasn't it?

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:32.430
I'll take care of them.

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:49.930
♫ In love ♫

00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:53.600
♫ Messy ♫

00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:57.280
♫ My world ♫

00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:00.720
♫ Our own new world together ♫

00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:04.940
♫ A pair ♫

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:09.513
♫ Matters at all ♫

00:54:09.513 --> 00:54:11.870
Mom.
[Next Episode]

00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:14.460
There's something I need to tell you, ma'am.

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.100
I'm in love with your son.

00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:21.680
There's something important I have to say.

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:22.660
From now on,

00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:24.650
Nava won't be working here anymore.

00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:27.950
And as for you, stay away from him.

00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:30.160
Or I'll crush you.

00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:33.460
I can't lose someone I love again,

00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:36.660
especially not Nava.

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:41.440
I promise I'll protect you
with everything I have.

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:44.690
From now on, I'm going to live with Phraphai.

00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:47.660
Phu, I get how you feel.

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:49.740
But you need to calm down, man.

00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:52.160
Get out of my way!

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:53.950
Phraphai!

00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:56.120
You're going to kill Nava!

00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:02.310
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:19.940
♫ The sky that seems so far away ♫

00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:24.640
♫ And the sea that seems so vast ♫

00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:29.360
♫ I just watch the waves all day
Knowing we can never meet ♫

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:35.200
♫ Our hearts that beat as one ♫

00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:39.460
♫ But the world will never listen ♫

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:44.250
♫ We're just parallel lines
waiting for a miracle ♫

00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:51.670
♫ Though the rules of this world
Forbid us from being one ♫

00:55:51.670 --> 00:56:00.050
♫ This love is about you and me
And no one else ♫

00:56:00.050 --> 00:56:03.840
♫ We don't have to tell the world
we're in love ♫

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:08.500
♫ We don't have to tell anyone
and make it messy ♫

00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:10.800
♫ Let you be my world ♫

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:15.090
♫ Let's live in our own new world together ♫

00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:18.820
♫ We don't have to tell the world
we're together ♫

00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:23.460
♫ Because none of that matters at all ♫

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:25.620
♫ As long as our hearts are one ♫

00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:27.480
♫ As long as you are with me ♫

00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.830
♫ As long as we love each other ♫

00:56:29.830 --> 00:56:34.400
♫ We don't have to tell anyone ♫
