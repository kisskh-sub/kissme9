00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:05.719

Grand Secretary.

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:35.560
Your grace is beyond repaying.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.290
In the next life, I shall serve you
as a beast of burden to repay my debt.

No need to wait till the next.

Right now,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.080
I have an important task
that needs your aid.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.159
Please speak, Sir.

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:46.500
By His Majesty's decree,

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.639
General Fuyao is appointed
to oversee all Nanjiang command.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.960
On imperial order, you will negotiate peace
with the King of Nanjiang.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.479
You must depart at once without delay.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.319
By royal decree.

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:08.439
I

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.560
shall not fail this mission.

(Xiuwende Hall)

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.080
Pingning.

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:20.159
Why can't I pass the throne to you?

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:21.800
Even if you would,

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.240
I would not take it.

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:24.719
I am tired.

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:27.000
Not just of the palace,

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.159
even the capital exhausts me.

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:30.520
It has been long enough.

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:32.560
I should leave all this behind,

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.360
and live a life of my own.

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:36.280
Pingning.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.680
Please stay.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.080
Stay with me a while longer, I beg you.

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.120
You still have
the Grand Secretary. He...

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.280
If Your Highness leaves,

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:47.080
how could I alone

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.599
support His Majesty properly?

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:54.759
Grand Secretary.

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:58.759
No matter what,
we cannot return to the past.

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.000
If we face each other day after day,
it will only bring pain.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.199
Then let it go.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.879
What?

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.439
The past cannot be reached.

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.330
But the future is ours to pursue.

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:12.920
Allow me to walk beside Your Highness,

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.240
and build a new tomorrow.

00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:25.319
From now on,

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:28.560
I ask for your guidance,
Grand Secretary.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:36.920
The same to Your Highness.

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:39.160
Report.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.120
News from the front.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.040
Peace talks succeeded.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.759
Within three days,

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.759
the Nanjiang army
will withdraw from the border.

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:48.600
Very good.

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:51.680
Peace will finally
return across all lands.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.920
May blessings endure.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.480
Heaven protects Jing.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.879
Grand Secretary.

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:08.759
Quick.

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:10.040
Help me, quickly.

I take my leave.)

Pingning.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.879
No. Something is wrong.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.370
The Grand Secretary has escaped.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.639
Xing, where is the Princess Royal?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.800
Your Majesty.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.879
Turn it over.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.890
Take care, Your Majesty.

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:39.639
Grand Secretary.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.079
Pingning.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.600
You both…

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:48.439
Come back.

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:51.060
(Xiuwende Hall)

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:52.360
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.639
let us continue where we left off.

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:55.839
The tale goes on,

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.600
about Mr. Qingya.

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:58.680
It is said

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:01.720
he was a nine-tailed fox spirit
who cultivated for a thousand years.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.639
He and our Princess Pingning

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:05.399
were fated by heaven.

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:08.439
He once left his mortal body

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.600
and guarded her in Beijiang,

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.399
keeping her safe
through countless trials.

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:14.160
Such a pity,

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:17.279
that Grand Secretary Li Yuanze
stood in the way.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.560
He loved the Princess deeply,

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:23.800
and drove Mr. Qingya away without mercy.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.360
A pity,

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.480
truly lamentable.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.000
However,

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.399
recently

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:31.560
rumors have been circulating.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.000
Some claim they saw the Grand Secretary

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:36.160
standing entranced beneath the moon,

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.600
his silhouette

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:39.560
astonishingly similar

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.720
to that very fox spirit of legend.

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:47.439
Young Master,

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.759
a true gentleman
would never steal another's love.

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:52.480
I have overstepped.

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:54.399
An apology is not enough.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.319
You owe me something in return.

00:06:58.759 --> 00:06:59.730
What would the lady like?

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.680
Perhaps

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.480

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:07.079
