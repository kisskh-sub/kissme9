Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:18.605
Before you ask for good love,
try being good love for someone first.

00:00:21.815 --> 00:00:23.234
I’m just trying to be a slightly better person.

00:00:23.234 --> 00:00:24.525
You act like you’ve seen a ghost.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:25.814
You don’t have to force it.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.324
You can just be yourself.

00:00:27.324 --> 00:00:30.526
So when I see you having nightmares
and waking up at night all the time,

00:00:30.704 --> 00:00:32.395
you’re actually…

00:00:32.484 --> 00:00:33.984
I know it’s hard to believe.

00:00:34.163 --> 00:00:35.572
But I’ve proved everything.

00:00:35.572 --> 00:00:38.995
So what happens to you and me
way in the future?

00:00:39.463 --> 00:00:40.496
We’re boyfriends.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.887
What?

00:00:43.247 --> 00:00:44.482
You and I love each other.

00:00:47.336 --> 00:00:49.036
We do love each other.

00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:30.770
Are you kidding me?

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.053
I wish I were.

00:01:37.461 --> 00:01:38.031
Why?

00:01:39.123 --> 00:01:40.960
After knowing that
you and I end up together in the future,

00:01:41.852 --> 00:01:43.089
you feel grossed out?

00:01:46.121 --> 00:01:46.828
No.

00:01:48.634 --> 00:01:50.031
I just think it’s a waste of time.

00:01:51.614 --> 00:01:52.419
A waste of time?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.044
If we already know we love each other,

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.709
why waste time
pretending to hate each other, right?

00:02:01.273 --> 00:02:03.440
So… now what?

00:02:03.797 --> 00:02:04.994
What do you mean?

00:02:05.596 --> 00:02:06.567
You and I…

00:02:07.615 --> 00:02:08.602
what do we do now?

00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:13.588
We’re boyfriends, of course.

00:02:14.435 --> 00:02:15.516
What the hell are we waiting for?

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:30.255
Ow!

00:02:31.281 --> 00:02:31.874
Jinn!

00:04:21.121 --> 00:04:23.361
Should I sell your car to a used-car market?

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.410
I don’t think you should.

00:04:26.101 --> 00:04:26.986
This isn’t funny.

00:04:28.212 --> 00:04:29.644
I’m sorry, Mom.

00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:31.717
I regret what I did.

00:04:31.717 --> 00:04:33.599
You’re not a kid anymore, Jerome.

00:04:33.867 --> 00:04:35.950
Do you realize how worried we were?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.561
And Jinn even had to
go out and help look for you.

00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:40.562
It was no trouble at all, Auntie Jen.

00:04:40.785 --> 00:04:41.689
As a friend—

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:43.329
So you two are on the same team now?

00:04:44.935 --> 00:04:45.664
No, ma’am.

00:04:45.664 --> 00:04:46.966
Please continue, Auntie Jen.

00:04:46.966 --> 00:04:48.097
Hey, Jinn!

00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:51.949
Dad, help me please.

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:53.434
I’m with your mom on this.

00:04:54.928 --> 00:04:57.456
What you did today was
extremely dangerous, you know?

00:04:57.902 --> 00:05:01.937
Your wrist hasn’t fully healed
and you haven’t driven in a while.

00:05:02.317 --> 00:05:04.054
How could you
get back on the racetrack like that?

00:05:04.232 --> 00:05:07.311
Your punishment is
car confiscation indefinitely,

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:10.961
and a 2,000-baht deduction
from your monthly allowance.

00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:11.973
Holy shit!

00:05:15.298 --> 00:05:17.336
Sorry, that was supposed to stay in my head.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.342
I’m gonna…

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.611
go to bed.

00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:21.969
I’m so sleepy. Goodnight.

00:05:22.125 --> 00:05:24.370
Jinn, stay with me.

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:26.154
No one can help you.

00:05:27.982 --> 00:05:30.180
I’m sorry. It’s my fault.

00:05:40.253 --> 00:05:41.175
Who are you, ma’am?

00:05:41.799 --> 00:05:42.842
What are you doing in my house?

00:05:44.938 --> 00:05:49.086
Come on. Stop sulking already.

00:05:50.268 --> 00:05:51.791
Want a slice of apple?

00:05:53.575 --> 00:05:54.146
Ah…

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:57.996
There you go. Good?

00:05:57.996 --> 00:05:59.873
Why are you making that face?

00:05:59.873 --> 00:06:01.091
It’s so sour.

00:06:01.225 --> 00:06:02.237
So where exactly did you go?

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:05.205
I told you, I had errands to run.

00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:07.189
Errands or a trip?

00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:09.230
Why am I hearing two different stories?

00:06:11.415 --> 00:06:12.858
I did run errands first.

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:15.391
But then I finished early,

00:06:15.391 --> 00:06:16.514
so I went on a trip afterward.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:17.609
That sounds suspicious.

00:06:19.214 --> 00:06:20.775
Suspicious how?

00:06:24.164 --> 00:06:28.544
When you stay at the condo and leave me
alone in this house for months, I don’t sulk.

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:31.433
I just went on a short trip with friends.

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:33.544
Stop being upset already.

00:06:33.834 --> 00:06:34.446
Yeah?

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.757
Yeah?

00:06:39.544 --> 00:06:40.742
I was worried about you.

00:06:41.478 --> 00:06:42.463
I love you.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.403
I don’t want anyone
messing around with you.

00:06:44.403 --> 00:06:48.250
Alright, alright. I love you too, son.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.451
You’re the only one I have,
and I love you the most.

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:53.363
Hm? Don’t sulk.

00:06:53.831 --> 00:06:55.133
Are you having a secret boyfriend or what?

00:06:56.203 --> 00:06:57.093
No!

00:06:57.093 --> 00:06:58.049
Not the high pitch.

00:06:58.049 --> 00:06:59.006
No.

00:06:59.274 --> 00:07:00.137
Your eyes are twitching.

00:07:01.341 --> 00:07:02.355
Mom!

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:05.147
What? They’re not twitching.

00:07:05.147 --> 00:07:05.986
They’re not.

00:07:05.986 --> 00:07:07.335
No secret boyfriend.

00:07:07.335 --> 00:07:08.250
This is so fishy.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.577
I can’t sleep.

00:08:01.141 --> 00:08:01.872
What?

00:08:02.964 --> 00:08:03.674
I.

00:08:03.674 --> 00:08:04.321
Can’t.

00:08:04.321 --> 00:08:04.857
Sleep.

00:08:06.306 --> 00:08:07.841
What am I supposed to do?

00:08:10.628 --> 00:08:12.405
I want to cuddle my boyfriend.

00:08:31.179 --> 00:08:33.698
Didn’t I tell you to call me
if you were drunk so I could pick you up?

00:08:34.902 --> 00:08:35.573
Mm.

00:08:35.573 --> 00:08:36.676
Mm what?

00:08:36.921 --> 00:08:38.227
You’re not making any sense.

00:08:38.762 --> 00:08:39.520
Just go to bed.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.429
Why didn’t you call?

00:08:47.691 --> 00:08:48.480
Just walk.

00:08:54.711 --> 00:08:56.107
You can’t sleep and
you come bother someone else, huh?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.202
You’re not “someone else.”

00:09:01.202 --> 00:09:02.072
You’re my boyfriend.

00:09:08.538 --> 00:09:09.276
Sorry.

00:09:18.208 --> 00:09:19.308
Are you alright?

00:09:22.162 --> 00:09:23.217
I’m just not used to this.

00:09:25.759 --> 00:09:27.883
But we lived together
at your place for a month.

00:09:28.329 --> 00:09:31.815
Yeah, but we weren’t together as boyfriends.

00:09:34.245 --> 00:09:39.640
You’ve seen us in your dreams or visions
or whatever, so you understand everything.

00:09:40.844 --> 00:09:41.896
But don’t forget…

00:09:43.345 --> 00:09:48.320
for me, yesterday we still hated each other.

00:09:50.817 --> 00:09:52.344
If I make you uncomfortable,

00:09:53.236 --> 00:09:54.558
I can go back home.

00:09:56.386 --> 00:09:57.628
That’s not it.

00:10:03.737 --> 00:10:04.645
I don’t know.

00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:06.598
I honestly don’t.

00:10:14.491 --> 00:10:17.052
You’re not wrong to feel confused.

00:10:26.623 --> 00:10:31.356
It almost cost my life to understand all of this.

00:10:33.608 --> 00:10:37.293
So I’ll give you all the time you need.

00:10:39.768 --> 00:10:42.255
I won’t rush you or pressure you in any way.

00:10:45.845 --> 00:10:47.189
And if, in the end,

00:10:49.196 --> 00:10:53.406
we don’t end up loving
each other like in the future I saw,

00:10:57.999 --> 00:10:59.206
I’ll accept that.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.774
J…

00:11:00.975 --> 00:11:06.280
Because at least we’ll end up on good terms.

00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:09.292
We won’t spend our lives hating each other.

00:11:31.982 --> 00:11:32.695
I got this.

00:11:40.721 --> 00:11:41.979
How did you even get back here?

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.200
Let me think…

00:11:50.952 --> 00:11:51.646
Van?

00:11:52.003 --> 00:11:52.734
Jeez.

00:11:56.577 --> 00:11:58.183
You’re acting like my boyfriend.

00:11:59.298 --> 00:12:01.831
What if I actually like you for real?

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.331
What will I do?

00:12:07.385 --> 00:12:08.374
I’m just worried.

00:12:08.998 --> 00:12:10.983
I was afraid you’d get kicked around again.

00:12:14.572 --> 00:12:18.576
I was gonna call you, actually, but…

00:12:20.047 --> 00:12:21.624
Ta-da!

00:12:22.605 --> 00:12:23.318
Shit.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:50.716
- Jinn.
- J.

00:12:52.856 --> 00:12:53.886
You go first.

00:12:54.599 --> 00:12:57.680
I just wanted to say goodnight.

00:13:06.768 --> 00:13:07.638
What about you?

00:13:07.638 --> 00:13:08.697
Why did you call me?

00:13:11.707 --> 00:13:14.543
I want to know about your dreams.

00:13:16.126 --> 00:13:18.368
What are they like? The things you see?

00:13:18.613 --> 00:13:19.787
Is it like in the movies?

00:13:21.392 --> 00:13:24.942
Do you sense it
when something’s about to happen?

00:13:25.767 --> 00:13:26.706
How does it work?

00:13:27.375 --> 00:13:28.908
They’re like normal dreams.

00:13:29.644 --> 00:13:32.290
There are images and voices.

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:34.971
What’s weird is…

00:13:36.911 --> 00:13:38.645
most of them end up happening for real.

00:13:44.798 --> 00:13:47.598
What about when
you saved me from that bike?

00:13:53.216 --> 00:13:57.187
Did you see that exact scene in your dream?

00:14:11.466 --> 00:14:12.110
J!

00:14:12.467 --> 00:14:13.869
Did you change the future?

00:14:22.602 --> 00:14:23.749
What’s bothering you?

00:14:26.068 --> 00:14:28.237
From what I’ve seen in the movies,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.329
when you decide to change something,

00:14:33.176 --> 00:14:36.873
it affects the future. Right?

00:14:44.966 --> 00:14:46.391
But this isn’t a movie.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.683
This is our life.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.155
Look at it another way.

00:14:55.337 --> 00:14:58.409
If I were the one getting hit by that bike,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.510
you would’ve done the same thing.

00:15:15.678 --> 00:15:16.608
Don’t overthink it.

00:15:17.611 --> 00:15:18.562
Get some sleep.

00:15:39.516 --> 00:15:40.856
Can I help with anything?

00:15:41.324 --> 00:15:42.963
I’ll put this on the table, Mom.

00:15:42.963 --> 00:15:43.463
Sure.

00:16:11.136 --> 00:16:11.636
Hey.

00:16:12.012 --> 00:16:13.276
Morning, Gorgeous.

00:16:13.276 --> 00:16:13.963
Hey.

00:16:14.475 --> 00:16:16.135
Did you sleep here last night, J?

00:16:18.496 --> 00:16:19.263
That’s right.

00:16:19.263 --> 00:16:20.694
My AC broke.

00:16:21.717 --> 00:16:22.249
Alright.

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:24.697
I just finished making breakfast.

00:16:24.697 --> 00:16:25.689
Stay and eat with us.

00:16:28.065 --> 00:16:29.484
Can I help with anything?

00:16:30.762 --> 00:16:32.381
I’ll put this on the table, Mom.

00:16:32.381 --> 00:16:32.881
Sure.

00:16:40.056 --> 00:16:42.175
What did you call me just now, J?

00:16:44.161 --> 00:16:45.359
That came out wrong, Auntie Jan.

00:16:45.524 --> 00:16:47.615
I’ll take these two glasses too.

00:16:48.172 --> 00:16:48.841
Sure.

00:17:01.397 --> 00:17:02.236
- Mom!
- Jeez!

00:17:02.687 --> 00:17:03.444
What?!

00:17:03.444 --> 00:17:04.308
What are you doing?

00:17:05.917 --> 00:17:06.952
You’re staring.

00:17:08.381 --> 00:17:09.246
A little more.

00:17:13.566 --> 00:17:15.492
Hey, sit down.

00:17:17.327 --> 00:17:18.806
J, is your hand fully healed?

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:21.355
Yes, Auntie Jan.

00:17:22.017 --> 00:17:24.651
The doctor said I can
go back to my normal routine.

00:17:24.967 --> 00:17:26.574
But I’m still not allowed to drive.

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:29.633
Then you can use
Jinn’s driving service for now.

00:17:29.844 --> 00:17:30.784
He’s all yours.

00:17:33.205 --> 00:17:34.159
Can I?

00:17:35.362 --> 00:17:36.373
Pay half the gas bill.

00:17:42.659 --> 00:17:47.124
I’m happy you guys are close.

00:17:47.506 --> 00:17:48.524
I’m happy too.

00:17:51.171 --> 00:17:51.700
Right?

00:17:55.686 --> 00:17:56.429
Just eat.

00:18:11.149 --> 00:18:12.568
Gosh, this is torture.

00:18:14.584 --> 00:18:16.593
Remember this feeling.

00:18:17.134 --> 00:18:19.997
Remind yourself before
you put alcohol in your mouth again.

00:18:23.787 --> 00:18:25.160
My head’s exploding.

00:18:25.506 --> 00:18:26.864
Are you sure you’re okay?

00:18:27.255 --> 00:18:28.181
I’m good.

00:18:28.753 --> 00:18:30.411
You can just skip today.

00:18:30.411 --> 00:18:31.127
It’s fine.

00:18:32.075 --> 00:18:35.915
If I can lift a glass, I can turn book pages.

00:18:41.867 --> 00:18:42.367
Here.

00:18:43.495 --> 00:18:44.997
It’s my old phone.

00:18:45.177 --> 00:18:46.342
Your SIM card’s already in it.

00:18:46.643 --> 00:18:47.741
Use this for now.

00:18:48.719 --> 00:18:49.467
Where’s my phone?

00:18:49.813 --> 00:18:52.009
Shithead, don’t you remember anything?

00:18:52.686 --> 00:18:54.649
Your phone’s completely cracked.

00:18:54.845 --> 00:18:56.685
I put it in the bedside drawer.

00:18:56.926 --> 00:18:59.196
Restore your data when you get the time.

00:19:00.144 --> 00:19:00.729
It’s all good.

00:19:01.075 --> 00:19:02.397
Nothing important in there anyway.

00:19:03.736 --> 00:19:05.864
Not even something you want to keep?

00:19:07.067 --> 00:19:07.951
You know me.

00:19:08.056 --> 00:19:09.942
Nothing in my life is memorable.

00:19:15.508 --> 00:19:16.906
- Hey.
- Hm?

00:19:17.132 --> 00:19:19.040
- I’m finally free this Saturday.
- Um-hum.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.050
I can go with you now.

00:19:22.983 --> 00:19:24.459
I thought I’d just sneak out by myself.

00:19:26.099 --> 00:19:28.174
You’ve got an excellent memory.

00:19:28.324 --> 00:19:29.866
You don’t want me to come along anymore?

00:19:30.408 --> 00:19:31.424
Hey, it’s not that.

00:19:33.139 --> 00:19:36.513
I planned to gossip about you to my parents.

00:19:38.032 --> 00:19:39.717
If you come, I won’t get to say everything.

00:19:42.424 --> 00:19:43.763
- Van.
- Hm?

00:19:44.169 --> 00:19:47.783
You can put on that tough-guy act
or that reckless act with anyone.

00:19:48.806 --> 00:19:51.791
But with me, you don’t have to.

00:19:58.955 --> 00:20:00.602
Eat, so we can get to class on time.

00:20:02.391 --> 00:20:04.890
I’m gonna take a quick nap.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:05.731
I can’t keep going.

00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:18.304
Here they are.

00:20:18.469 --> 00:20:19.153
What’s up?

00:20:19.589 --> 00:20:20.625
What kind of trouble
did you get into this time?

00:20:21.227 --> 00:20:22.427
News travels fast.

00:20:23.329 --> 00:20:24.217
So, how did it go?

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.847
I didn’t see anything last night.

00:20:33.341 --> 00:20:34.166
Farm knows about this?

00:20:36.573 --> 00:20:37.594
You already told Jinn?

00:20:41.047 --> 00:20:41.968
Hold on.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.859
Do any of you care to
share anything with us?

00:20:47.506 --> 00:20:48.044
Hm?

00:21:01.181 --> 00:21:01.855
What are you doing?

00:21:04.803 --> 00:21:06.599
Looks like someone doesn’t plan
on going home anytime soon.

00:21:07.261 --> 00:21:08.668
So I’m clearing half the space for you.

00:21:10.217 --> 00:21:12.102
If you want me to stay, just say so.

00:21:12.252 --> 00:21:14.246
Don’t make excuses.

00:21:15.329 --> 00:21:16.909
You asshole.

00:21:17.165 --> 00:21:17.808
Just go home.

00:21:18.109 --> 00:21:19.864
I’m kidding. Come on.

00:21:21.699 --> 00:21:23.803
You’re not staying for free, though.

00:21:24.164 --> 00:21:26.142
Everything is split half-half.

00:21:27.506 --> 00:21:29.125
Come on, my allowance is being cut.

00:21:30.147 --> 00:21:31.212
Have some mercy.

00:21:31.588 --> 00:21:34.083
Um… no.

00:21:43.715 --> 00:21:44.369
Are you throwing it away?

00:21:46.685 --> 00:21:47.198
Yeah.

00:21:47.709 --> 00:21:48.466
Why?

00:21:50.617 --> 00:21:51.763
It’s just me ranting about you.

00:21:52.139 --> 00:21:53.062
Why keep it?

00:21:53.318 --> 00:21:55.773
But you also confessed you love me in here.

00:21:56.465 --> 00:21:57.166
Can I keep it?

00:22:02.551 --> 00:22:04.030
There are still plenty of blank pages.

00:22:05.068 --> 00:22:07.036
Can I write on the other half?

00:22:07.893 --> 00:22:09.579
What? What are you gonna write?

00:22:14.964 --> 00:22:16.097
My love for you.

00:22:18.875 --> 00:22:19.841
Just buy a new notebook.

00:22:22.217 --> 00:22:25.474
You’re really gonna write love notes
in a book where half of it is insults?

00:22:25.805 --> 00:22:26.910
Not to mention the cover is black.

00:22:27.421 --> 00:22:29.369
Isn’t that bad luck?

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:33.872
But your feelings are in here.

00:22:34.985 --> 00:22:35.885
Let me keep it.

00:22:38.953 --> 00:22:40.214
Fine. Suit yourself.

00:22:40.605 --> 00:22:41.188
Do whatever you want.

00:22:57.434 --> 00:23:00.461
Whatever problems you have,
you can come talk to me, Van.

00:23:00.672 --> 00:23:02.821
You’re already like the other half of my life.

00:23:20.949 --> 00:23:21.980
It’s been five years.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:23.484
Time really flies.

00:23:25.975 --> 00:23:26.640
Oh, by the way,

00:23:27.457 --> 00:23:29.213
I’m staying at Farm’s place now.

00:23:30.622 --> 00:23:31.906
He’s here today too,

00:23:32.079 --> 00:23:33.810
so our gossip won’t be as fun.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.323
You’ve been telling your parents about me?

00:23:39.773 --> 00:23:41.387
Your secrets are all out.

00:23:42.122 --> 00:23:43.711
Be nice.

00:23:44.262 --> 00:23:47.269
If you’re mean to me,
I’ll tell Mom and Dad to haunt you.

00:23:48.147 --> 00:23:48.873
Remember his face.

00:23:54.162 --> 00:23:56.156
Hello. I’m Farm.

00:23:56.156 --> 00:23:57.964
The one Van’s been telling you about.

00:23:58.638 --> 00:23:59.809
Don’t worry about him.

00:24:00.687 --> 00:24:02.999
He might live a stupid life sometimes, but…

00:24:03.162 --> 00:24:04.227
I’ll help take care of him.

00:24:17.656 --> 00:24:19.257
Do you come here often?

00:24:21.381 --> 00:24:23.162
On their anniversary.

00:24:23.713 --> 00:24:26.024
Or when I’m down.

00:24:28.413 --> 00:24:29.240
Not that often, though.

00:24:33.651 --> 00:24:37.295
When you feel low,
do you always talk to them?

00:24:39.623 --> 00:24:42.117
Yeah. I just want a place to vent.

00:24:43.689 --> 00:24:47.284
Is it okay to talk when no one answers back?

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.114
Sometimes, I don’t want comfort
or anyone stepping into my problems.

00:24:51.788 --> 00:24:53.356
I just want to let it out.

00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:00.240
Whatever problems you have,
you can come talk to me, Van.

00:25:00.873 --> 00:25:03.277
And if you just want me to listen,
I can do that too.

00:25:03.992 --> 00:25:06.232
You’re already like the other half of my life.

00:25:06.457 --> 00:25:07.412
What more do you want?

00:25:16.164 --> 00:25:17.683
Van, it stinks!

00:25:18.663 --> 00:25:19.970
Van!

00:25:39.132 --> 00:25:41.125
Seriously, you can just tell me anything.

00:25:42.432 --> 00:25:45.864
But you don’t tell me everything.

00:25:47.661 --> 00:25:48.579
What are you talking about?

00:25:51.785 --> 00:25:52.720
Never mind.

00:25:53.128 --> 00:25:54.302
We can just go on like this.

00:25:59.857 --> 00:26:00.527
Should we head back?

00:26:01.201 --> 00:26:02.067
Or is there somewhere else you want to go?

00:26:02.475 --> 00:26:03.238
Should we eat first?

00:26:03.565 --> 00:26:04.337
I’m buying.

00:26:04.759 --> 00:26:05.435
Why?

00:26:06.027 --> 00:26:10.172
Because Dad and Mom
left me plenty of money.

00:26:10.621 --> 00:26:15.118
And I can feel
they want you to help me spend it.

00:26:17.732 --> 00:26:22.474
Then I should thank
your mom and dad for the meal.

00:26:22.474 --> 00:26:23.620
Not you.

00:26:24.865 --> 00:26:26.245
How about you eat this?

00:26:26.735 --> 00:26:27.486
Don’t.

00:26:28.139 --> 00:26:29.691
Come on. Let’s go get something.

00:26:47.989 --> 00:26:49.137
I’m going to my mom’s boutique.

00:26:50.587 --> 00:26:51.251
What for?

00:26:51.537 --> 00:26:53.041
I usually hang out
in the secret room on my days off.

00:26:54.328 --> 00:26:55.102
You want to come?

00:26:56.613 --> 00:26:57.253
I do.

00:26:57.319 --> 00:26:58.477
Give me ten minutes to change.

00:26:58.477 --> 00:27:00.504
You’re like a dog
that just heard it’s getting a walk.

00:27:03.077 --> 00:27:03.776
Hey.

00:27:04.899 --> 00:27:05.949
J, you asshole.

00:27:23.015 --> 00:27:23.811
What are you looking at?

00:27:26.262 --> 00:27:28.663
You told my parents you’d take care of me.

00:27:29.419 --> 00:27:30.128
What did you mean?

00:27:32.048 --> 00:27:33.738
Don’t I already do that?

00:27:34.199 --> 00:27:35.486
That’s not what I mean.

00:27:35.833 --> 00:27:36.884
I mean…

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:40.525
You mean what?

00:27:43.547 --> 00:27:45.061
How long are you
planning to keep doing this?

00:27:46.759 --> 00:27:50.983
I guess, until someone comes along
and takes care of you instead of me.

00:27:52.964 --> 00:27:56.018
What if… no one does?

00:27:57.202 --> 00:27:58.094
Someone will.

00:27:58.237 --> 00:27:59.954
Don’t you want to take care of me forever?

00:28:03.855 --> 00:28:05.309
Do you want me to?

00:28:06.841 --> 00:28:09.144
You and I are just built the same.

00:28:09.532 --> 00:28:10.870
We step forward, then back.

00:28:11.176 --> 00:28:12.451
Forward, then back.

00:28:12.839 --> 00:28:14.177
Over and over.

00:28:14.606 --> 00:28:15.252
No.

00:28:16.959 --> 00:28:18.393
I’ll stand still.

00:28:18.761 --> 00:28:20.048
The rest is your call.

00:28:33.838 --> 00:28:34.737
What are you doing?

00:28:35.839 --> 00:28:36.847
Eating.

00:28:57.387 --> 00:28:58.305
- Boo!
- Oops!

00:28:58.636 --> 00:28:59.931
I missed you.

00:29:01.994 --> 00:29:04.197
- Hello, Auntie Jan.
- Hi, dear.

00:29:09.519 --> 00:29:11.319
Whose suit is this, Mom?

00:29:12.319 --> 00:29:13.311
Uh…

00:29:15.169 --> 00:29:16.627
It’s a mock-up for the new collection.

00:29:21.141 --> 00:29:23.598
So you’re making men’s clothing
for this collection?

00:29:29.051 --> 00:29:33.079
Look at you. You look so handsome.

00:29:33.385 --> 00:29:36.054
Mom, don’t state the obvious.

00:29:36.953 --> 00:29:38.788
You look like your dad when he was young.

00:29:42.505 --> 00:29:43.973
Why are you bringing him up?

00:29:46.759 --> 00:29:53.214
Aren’t you glad
you look like a national superstar?

00:29:54.051 --> 00:29:54.788
No.

00:29:56.932 --> 00:29:59.272
You’re my parent. I have only you.

00:30:03.193 --> 00:30:04.306
Mm.

00:30:04.878 --> 00:30:05.914
I’m just teasing.

00:30:06.731 --> 00:30:08.784
Sorry, honey.

00:30:10.377 --> 00:30:12.235
Let’s not fight, okay?

00:30:13.767 --> 00:30:15.555
It’s just the two of us, yeah?

00:30:24.779 --> 00:30:26.098
Mom, he left us!

00:30:29.978 --> 00:30:31.359
How come you forgot that so easily?

00:30:35.259 --> 00:30:36.761
Let me make it up to you, son.

00:30:36.761 --> 00:30:37.873
You’re not my dad!

00:30:37.873 --> 00:30:38.600
Jinn.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.334
And I’m not your son!

00:30:39.334 --> 00:30:40.218
- J.
- Jinn!

00:30:43.833 --> 00:30:44.438
What?

00:30:44.949 --> 00:30:46.665
J, are you okay, dear?

00:30:47.482 --> 00:30:48.442
Are you feeling unwell?

00:30:50.157 --> 00:30:50.884
I’m fine, Auntie.

00:30:51.517 --> 00:30:52.601
What did you say?

00:30:52.759 --> 00:30:53.862
I asked if you wanted to go upstairs.

00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:57.968
Ah, sure.

00:30:58.213 --> 00:31:00.099
You two go hang out upstairs.

00:31:00.099 --> 00:31:01.509
I’ll order some snacks for you.

00:31:12.073 --> 00:31:14.374
So you like spending time
here on your days off?

00:31:16.498 --> 00:31:17.196
Mm.

00:31:18.503 --> 00:31:20.343
I come to see Mom
and do little things here and there.

00:31:24.632 --> 00:31:28.827
Are all these dresses your designs?

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:30.995
Yes.

00:31:32.302 --> 00:31:33.453
Just to pass the time.

00:31:34.495 --> 00:31:36.210
I want to be near my mom,

00:31:36.598 --> 00:31:38.856
but I don’t want to deal with customers.

00:31:41.123 --> 00:31:42.358
So you hide in here?

00:31:43.767 --> 00:31:46.060
Mm. Mom gave me this room.

00:31:47.857 --> 00:31:50.960
Besides clothes, do you make anything else?

00:31:51.613 --> 00:31:53.645
Anything with fabric.

00:31:54.462 --> 00:31:58.417
Hats, bags, even tablecloths.

00:31:59.561 --> 00:32:00.869
What are you making today?

00:32:02.176 --> 00:32:03.121
What do you want?

00:32:03.427 --> 00:32:04.274
I can make it for you.

00:32:33.463 --> 00:32:34.327
Your father…

00:32:38.207 --> 00:32:39.921
You think you’ll ever be able to forgive him?

00:32:44.434 --> 00:32:45.368
Why are you asking?

00:32:49.013 --> 00:32:50.453
Just wondering.

00:32:53.067 --> 00:32:54.385
Did you see a vision of him coming back?

00:32:55.753 --> 00:32:56.668
No.

00:32:57.587 --> 00:32:58.382
It’s not that.

00:33:00.751 --> 00:33:03.643
If you didn’t, then don’t ask me that again.

00:33:04.378 --> 00:33:06.865
We cut ties the day
he told me not to call him Dad.

00:33:08.233 --> 00:33:09.554
Let me know if you need anything, Jan.

00:33:09.881 --> 00:33:10.665
Go on.

00:33:11.564 --> 00:33:12.827
Where are you going, Dad?

00:33:13.746 --> 00:33:15.174
Do you want this uncle to be your dad?

00:33:17.277 --> 00:33:18.409
I’m not your father.

00:33:18.817 --> 00:33:20.126
I can’t be.

00:33:21.576 --> 00:33:22.464
Dad!

00:33:22.759 --> 00:33:23.812
- Jinn.
- Dad!

00:33:46.697 --> 00:33:48.043
Waking up early is pretty nice.

00:33:48.247 --> 00:33:49.428
We get a lot done.

00:33:50.347 --> 00:33:51.819
And we still have half the day left.

00:33:52.554 --> 00:33:53.989
Aren’t you going out tonight?

00:33:54.316 --> 00:33:55.679
My liver is on a break.

00:33:55.679 --> 00:33:56.406
Is it?

00:33:57.141 --> 00:33:59.195
I didn’t know you could be sensible.

00:34:02.279 --> 00:34:03.350
What will you do this evening?

00:34:04.575 --> 00:34:05.271
Why do you ask?

00:35:10.455 --> 00:35:11.121
J.

00:35:52.637 --> 00:35:55.456
(I like it when you focus. It’s cute.)

00:36:17.822 --> 00:36:20.462
I shouldn’t have wondered
what you were doing this evening.

00:36:21.851 --> 00:36:25.501
Not everyone gets to
sleep in my son’s secret room.

00:36:42.857 --> 00:36:44.790
Just in time for dinner.

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:46.294
Where’s J?

00:36:47.128 --> 00:36:48.452
He’s asleep.

00:36:50.955 --> 00:36:52.552
I’m envious.

00:36:52.552 --> 00:36:56.225
Not everyone gets to
sleep in my son’s secret room.

00:37:00.461 --> 00:37:01.830
What are you saying?

00:37:01.937 --> 00:37:03.438
Well, it’s true.

00:37:03.438 --> 00:37:06.314
Even I need your permission to go in there.

00:37:06.314 --> 00:37:09.027
So yes, not just anyone can be in that room.

00:37:10.118 --> 00:37:11.277
He’s my friend, Mom.

00:37:11.555 --> 00:37:13.844
If Farm, Van, or Mai came over,

00:37:14.743 --> 00:37:15.997
they could be in there too.

00:37:18.757 --> 00:37:19.466
Come on.

00:37:19.732 --> 00:37:20.412
Alright.

00:37:22.381 --> 00:37:24.243
How did you two become so close, though?

00:37:24.243 --> 00:37:25.409
Because you lived together?

00:37:26.393 --> 00:37:27.358
Kind of, Mom.

00:37:27.786 --> 00:37:29.352
And he’s not a bad person.

00:37:30.743 --> 00:37:33.588
If I’d known, I would’ve forced you two
to live together since the 7th grade.

00:37:34.123 --> 00:37:35.205
Gosh.

00:37:35.783 --> 00:37:38.660
Seriously, why do you
want us to be close so badly?

00:37:40.286 --> 00:37:41.796
His house is right across the street.

00:37:41.796 --> 00:37:43.809
His mom is my close friend.
You’re studying the same major.

00:37:43.809 --> 00:37:45.514
What’s the reason not to be close?

00:38:09.625 --> 00:38:13.631
(Thanks. But if you’ve got guts,
say it to my face, chicken.)

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:23.765
You should’ve cleaned this up.

00:38:24.492 --> 00:38:25.147
What?

00:38:25.732 --> 00:38:27.927
Hey, you’re awake.

00:38:28.483 --> 00:38:29.764
Let’s eat, dear.

00:38:29.935 --> 00:38:30.908
Yes, Auntie Jan.

00:38:34.064 --> 00:38:34.713
Eat.

00:38:37.879 --> 00:38:42.796
So, are you going back home
or back to your condo tonight?

00:38:44.828 --> 00:38:45.897
What do you want?

00:38:46.903 --> 00:38:47.817
Why are you asking me?

00:38:48.181 --> 00:38:49.093
It’s up to you.

00:38:51.596 --> 00:38:53.275
I’ll just go back to the condo.

00:38:54.965 --> 00:38:56.576
Leaving me alone in the house again?

00:38:56.576 --> 00:38:58.140
I guess it’s my turn to sulk.

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.447
Come on, I left my unfinished project there.

00:39:00.447 --> 00:39:02.040
I need to submit it on Monday.

00:39:03.216 --> 00:39:05.080
I’m only joking.

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:08.774
It’s all good. I’m used to being alone.

00:39:08.774 --> 00:39:10.892
Hey, don’t say that.

00:39:16.155 --> 00:39:16.933
What’s the matter?

00:39:18.687 --> 00:39:19.836
Nothing.

00:39:19.836 --> 00:39:22.118
Here, son. Eat up.

00:39:22.118 --> 00:39:22.856
Thank you.

00:39:22.984 --> 00:39:24.344
To make it up to you,

00:39:24.344 --> 00:39:27.248
I’ll clean up and close the boutique for you.

00:39:27.248 --> 00:39:27.965
How’s that?

00:39:29.463 --> 00:39:31.573
Can you do the dishes too?

00:39:33.285 --> 00:39:35.896
Don’t think so.

00:39:38.164 --> 00:39:38.842
Alright, fine.

00:39:51.797 --> 00:39:52.957
What’s with that face?

00:39:56.209 --> 00:39:59.761
Why did I have to help you
make it up to your mom?

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:01.313
Stop complaining.

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:02.849
It’s just a clean-up.

00:40:03.341 --> 00:40:04.763
Not “just.”

00:40:05.897 --> 00:40:10.504
We swept, mopped,
wiped the racks, and dusted everything.

00:40:10.932 --> 00:40:13.138
I almost died, you know?

00:40:13.972 --> 00:40:15.210
Stop stalling. Get up.

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:46.799
What?

00:40:48.596 --> 00:40:50.635
It’s something I promised to make for you.

00:41:01.218 --> 00:41:01.972
Well?

00:41:03.085 --> 00:41:04.160
Am I cute?

00:41:05.679 --> 00:41:06.583
Not really.

00:41:07.503 --> 00:41:10.034
Am I really not cute?

00:41:11.018 --> 00:41:12.108
No.

00:41:18.526 --> 00:41:20.993
But you are cute.

00:41:24.532 --> 00:41:26.343
You said I should
compliment you face-to-face.

00:41:27.263 --> 00:41:28.640
Here I am, doing just that.

00:41:31.592 --> 00:41:33.905
Nong Jinn, you’re so cute.

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:34.897
J!

00:41:35.774 --> 00:41:37.524
You’re dead. Don’t run.

00:41:47.017 --> 00:41:49.334
I shouldn’t have wondered
what you were doing this evening.

00:41:50.917 --> 00:41:51.895
Too late now.

00:41:53.286 --> 00:41:54.716
Will you excuse me?

00:41:54.716 --> 00:41:56.415
No!

00:41:57.701 --> 00:41:59.613
If you’re gonna stick with me,
you have to stay fit.

00:42:01.132 --> 00:42:02.017
Sit down.

00:42:02.787 --> 00:42:05.118
Why do you have to force me?

00:42:07.202 --> 00:42:09.256
Who taught you to wear sandals to the gym?

00:42:09.769 --> 00:42:10.870
Well, I didn’t know.

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:12.496
Why didn’t you tell me
you were coming here?

00:42:15.448 --> 00:42:16.683
You’re all set.

00:42:26.972 --> 00:42:28.546
How thoughtful of you.

00:42:30.258 --> 00:42:31.919
As if I love this so much.

00:42:32.347 --> 00:42:33.766
Gosh.

00:42:34.023 --> 00:42:35.178
It’s just exercise.

00:42:35.413 --> 00:42:37.045
Don’t act like you’re dying.

00:42:38.158 --> 00:42:39.843
Go easy on me.

00:42:39.843 --> 00:42:41.719
Just put them on. Hurry.

00:42:49.365 --> 00:42:50.571
Here. Lift this.

00:42:51.092 --> 00:42:52.385
Easy.

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:54.867
Shit.

00:43:08.331 --> 00:43:09.058
One more.

00:43:13.414 --> 00:43:14.713
The last time. I’m serious.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:23.296
One.

00:43:25.093 --> 00:43:26.507
Two.

00:43:39.715 --> 00:43:41.175
Please let me go.

00:43:41.432 --> 00:43:42.443
One more set.

00:43:47.652 --> 00:43:49.231
I can’t anymore.

00:43:59.308 --> 00:44:01.186
Where are you going, Van?

00:44:01.186 --> 00:44:02.514
Come back here.

00:44:02.792 --> 00:44:03.961
Come, my dear friend.

00:44:06.999 --> 00:44:09.939
Argh!

00:45:10.148 --> 00:45:10.797
J.

00:45:16.792 --> 00:45:17.673
I’m right here.

00:45:20.091 --> 00:45:20.896
It’s okay.

00:45:21.902 --> 00:45:22.748
I’m here.

00:45:32.306 --> 00:45:32.842
Feeling better?

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:36.255
Mm.

00:45:45.299 --> 00:45:46.609
What did you see in your dream?

00:45:52.706 --> 00:45:53.699
I don’t remember.

00:45:57.101 --> 00:45:58.560
But you never forget.

00:46:07.353 --> 00:46:08.048
Why?

00:46:08.172 --> 00:46:10.055
Was I in bad shape?

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:13.686
Did I die?

00:46:14.199 --> 00:46:15.214
Don’t say things like that again.

00:46:24.839 --> 00:46:25.775
But I’m not scared

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:28.856
because you’d help me in time.

00:46:33.392 --> 00:46:34.042
Right?

00:46:36.438 --> 00:46:37.163
Mm.

00:46:44.312 --> 00:46:45.855
Let’s go to bed. I’m tired.

00:46:47.481 --> 00:46:48.158
You go ahead.

00:46:52.009 --> 00:46:52.993
Are you scared you’ll dream again?

00:47:00.172 --> 00:47:02.660
J, why don’t you see a doctor?

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:06.442
It’s not that I don’t believe you
or think you’re sick.

00:47:08.025 --> 00:47:10.841
I do believe you. I’m just worried.

00:47:10.841 --> 00:47:11.785
Why worry about me?

00:47:14.267 --> 00:47:17.323
Because it keeps you from resting.

00:47:18.093 --> 00:47:19.428
You wake up at night.

00:47:19.428 --> 00:47:20.444
You don’t get proper sleep.

00:47:20.872 --> 00:47:24.797
If you see a doctor,
maybe you’ll get meds or therapy.

00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:26.099
It might help.

00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:29.520
What if going to a doctor
makes me stop seeing the visions?

00:47:30.654 --> 00:47:31.709
How will I help you then?

00:47:59.094 --> 00:47:59.713
J…

00:48:00.772 --> 00:48:02.593
I don’t want you to only worry about me.

00:48:03.898 --> 00:48:05.004
You worry about me.

00:48:05.667 --> 00:48:07.321
I worry about your health too.

00:48:10.958 --> 00:48:13.338
I promise I won’t push myself too far.

00:48:16.226 --> 00:48:17.365
But right now, I can still handle it.

00:48:26.546 --> 00:48:27.663
Have you ever thought…

00:48:28.604 --> 00:48:31.243
what if all of this is just a coincidence?

00:48:31.821 --> 00:48:33.852
If you’re not really seeing the future,

00:48:34.012 --> 00:48:35.843
if we’re not boyfriends in ten years…

00:48:38.517 --> 00:48:39.407
what will that be?

00:48:45.631 --> 00:48:47.475
Then I guess… it’s only my feelings

00:48:51.027 --> 00:48:52.521
that came true.

00:49:31.857 --> 00:49:32.707
What’s up with these two?

00:49:32.707 --> 00:49:34.204
They stick together like a married couple.

00:49:34.311 --> 00:49:36.402
Why are you so cute?

00:49:36.972 --> 00:49:39.342
You’re the only one
who cares this much about me.

00:49:40.412 --> 00:49:41.240
Is something wrong?

00:49:42.117 --> 00:49:43.097
Would you like to be my boyfriend?

00:49:44.423 --> 00:49:45.812
Hey, Van!

00:49:46.582 --> 00:49:51.140
Even though I know you’ve had
a crush on me since you could walk…

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:52.049
Not true.

00:49:52.841 --> 00:49:55.236
I’m still gonna flirt with you.

00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:59.781
I will make you fall head over heels for me.
